<h5>Halfpastnow's Privacy Statement</h5>
<br><br>
Website Visitors
<br><br>
Like most website operators, Halfpastnow collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Halfpastnow's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Halfpastnow's visitors use its website. From time to time, Halfpastnow may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
<br><br>
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
<br><br>
Certain visitors to Halfpastnow's websites choose to interact with Halfpastnow in ways that require Halfpastnow to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Halfpastnow gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an Halfpastnow account to provide a username and email address. In each case, Halfpastnow collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Halfpastnow. Halfpastnow does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
<br><br>
Aggregated Statistics
<br><br>
Halfpastnow may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Halfpastnow may monitor the most popular posts on Halfpastnow.com. Halfpastnow may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Halfpastnow does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
<br><br>
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
<br><br>
Halfpastnow discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Halfpastnow's behalf or to provide services available at Halfpastnow's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Halfpastnow's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Halfpastnow will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Halfpastnow discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Halfpastnow believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Halfpastnow, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Halfpastnow website and have supplied your email address, Halfpastnow may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Halfpastnow and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Halfpastnow takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
