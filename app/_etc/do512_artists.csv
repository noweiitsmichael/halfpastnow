If I wouldn’t say it to you at a bar, I won’t say it lyrically.”Engineered by vintage aficionado Christopher Hoffee at CHAOS Recorders, Feral Flocks attests to the fact that Davenport’s fire is not fueled by grief and heartache alone. Rather, the band finds an uplifting groove that tells of newfound inspiration.Opening number “Ninjavitus” sets the tone with shimmering keys Greg Theilmann , a whimsical, mock-Orient guitar lead Andrew Armerding, Daniel Gallo’s driven bass lines, and beats backed by the calculating rhythms of Carlos Ortiz from Davenport’s prior outfit, Gun Runner.The band recently completed a video for “Ninjavitus” (directed by Eric Casas) poking fun at the daily promotional chores of just about every contemporary band, which requires everything from internet solicitations to sign spinning skills on a street corner.“Splendor,” continues the coltish resolve with a chorus that, minus the track’s New Wave abandon, could come off as bitter: “Oh, there you go, walking slow, and I need you there.”Instead, it rings of admiration.“Mystifying Oracle” elaborates on Feral Flocks’ quixotic disposition with expansive guitar hooks, ecstatic builds, and a star-crossed breakdown which wonders, “Am I ever gunna wake up where you are?”With a tour on the horizon (first stop, SXSW 2013) and two knockout albums under their belt, there’s no saying where the band will wake up next – but who cares?After all, up here in the Hills, the view is extraordinary.via Facebook","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">With the addition of samples, a couple guitars, and live traps backed by programmed beats, Hills Like Elephants announces their presence on the national scene with a dance-friendly re-imagination of indie rock, lo-fi disco, and what frontman Sean Davenport calls “Motown with drum machines.”</span><br><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">On their sophomore effort, Feral Flocks, San Diego indie soul stalwarts grow from a solo project of keyboard</span><span style=""display: inline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;""> crooner Davenport (Gun Runner, Abigail Warchild) into a full five-piece band.<br>(Feral Flocks REQ06 Requiemme Records/<span class=""caps"">BMG</span> Chrysalis – March 26, 2013)<br>Only months after the release of their debut The Endless Charade, Hills Like Elephants were crowned Best New Artist at the 2012 San Diego Music Awards and went on to play a series of hometown performances to venues so full, not even Hemmingway could get a drink.<br>“On The Endless Charade, I was harping on the idea of past relationships, but I was also trying to move on,” says Davenport. “Feral Flocks is more about noticing the subtleties of life, but I’m not trying to be profound.

Gunslinger for The Cramps. Six-string stylist for Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. The legendary Kid Congo Powers titles his new album on INTHERED Records GORILLA ROSE after artist/performer Gorilla Rose. As a teenage boy Kid met Gorilla thru seminal weirdo band, The Screamers in the emerging LA Punk music scene of the 70’s. He recalls, “Gorilla Rose was a close and constant presence and influence on The Screamers and me as a young pup. He was to The Screamers like Bobby Neuwirth was to Dylan, a jester of sorts, sparking many of their great lyric ideas. I still think GORILLA ROSE is the most fabulous nom de plume in history. His unsung specter had been in my mind a lot last year so I decided to title the album GORILLA ROSE to honor his name and bring him into rock n roll’s ongoing conversation.” While editing his fan club newsletters at a haunted Hollywood house, a teenage Kid Congo was also exposed to the sounds of Neu, Nico, Billie Holiday, and the “Susperia” movie soundtrack by Goblin. Along with Gorilla and Kid’s Garage rock pedigree, these past influences found their way back into his new album. For GORILLA ROSE Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds grabbed producer Jason Ward and hightailed it back to the magik gymnasium at The Harveyville Project, a high school in Kansas and also the scene of the crime of their much acclaimed 2009 release “Dracula Boots.” Kiki “El Coyote” Solis on bass and Ron “The Cap’n” Miller on drums along with, new Pink Monkey Bird, Jesse “The Candyman” Roberts (from Seattle’s The Ruby Doe) on guitar, keys and vocals firms up Kid Congo’s squawking flock. Brandishing 13 all original glam-tastic compositions, GORIILA ROSE blasts off with the explosive dance anthem “Bo Bo Boogaloo” wearing their 60’s Chicano Rock influence on their sleeves. Shake it don’t break it! That’s just the start of a wild ride thru funky but chic decadence (“Goldin Browne”) slip sliding rockabilly (“Hills Of Pills”) ,Teenage punkdom (“Our Other World”) mystic Kraut rock (“Bubble Trouble”) , baby-making sleaze (“Catsuit Fruit”), the best bad Peyote trip you ever took ( “Injun War Crimes.”) and even a velvety call from the beyond (Lullaby in Paradise). Finding inspiration in the past is what Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds do best. On this 2011 sonic trip, Kid brings his past into the present and names it after someone flamboyant and inspired.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-soft-white-sixties","The Soft White Sixties","San Francisco","","The Soft White Sixties, one of San Francisco’s most talked about bands, have been hailed by some press as legitimate heirs to the Maximum R&B moniker placed on The Who some 40-plus years ago; and while that’s not un-true, The Soft White Sixties offer so much more. Like a perfect collision between the sweetly subversive melodies of T-Rex and the hard-edged pop sensibilities of The Strokes, The Soft White Sixties’ brand of rock ‘n roll blends heavy, soulful grooves with a driving beat.Since releasing their debut EP in April of 2011, The Soft White Sixties have been busy. After immediately filling larger venues in their hometown, from Slim’s to The Great American Music Hall, they were invited to perform at festivals around the country. Over the last year and a half, The Soft White Sixties made appearances at The High Sierra Music Festival in Quincy, CA, The Harmony Festival in Sonoma, CA, The Treefort Music Festival in Boise, ID, CMJ in New York, NY, and SXSW in Austin, TX, where they shared the stages with bands like My Morning Jacket, Dr. Dog, Delta Spirit, and The Flaming Lips. In 2012, The Soft White Sixties successfully completed their first full US tour, going from coast to coast to play 25 shows in 30 days across 16 states. To coincide with the national tour, the band released a 9-episode documentary entitled “Knock It Loose: On The Road with The Soft White Sixties”, covering their first West Coast tour, produced by San Francisco’s own BAMM.tv. You can hear their music regularly spinning on radio stations like Live 105 and KUSF in San Francisco, KEXP in Seattle, WLOY in Maryland, and Radio Boise, and might catch some of their songs currently licensed for film and national television campaigns.With a new record on the horizon produced by Jim Greer (known for his work with Dan the Automator and most recently Foster the People’s platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated album, Torches), The Soft White Sixties show no signs of slowing down.“The Soft White Sixties look like they belong on a bigger stage.” - Michele McManmon, SF Examiner “Maximum R&B is what was used to describe The Who back in their prime, and Bay Area boys The Soft White Sixties are prime candidates to take that description as their own. Having just recently sold out a headlining gig at The Great American Music Hall, the quintet are laying down a sinfully soulful rock sound that always goes down smooth.” - Andrew Pohl, Noise Pop 2011 “Attendees who bump the seminal Nuggets garage rock compilations might suggest that a concoction of fun-loving, acid-tinged soul and bluesy guitar-rock co-indicates, on paper, gleefully chaotic and uneven musicianship. Perish the thought: the Sixties mold their muse into a modern soul-rock machine via a tight performance unencumbered by the large accompanying volumes of booze…Beyond the swamp-rock odes and sunny psychedelic blues, these guys were obviously having fun getting their work done.” - Mike Orne, SF Weekly “SF’s the Soft White Sixties sound like if Elton John wrote songs for CCR (use your imagination, and don’t think of the analogy as degrading), and went all over the place with them, sometimes diving into the heavy guitar of Tony Iommi, other times skipping along with the Strokes’ first album.”- Midtown Monthlyvia Facebook","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">The Soft White Sixties, one of San Francisco’s most talked about bands, have been hailed by some press as legitimate heirs to the Maximum R&B moniker placed on The Who some 40-plus years ago; and while that’s not un-true, The Soft White Sixties offer so much more.

Palm trees swaying gently in the balmy breeze? Scantily-clad bikini buxom babes rollerblading down an infinite slab of coral-colored concrete? How about anthemic, bombastic, life-affirming indie pop? If the latter didn’t occur to you, let us introduce you to Surfer Blood: they call West Palm Beach home and, while still in their early 20s, have penned “Astro Coast”, an album’s worth of catchy, summery indie songs that even the most hook-laden power pop band would rightfully be jealous of. Members JP (dubbed “The Mastermind” by the rest of the band), TJ and Thomas met one fateful night at an after party for Miami’s Ultra Festival, though they didn’t attend the festival itself (“We do not like the D’n’B,” they proclaim). After discussing music – what else? –for the remainder of the night, JP decided to recruit the other guys to perfect some songs he had been working on, and thus, the band was formed. Tyler and I had been playing with a few different people and nothing seemed to be working out. When Tom approached me at that party, he seemed dead serious about touring and trying to make the band work. I had seen how his previous bands had been; his old band had done a tour up to Atlanta over spring break when they were fifteen. It was exactly what Tyler and I needed. I gave him my phone number that night and he called me the next afternoon. He came by our rehearsal space and I showed him the recordings that would become “Astro Coast”. The fact that the other guys believed in the music from the very beginning was a huge catalyst”. From then on, things moved at a breakneck pace. A mere two months after they met they started touring outside of Florida in July, up to New York in August and then to Chicago in September. On a recommendation from a friend, they started recording “Astro Coast” at a studio in Port St. Lucie Florida, but when they only finished the drums at the end of a two day session, Tyler and JP decided to take matters into their own hands, spending the next six months tracking and mixing the record in JP’s apartment in Boca Raton with a copy of Pro Tools which Tyler procured for “dirt cheap” through a community college where he was studying in Orlando. JP asserts, “It gave us the opportunity to give our album the time and thought it deserved”. Their live shows started coming into their own as well, with the band practicing every day and touring nonstop, their newfound energy resulting in a constant evolution and refinement of their sound. “Our live set is always changing”, JP says. “Subtle things begin to work their way into the songs and before you know it people are coming up to you after shows and telling you that the live show is a completely different experience from the record”. The tipping point for the band, of course, was last year’s CMJ Music Marathon, where they played a whopping 13 shows in 7 days, catching the eye of the likes of Interview and The New York Times in the process. With the resultant excited chatter anointing them as the band to watch bar none, and a record deal freshly inked with Kanine Records, Surfer Blood released “Astro Coast”. In the following months “Astro Coast” attracted accolades across the board. The album and its songs landed atop numerous Best of Lists, including Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and Filter, with Bob Boilen from NPR declaring “…dig into Astro Coast and you’ll hear why, song for song, this may be my favorite album of 2010.”","<p>When you think of Palm Beach, Florida, what comes to mind?

It was nearly impossible to tour if you didn’t have access to some kind of personnel carrier, and making a record involved several years of tambourine overdubs. You know there were kids out there who just wanted to get in a van and play loud as hell through an Ampeg stack or a four-piece drum kit, but how could you call it a band if you didn’t even know a French horn player? By 2008, band membership had reached a critical mass. You’d go to a show and you might be the only person in the room who wasn’t playing an instrument. Hard times. Thankfully, there are always a few naturally resourceful people who refuse to be intimidated or excluded from making their own wild racket in public. Alex Edkins, Hayden Menzies and Chris Slorach have been around long enough to know that if you can’t fit it in the van, it’s not worth bringing. METZ play like one brutally heavy instrument with three heads, slashing heavy-gauge strings, bending guitar and bass necks in weird unison, along with what is probably the loudest drumming you’ve ever heard. It’s a return to everything that’s good about loud, ecstatic live music; a frantic nod to Nation of Ulysses, Shellac, The Pixies, The Jesus Lizard, and Public Image Ltd. at their most vicious, while still carving out some heavy new business. They play the instruments, the amps, and the room. Over the last three-and-a-half years, METZ have slayed in basements, skate shops, clubs, and festivals, sharing stages with Mission of Burma, Death from Above 1979, Archers of Loaf, Mudhoney, Oneida, Constantines, and NoMeansNo. I’ve seen a hundred jaws drop within the first four measures of their set. I once saw Alexander Hacke from Einstuerzende Neubauten approach Chris and rave about his bass tone. It’s a formidable task to try and capture such a powerful live band on record. Luckily, Graham Walsh (Holy Fuck) and Alexandre Bonenfant were more than up for it. Isolating the band in an old barn for a week with a portable recording rig, Walsh and Bonenfant were not only successful in documenting the unrelenting live force of the band, but they also managed to add some new and staggering sonic textures to the recording. Waves of organic feedback and fuzzed-out drones build the classic tension that eventually drops into each track’s relentless, dissonant pulse. And somehow, the raddest thing about it all is the songwriting. It’s not just riffs. It’s something that some heavy bands don’t get, but METZ do really well—and they do it collectively. It’s a hell of an experience, listening to this thing. With this, their debut album, METZ articulate with deafening clarity, what we’ve all known for some time: The world of good music needs a new power trio, and this is it.","<p>There was a time, in recent history, when you needed to have at least twelve members to even be considered a band in Canada.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/phosphorescent","Phosphorescent","Brooklyn, NY","","Nearly three years on from his breakthrough album Here’s To Taking It Easy, Phosphorescent returns to the fray with his most stunning record yet: Muchacho. During the last album’s ‘cycle’, one could almost hear jaws hitting the floor witnessing a live band of such infinite verve. Not only did the album draw high praise in the form of Mojo’s ‘Album of the Month’ (#8 End of Year), Sunday Times & The Independent ‘Albums of the Week’, hit Rough Trade’s Top 5 Best of the Year, but the band also supported The National over the course of three sold out nights at Brixton Academy, a show that The Independent gave 5/5 and called “a sublime, joyous gig”. Matthew Houck, for he is Phosphorescent, likes to work. The Alabama native, now resident in Brooklyn has delivered five albums as Phosphorescent since his 2003 debut. Houck has a highly distinctive artistic voice, but also a refreshing, rolled-sleeves approach to his expression, and if he had his way, he’d have twice as many albums under his belt by now. The singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer is envious of the time when prolificacy was expected. “In the ’60s and ’70s, they were making artists crank out records every six months. With guys like Waylon Jennings, John Prine and even Dylan, I don’t think those records would have gotten made in today’s climate, because now you’re allowed – or even required – to make a grand statement. I have this ideal – and I know it’s not possible, because of the way the industry works – of making a record every year.” Houck may not have managed that, but still has an impressive output – one born of commitment and his soul’s need to have its say. It was 2007’s Pride – a delicate and spare, haunted and haunting work of ragged country, bittersweet southern gospel and forlorn folk-ish drone – that first caused ears to swivel appreciatively in Phosphorescent’s direction. He followed it with To Willie, a tribute to country legend Willie Nelson, then 2010’s Here’s To Taking It Easy, an unapologetically enthusiastic plunge into country rock and rolling Americana. Now, his sixth album flashes yet another colour in the subtly shifting Phosphorescent spectrum. Muchacho reprises the understated melancholia and sensuous minimalism of Pride, while kicking up a little of Here’s To Taking It Easy’s dust, but it also strikes out into more adventurous waters via rhythm and electronic textures. It took shape if not quite by accident, then partly as a result of events beyond Houck’s control. After spending the best part of 18 months touring his last record, Houck was, in his words “pretty fried.” In late 2011, he returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard studio where he’d recorded his previous two albums, planning “on taking this whole thing down a few notches. I wanted to make music,” he explains, “but I was weary, so the spectre of putting anything out and getting back on the road was a bit of a block.” In December, he bought a load of old analogue gear and “just starting playing around with it, making these noises. They weren’t songs, they were just strange sound pieces. I’ve always had that element in my work, and one or two weird, ambient pieces seem to squeeze themselves onto every record, but suddenly I was doing a lot of those.” Houck also turned into a bit of DIY electrician, since a lot of the vintage gear needed fixing. “I ended up spending a lot of time learning about stuff like impedance matching and ohms,” he laughs. “I really got quite nerdy about how it all worked.” Houck also got very enthusiastic about the sonics that would eventually feed into the strikingly raw, Can-like, ‘Ride On/Right On’, where his simple, whooping vocal and 808 drum beats are the focus, the production is echo-heavy and the guitar little more than abstract background choogling. “I’ve always been happy with the records I’ve made,” the singer says, “but sonically, I think there’s been something lacking. This time, I was getting really excited about the experimental sounds I was making. I was thinking I might make an ambient record that had vocals, but no lyrics. I was actually considering releasing it under another name, or even my own name.” So, a much-needed break, plus some enjoyable messing around with noise, without much thought as to how to use it. But, exactly as 2012 turned, Houck’s life began to unravel. A domestic crisis meant he had to find another apartment/studio at short notice, in the dead of winter. In accommodation-squeezed New York. His life was falling apart, but almost perversely, “songs just started happening, and there were five or six of them.” Houck admits he was “in the middle of a bit of a freak-out,” so in the small hours one Sunday, he booked a ticket to Mexico, on a plane that was leaving three hours later. “It sounds really cheesy, but I went down there with a guitar and got a little hut on the beach in Tulum, on the Yucatan Peninsula.” He spent a week there, working to finish the songs that would become Muchacho, then went back to NYC, found a new place, fitted it out with his studio and began tracking the record in May 2012. ‘Muchacho’s Tune’ – with its opening braid of twanging guitars, piano and electric keys, its warm, rich reverb and poignant mariachi brass – is the song on which the album turns. “I’ve been fucked-up and I’ve been a fool,” confesses Houck, who may or may not be the feckless man-boy of the title. This was the first song to come to him fully formed, and it establishes the album’s lyrical theme – “that the possibility of redemption through love and romance is not just hopeful, it’s also viable. It definitely exists. But what ends up happening is more redemption through some vague means that I don’t really understand.” The album is perfectly framed by ‘Sun, Arise! (An Invocation, An Introduction)’ and ‘Sun’s Arising (A Koan, An Exit)’, the opening and closing tracks respectively. Sweet, healing and hugely potent in their hymnal simplicity, they not only recognise the diurnal rhythm that governs our existence, but also remind us that however dark things might get, the light will always reappear. ‘Muchacho’s Tune’, the somber and majestically slow ‘A New Anhedonia’ and the seductively loose ‘The Quotidian Beasts’ are the album’s fullest songs in terms of instrumentation and arrangements. Houck called on around 20 musicians at different times to add various parts, including members of the superior five-piece live band that has recently made such an eloquent and physically powerful contribution to Phosphorescent’s soulful expression. But the album’s composition and production are again all his own. “It’s really always me by myself, so much so that with Pride, no one else played anything. I have a group of really great dudes, and I’ll happily trumpet how fantastic these guys are, but a band going into the studio, as one? That never happens.” ‘A New Anhedonia’ – a gorgeous, charcoal grey song on which understated piano, soft brush work and ripples of pedal-steel guitar are matched with heavy reverb and gently sighing backing vocals – was the second song to come fully formed to Houck. And the crisis it describes was resolved by the very writing. Anhedonia is a loss of the ability to take pleasure in something the sufferer usually finds enjoyable, and Houck experienced it in those winter months following that grueling tour. It’s quite a shock to hear him murmur, “all the music is boring to me” and then describe music as “foreign”, but that’s how he felt for a short, dark while. “In addition to what was going on in my personal life, music had always been the most reliable thing for me, but I had a few really lost months of not caring about it, of not deriving any pleasure from music. I felt detached and adrift from everything. Oddly enough, I don’t think I knew the word ‘anhedonia’; it just kind of popped up right around the time of writing that song. That dread was still quite prevalent, even after the batch of songs came together.” If losing one’s way results in something as lustrous as the first album taster ‘Song for Zula’, more artists should find life’s maze and walk around for an indefinite period. It is such a glorious gem that unfolds with Houck’s cracked vocal stalking the perimeters unabashed. And this amidst an album positively riddled with highlights like ‘Terror in the Canyons’ and superlative ‘A Charm/A Blade’; all barreling piano and stabby horns galore. It’s indicative of Houck’s distinctive talent, dedication to his work and trust in his muse, then, that a temporary hurdle didn’t become a serious block. “I got clear of it by just getting to work on the recording,” he says, simply. Sleeves rolled. Resolve fixed. Muchacho delivered.","<p>Nearly three years on from his breakthrough album Here’s To Taking It Easy, Phosphorescent returns to the fray with his most stunning record yet: Muchacho. During the last album’s ‘cycle’, one could almost hear jaws hitting the floor witnessing a live band of such infinite verve. Not only did the album draw high praise in the form of Mojo’s ‘Album of the Month’ (#8 End of Year), Sunday Times & The Independent ‘Albums of the Week’, hit Rough Trade’s Top 5 Best of the Year, but the band also supported The National over the course of three sold out nights at Brixton Academy, a show that The Independent gave 5/5 and called “a sublime, joyous gig”.</p> <p>Matthew Houck, for he is Phosphorescent, likes to work. The Alabama native, now resident in Brooklyn has delivered five albums as Phosphorescent since his 2003 debut. Houck has a highly distinctive artistic voice, but also a refreshing, rolled-sleeves approach to his expression, and if he had his way, he’d have twice as many albums under his belt by now. The singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer is envious of the time when prolificacy was expected. “In the ’60s and ’70s, they were making artists crank out records every six months. With guys like Waylon Jennings, John Prine and even Dylan, I don’t think those records would have gotten made in today’s climate, because now you’re allowed – or even required – to make a grand statement. I have this ideal – and I know it’s not possible, because of the way the industry works – of making a record every year.”</p> <p>Houck may not have managed that, but still has an impressive output – one born of commitment and his soul’s need to have its say. It was 2007’s Pride – a delicate and spare, haunted and haunting work of ragged country, bittersweet southern gospel and forlorn folk-ish drone – that first caused ears to swivel appreciatively in Phosphorescent’s direction. He followed it with To Willie, a tribute to country legend Willie Nelson, then 2010’s Here’s To Taking It Easy, an unapologetically enthusiastic plunge into country rock and rolling Americana. Now, his sixth album flashes yet another colour in the subtly shifting Phosphorescent spectrum.</p> <p>Muchacho reprises the understated melancholia and sensuous minimalism of Pride, while kicking up a little of Here’s To Taking It Easy’s dust, but it also strikes out into more adventurous waters via rhythm and electronic textures. It took shape if not quite by accident, then partly as a result of events beyond Houck’s control. After spending the best part of 18 months touring his last record, Houck was, in his words “pretty fried.” In late 2011, he returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard studio where he’d recorded his previous two albums, planning “on taking this whole thing down a few notches. I wanted to make music,” he explains, “but I was weary, so the spectre of putting anything out and getting back on the road was a bit of a block.” In December, he bought a load of old analogue gear and “just starting playing around with it, making these noises. They weren’t songs, they were just strange sound pieces. I’ve always had that element in my work, and one or two weird, ambient pieces seem to squeeze themselves onto every record, but suddenly I was doing a lot of those.” Houck also turned into a bit of <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">DIY</span></span> electrician, since a lot of the vintage gear needed fixing. “I ended up spending a lot of time learning about stuff like impedance matching and ohms,” he laughs. “I really got quite nerdy about how it all worked.”</p> <p>Houck also got very enthusiastic about the sonics that would eventually feed into the strikingly raw, Can-like, ‘Ride On/Right On’, where his simple, whooping vocal and 808 drum beats are the focus, the production is echo-heavy and the guitar little more than abstract background choogling. “I’ve always been happy with the records I’ve made,” the singer says, “but sonically, I think there’s been something lacking. This time, I was getting really excited about the experimental sounds I was making. I was thinking I might make an ambient record that had vocals, but no lyrics. I was actually considering releasing it under another name, or even my own name.” So, a much-needed break, plus some enjoyable messing around with noise, without much thought as to how to use it. But, exactly as 2012 turned, Houck’s life began to unravel. A domestic crisis meant he had to find another apartment/studio at short notice, in the dead of winter. In accommodation-squeezed New York.

Nicki has filled a void in music with her brand of vintage-tinged rocking country soul — music that’s like an enchanting friend you’ve known for a short while but feels like you’ve known forever. In 2011 alone, Nicki has moved with grace and style from the studio to the main stages of the nation’s most revered music festivals (Outside Lands, High Sierra, Strawberry, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass), where her strong voice, striking presence and penchant for songcraft have made an undeniable impression and received rousing reception from audiences of all ages. Nicki’s story began at a New Year’s Eve party where she sang an Allman Brothers song, catching the attention of musician/producer Tim Bluhm (Mother Hips). With Tim’s encouragement, Nicki began to write her own songs and perform in public. The two fell in love and married, followed by the recording of Nicki’s debut album, Toby’s Song (2008), which was heralded as one of Jambase’s top ten albums of the year. Nicki’s music took on a life of its own with the formation of a band with childhood friend and lead guitarist Deren Ney. Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers grew with the addition of drummer Mike Curry (Jackpot), bassist/vocalist Steve Adams (ALO), and rhythm guitarist/vocalist Dave Mulligan. The band headed into the studio and emerged with Nicki’s sophomore album, Driftwood (2011), a collection of songs that evoke the AM magic of Linda Ronstadt, the honest charm of Johnny and June Cash’s duets, and the stoney sounds of retro Memphis soul. “Part Karen Carpenter and part Grace Slick, Bluhm’s voice moves effortlessly between softer, country tinged balladry and retro ‘60s/’70s rock,” No Depression declared.Since Driftwood’s release, Nicki has performed with her band, as a duo with her husband, as a vocalist for West Coast supergroup Brokedown in Bakersfield, and as the special guest of countless musical legends. She has been called on to share the stage with Chris Robinson, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Steve Kimock, Jackie Greene, Pegi Young and Josh Ritter; and has performed on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.” Nicki is currently touring and has a new album with Tim called Duets.There’s no question that Nicki Bluhm is the “It Girl” of San Francisco’s storied music scene. Luckily for us, the future is looking even brighter for rock’s rising star.","<div>Upon hearing the unique and refreshing sound of Nicki Bluhm, it becomes </div><div>immediately clear why she is in the midst of a breakout year.

Stirring and soulful, they blend syncopated bass lines and arpeggiated synth chords with live instrumentation and soaring vocals to create a sound that is both deeply moving, and sweetly captivating. With old heartbreak on the mountain style vocals, Bear Mountain sings with powerful release and vulnerable honesty. Bear Mountain began as the bedroom project of Ian Bevis. After releasing early demos and remixes online, Ian caught the ear of long-time friend and collaborator Kyle Statham. Together, the two friends brought the sounds to the stage by blending live instrumentation with dance style electronics. Their sound has been described as a mixture between Cut Copy and Passion Pit, infusing lead singer Ian Bevis’ vulnerable and emotive vocals. Says Ian Bevis, “We were trying to capture a feeling. When we wrote these songs we were just completely honest with ourselves, and I think that comes across in the music.” The debut album from Bear Mountain is titled “XO”, a collection of songs that is unmistakably fresh and powerfully captivating. From lush synth sounds and chopped vocal samples, to tropical drum beats and house drenched kicks, the album manages to capture the feeling of the infinite and the impossible, all rolled into one.","<p>Bear Mountain is an electronic dance band from Vancouver, B.C.

The band consists of four trained audio engineers who pay respect to conventional rock and roll and aren’t afraid to beg borrow or steal, consulting a smattering of western and surf music along the way. Pulling from the prog rock penchant of the 1960s, the band’s debut release, “The Perpetual Machine” is a satirical concept album. Fullbloods started putting together the album in mid-2009, slowly realizing they were forming a band. Since then a baby has been born, a move has been made, gear has been purchased, sessions have been booked, and countless hours have been spent thinking about what they’re trying to accomplish. And at the end of this particular journey, they decided they were trying to accomplish one thing: Making good music.","<p>Fullbloods is a rock and roll band – in the traditional sense – pulling inspiration from all corners and time periods of the genre.

When asked why The Nadas have persevered, Jason Walsmith singer, guitarist, co-founder says, ""We love it. And we're pretty pig headed."" The Nadas are rounded out by Justin Klein on drums and Jon Locker on bass. The Nadas have carved a thriving career out of what was once their college pastime, consistently filling clubs and colleges across the country selling more than 75,000 albums through their own Authentic Records. The Nadas' Listen through the Static is their fifth studio album and seventh overall. Listen through the Static is the second effort with producers Todd and Toby Pipes of Deep Blue Something and mixed by Grammy award winner Stuart Sikes (White Stripes, Loretta Lynn). ""We had such a great time working with the Pipes. We knew we wanted to do this record and with them as well."" Butterworth explains. ""We (Mike and Jason) wrote collaboratively most of the songs on Static,"" Walsmith adds. ""We hadn't written together that much in the past and wanted to try it. It worked well."" The collaboration on the album resulted in a more cohesive and straight ahead rock and roll record than past releases. Listen through the static is eleven new tracks featuring the title track which explodes into a chorus about today's struggle to find something palatable on the radio.

Miranda Dodson is one to remember.Miranda’s innovative folk winds through guitar strings, around vintage horns and forward-thinking synths, through wide-ranging-heart-filled vocals to turn listeners into believers. With lyrical images that reach right into the imagination, Miranda draws the listener into story and into sound. From impassioned alt-country ballads to fun head-bobbing folk-pop each track of her album “Change A Thing” stands strongly on its own but also hangs together united by collaborative creativity.With Producer Robert Harrison (Future Couds & Radar & Cotton Mather) at the helm & Lars Goransson (Alpha Rev, What Made Milwaukee Famous, The Solider Thread) sitting in as mix engineer and co-producer, this record is a true collection of artistry. A blend of folk-pop & alt-country, this record features some of Austin’s best musicians: George Reiff on bass (Jakob Dylan, Court Yard Hounds), Rick Richards on drums (Ray Wylie Hubbard), Joshua Zarbo on bass (Spoon, John Vanderslice), Derek Morris on piano (Alpha Rev)… and more! This strong rhythm section sets the foundations for a record that teams with quality & creativity… a perfect compliment to Dodson’s soaring vocals and down-to-earth lyrics.A native texan, Dodson makes her home in the “Live Music Capital of the World” – Austin, TX. While this is Miranda’s first concerted effort at releasing a full length record, Miranda has previously self-released three other recordings: “Cord of Three Strands”, “Miranda” & “Seriously”. Dodson has also been apart of several compilation albums including “Life Is Precious” (Wes King Tribute) & “Music For The City Vol. 1” – a compilation of Austin’s best artists benefiting Austin’s best local charities. This compilation also features: Alpha Rev, The Soldier Thread, Quiet Company, Brennen Leigh and more. Miranda was also featured is Austin’s First Night Parade, Miranda was invited to be 1 of only 3 music floats ringing in 2010 playing live with her band to over 50,000 Austinites. Dodson was also featured in Music For The City’s Hope For Haiti Benefit Concert that sold out The Parish and raised over $17,000 for Haiti’s orphans.Before moving to Austin Miranda spent much of her college career writing, recording and touring all over Texas and the Southern states, during this time she was invited to tour in Germany in 2002 and won 2nd place in the 2002 Duct Tape Songwriting contest, steadily gaining a solid fan base all along the way. After moving to Austin in 2007 Miranda began writing the material that would be “Change A Thing”. Producer Robert Harrison who is known for his innovative experimental rock was an interesting choice for the folk songstress, “While looking over my collection of songs” says Dodson, “…I knew that I needed a producer who was first and foremost an artist themselves to bring the full production of these songs to fruition…” Harrison’s experimental nature was a perfect match with Dodson’s hypnotic vocals and heartfelt delivery of her truth-filled lyrics.","<p><span style=""color: #4e4c4c; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;"">Pure & intimate…Miranda Dodson’s voice is like an old friend you haven’t seen in a while…familiar…refreshing & when you leave you think…“we should do this more often.” Her songs are simple and pure, Alt Folk with a progressive edge.

He ran into a friend from freshman year at CU, Will S. Buck Esq. who had interest in forming a band. After fifteen minutes of what felt like brothers meeting for the first time, Rooker and Buck discovered each others love for down home blues and dirty rock and roll, and a band practice was scheduled for later that evening. After a few practices and some spirited writing sessions the band started playing parties in the basement of Rooker’s house. Interestingly enough during the mass explosion of dj software and macbook pros, not many parties in Boulder featured live Rock & Roll bands at this point in time. The rock parties were a hit and the band began playing out at bars and local clubs for a small fee of beer and food. After adding Andrew “Monkey” Oakley on drums and Vincent “Funky” Ellwood on bass, The West Water Outlaws have managed to win the 2010 CU battle of the bands, and share the stage with national acts such as Rose Hill Drive, Dirty Sweet, The Swayback and Rival Sons. Using recording time won in the battle of the bands the Outlaws released their first official EP entitled “Crooked Angel”, recorded, mixed and mastered at Coupe Studios. In June of 2011 The Outlaws booked their first regional tour ever and piled into a black F250, later known as “Black Sabbath,” and headed south with only four total shows confirmed. West Water was an instant hit on their first stop in Memphis, Tennessee and was immediately offered another show the following night. By the end of the month, the band had played over twelve shows in four cities, and grown their fan base by 25%. There’s no telling what The Outlaws are cooking up next but it’s a guarantee that their shows will be high energy and rowdy both on and off the stage. This will be a band to watch as they strive to be the next big thing out of Boulder.","<p>The Outlaws were formed in early 2010 when singer Blake Rooker accidentally walked into the wrong statistics class, hazily.

Using recording time won in the battle of the bands the Outlaws released their first official EP entitled “Crooked Angel”, recorded, mixed and mastered at Coupe Studios.</p> <p>In June of 2011 The Outlaws booked their first regional tour ever and piled into a black F250, later known as “Black Sabbath,” and headed south with only four total shows confirmed. West Water was an instant hit on their first stop in Memphis, Tennessee and was immediately offered another show the following night. By the end of the month, the band had played over twelve shows in four cities, and grown their fan base by 25%. There’s no telling what The Outlaws are cooking up next but it’s a guarantee that their shows will be high energy and rowdy both on and off the stage. This will be a band to watch as they strive to be the next big thing out of Boulder.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/5454781/51b8b4251713486fda658fa49f76441b_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/JVdPxnClRxE?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

They decide to do it themselves- They form a band, they name themselves The Midgetmen, they book a show, they acquire some drink tickets, they release an album, they get some more drink tickets, they release a second album, they give away free fried chicken, they accumulate more drink tickets, they get better at writing songs, they book a tour of the midwest, they keep on writing songs, they almost win some Austin Music Awards, they find some drink tickets laying on the dirty floor of any number of bars, they release a third album, they play in the Northeast, they write more songs and keep getting free beer. They accidentally establish a Midgetmen ethos: do the absurd, but do it right, do it yourselves, and do it fun. If The Midgetmen operated their band like they do their day jobs, they might have given up long ago and just bought a few hundred six packs of Pabst Blue Ribbon at a convenience store. After all, those guitars and amps and pressing albums cost a lot more than all of those free beers together. Financially and emotionally, being in a band is not a great investment. But, if The Midgetmen had done that, would they have gotten to play with The Wrens, Titus Andronicus, Free Energy, Ezra Furman & The Harpoons, Franz Nicolay, Grant Hart and hundreds of other great bands? Would they have made countless friends and remained sane at their day job desks? Would they ever have gone to Abilene, Omaha, La Crosse, Morgantown, or College Station? Doubtful at best. The Midgetmen are an ever devolving work in progress, if progress is measured in inches and how far four friends can take an unhealthy hobby. Called Austin’s slop-punk mavens by a local writer, The Midgetmen just keep getting louder, fuzzier, and more fun… which is all the band has wanted to do since forming in 2002.

Focusing on the beauty rather than the volume of the song, the six-piece band creates a melodic landscape that layers a lush, early rock-and-roll vibe over spacey guitars and an atmospheric-sounding organ. Bonding over a mutual appreciation of old and new music alike—everything from Roy Orbison to Black Rebel Motorcycle Club—the Hounds Below have a sound that spans decades, yet is distinctively their own. Real Detroit columnist Jeff Milo describes the Hounds’ style as “presenting a swathe of moodier R&B, smoky soul, stately 50’s pop, and still maintaining that dreamy atmospheric fuzz rock sheen.” In the trenches of a post-divorce state of mind, Stollsteimer began writing dark, alluring ballads that would eventually give rise to the Hounds Below. With every reverberating note, the band captures the remorse and poetry behind lost love. But that’s not to say that all of their songs are lachrymose. A sizeable proportion of upbeat, danceable numbers complete the sound and provide for an energetic performance. Whether live or recorded, the Hounds Below will captivate and haunt all who listen.

The trio began playing around their hometown of Detroit shortly thereafter, around which time Trombley headed to California for what would come to be a three-year respite from the band and also the impetus for a revolving door of drummers, bassist and keyboard players. Undaunted, The Sights took to the studio and began recording their debut album, Are You Green?, at Jim Diamond’s Ghetto Recorders in Detroit. Originally released in June of 1999, Are You Green? was picked up by L.A.-based Fall of Rome Records and re-released the following year. Never big on rest, The Sights went to work on their sophomore album, Got What We Want (released in 2002). With this, the band’s freakishly precocious ability to blend frenetic garage rock, Motown and 60’s pop into something equal parts classic and catchy got them noticed. Got What We Want was released in the U.K. a year later, garnering them some very nice words from both the British press (""Got What We Want is a revelation – a treasure trove of sparky and wildly immediate songwriting."" -NME) and the not-so British press (""At last – a new Detroit-garage band that comes in colors."" —Rolling Stone). The Sights hit the road for a year of touring both countries, including a 10-week stint sleeping inside the group’s 1991 Ford Econoline van and stealing bagels for sustenance. In the spring of 2004, The Sights – now including Bobby Emmett as organist/bassist and Keith Fox as drummer – caught the ear of exSmashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, who signed them to his own Scratchie Records (an imprint of New Line Records). And with that, the band headed back to Ghetto Recorders to record their self-titled third LP, The Sights, due out in March 2005. No small feat, the album combines the unobtrusive honesty of The Band with slivers of influence from The Sights’ own personal record collections: Ike & Tina, Solomon Burke, Everly Brothers, Bob Seger, Tim Hardin and all manner of raucous songwriting. The end result is an album that’s classic, not derivative—filled with swagger and deference—and ridiculously catchy.

He picked it up, fell back in love and Team Spirit was born. Needing a band, he got in touch with his old shred-metal college roommate Roman Tobias Pettigrew (who had spent the last few years in Los Angeles starting a cult) and recruited Cosmo Kilburn Di Giulio after finding and nearly losing him after a night’s drinking in a country music bar. The line-up is rounded off by ball-kickin’ drummer Mike Addesso. Bursting with soulpower, Team Spirit’s music is a cocktail of Motown basslines, Thin Lizzy-esque duelling guitars, 90’s sing-along hooks, Glam beats and Chuck Berry feet. Do you like to rock?

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/david-wax-museum-","David Wax Museum","Boston, MA","indie, folk, country","Why do we need museums? They show us something familiar and traditional, while at the same time documenting our innovation, showing us possible directions for the future. This is the same reason we need David Wax Museum – to give us music that is somehow familiar, as if it has always existed somewhere in our cultural ether, but is at the same time undeniably fresh. Recently anointed as Boston’s Americana Artist of the Year (2010 Boston Music Awards), the David Wax Museum has been called “pure, irresistible joy” (Bob Boilen, NPR) and hailed by TIME.com for its “virtuosic musical skill and virtuous harmonies.” It is no surprise that its acclaimed performance at the 2010 Newport Folk Festival was hailed as one of highlights of the entire weekend by NPR. The Museum fuses traditional Mexican folk with American roots and indie rock to create an utterly unique Mexo-Americana aesthetic. Combining Latin rhythms, call-and-response hollering, and donkey jawbone rattling, they have electrified audiences across the country and are “kicking up a cloud of excitement with their high-energy border-crossing sensibility” (The New Yorker). The band’s new album, Everything Is Saved, produced by Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter), has been drawing rave reviews from all corners and has propelled the band into the national spotlight. With an illustration in The New Yorker, a feature in Paste Magazine, a Daytrotter session, a nod from TIME magazine as one of the top ten acts of this year’s South by Southwest, and an appearance on NPR’s World Café, the band has quickly become “one of the hottest new indie bands around” (Better TV). David Wax’s circuitous journey from mid-Missouri to the back roads of Mexico inspires the Museum’s blend of traditional Mexican and American folk music. While attending Deep Springs College, an unconventional school that doubles as a cattle ranch, David spent his summers working in rural Mexico with the American Friends Service Committee. He finished his degree at Harvard University before heading back to the Mexican countryside to study its rich folk music tradition on a year-long fellowship. It was there that he first began blending Midwestern folk with the instruments, rhythms, lyrical themes and song structures of son mexicano. Homeschooled by her father on a small farm in rural Virginia, Suz Slezak was reared on music — traditional Irish, classical, old time and folk. She graduated from Wellesley College, traveled around the world on a Watson Fellowship to study textiles, and then found herself back in Boston where she met David Wax, recently returned from his Mexican travels. He convinced her to track down a donkey jawbone, a traditional percussion instrument from Veracruz, and join his band. Suz is the Museum’s anchor to American roots music and helps fashion its distinctive sound with her fiddling and harmony vocals. Since 2007, David and Suz have formed the core of the Museum. The Museum is closely associated with many of the most innovative Americana bands active today, having toured nationally with The Avett Brothers and the Old 97’s and having shared bills with such acts as Carolina Chocolate Drops, Langhorne Slim, Ben Kweller, The Low Anthem, and Nathaniel Rateliff. Though the band is now packing clubs and theatres across the country and touring with national acts, David Wax Museum cut their teeth playing in living rooms and backyards throughout the country. In these unique settings, the band’s fiery and heart-wrenching shows created an undeniable buzz and a devoted following.","<p>Why do we need museums?

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/joe-fletcher","Joe Fletcher","Providence, RI","","Joe Fletcher & the Wrong Reasons is an Americana band that began in Providence, RI in 2005. In the center of this revolving cast of musicians, songwriter Joe Fletcher remains at the helm of this country blues-based outfit while still playing many solo acoustic shows throughout the land every year. Sometime in 2007, the band recorded their debut album BURY YOUR PROBLEMS at the rather mysterious Golden Monkey Studio in the heart of Providence’s Smith Hill neighborhood. Details of this event remain murky though it has been corroborated that sound experts Jay Berndt and Matt Oliva oversaw a assortment of musicians which included legends Jack Hanlon, Greg “J.D.” Burgess, Dennis Kelly, and Dale Cunningham. We do know that the record received overwhelmingly positive reviews and Fletcher’s story-driven songwriting began catching national attention earning comparisons to Cash, Cave, Cohen, and Dylan. After a series of lengthy U.S. tours in support of Bury Your Problems, Joe Fletcher & the Wrong Reasons released their sophomore effort WHITE LIGHTER in December 2010. This time they entered the illustrious Machines With Magnets Recording Studio in Pawtucket, R.I. with a cast that included local luminaries Scott Boutier, Jack Hanlon, John McCauley, Alec Redfearn, Damien Puerini, Dave Lamb, MorganEve Swain, Lily Costner, and Tyler Hayden. Following the recording of White Lighter, rhythm kings Dave Hemingway (drums) and Joe Principe (upright and electric bass) joined the organization, and guitar hero Damien Puerini stayed on in the lead role. White Lighter has attracted a whole new level of attention to the band. Most notably, No Depression has championed the band, saying that “Joe Fletcher proves his versatility on White Lighter. His signature brand of dark and lyrically driven honky tonk is interspersed with a softer side that would make Hagg or Jones proud.” Known best for their thrilling live show, Joe Fletcher & the Wrong Reasons have shared stages with many of their favorite acts including Deer Tick, Robert Earl Keen, The Low Anthem, Shooter Jennings, John Doe, The Supersuckers, Lydia Loveless, Murder by Death, Scott H. Biram, Holly Golightly, Slim Cessna’s Auto Club, Brown Bird, and The Devil Makes Three. Their wide variety of material and influences make them equally at home in a small café or a sold-out rock club.","<p>Joe Fletcher & the Wrong Reasons is an Americana band that began in Providence, RI in 2005.

And for that reason, their self-titled record (in two parts) plays much like a travelogue, a recollection of distant places that tend to mimic their own, somehow foreign, neighborhoods. Musically, The Eastern Sea combines swelling post-rock-like percussion, energetic and melodic bass guitar, lofty wurlizter, synthesizer pads, and finger-picked guitar that can either float above the ground or come down like a ton of bricks. As a band, The Eastern Sea tends to mimic their own musical aesthetic, sometimes swelling to a massive 11-piece collective featuring string and brass instruments, and sometimes simplifying down to the core players in the group: Tomas Garcia-Olano (Bass/Keys), Zach Duran (Percussion), Kevin Thomas (Trumpet/Percussion), and Matthew Hines (Guitar/Vocals/Keys) are the solid foundation on which the band is built. The sound and unique sense of place heard on The Eastern Sea’s two-part self-titled release also has much to do with the band’s unique recording and music writing process. Having just graduated from St. Edward’s University in Austin, Texas as valedictorian of his senior class, singer/guitarist/songwriter Matthew Hines has had to work, along with the other full-time students in the band, to create something special despite an often insane schedule. As the band continues to grow on a regional and national level, what 90.5 KUT, Austin’s nationally-renowned public radio, has said of the band certainly rings true. “Austin and the rest of the indie-pop world will be hearing a lot from this act for awhile.” Listen at Last.fm Watch videos of The Eastern Sea playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!","<div>At times, it is easy for The Eastern Sea to forget that Austin, Texas is home.

As the band continues to grow on a regional and national level, what 90.5 <span class=""caps"">KUT</span>, Austin’s nationally-renowned public radio, has said of the band certainly rings true. “Austin and the rest of the indie-pop world will be hearing a lot from this act for awhile.”</div> <p><a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Eastern+Sea"" target=""_blank"">Listen at Last.fm</a></p><p><br></p><p> <p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(33, 47, 64); background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;""><a href=""http://do512.com/event/2012/12/18/shiner-sessions-in-the-do512-lounge-the-eastern-seas-first-christmas-2"">Watch videos of The Eastern Sea playing a Shiner Beer Session at<br /> The Do512 Lounge! </a></span><span style=""font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Times""></span></p></p> <p></p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7782180/47f9ce16a01e915a0434ded6e2f784da_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/E4USmwynciA?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

T-Bird spent the summer of 2006 riding the rails from the hills of New England through New York and Philly to the California Coast. Along the way he jammed with Nashville backups, toured the hallowed grounds of Memphis, and (to hear him tell it) broke a heart or two in New Orleans. But it was a cock-eyed stroll down Sixth St. in Austin that had the biggest impact on the wandering songwriter. Through the din of reveling tourists and bar hopping college kids, T-Bird heard the unmistakable strains of some real blues. He walked into the bar and ended up sitting in with the band for a few tunes, thinking, “yeah, this is the place.” As good as his word – he was back a few months later, showing up with a slim roll of bills, a car full of vinyl, and very big plans for the city.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/flashbulb-fires","Flashbulb Fires","Denver","","Known for their distinctive brand of emotionally rich American indie-rock, Flashbulb Fires has a genuine conviction to push the boundaries of popular music. The Denver quartet’s knack for combining dynamic song structures with beautifully magnetic arrangements is instantly recognizable, while their live show is immediately captivating, blending polished artistry and raw electricity. With an energy akin to the Arcade Fire and lyrical sketches reminiscent of Pedro the Lion and The National, Flashbulb Fires’ music is both evocative and meticulously crafted. GLORY: In the age of the thin and disjointed digital single, Flashbulb Fires’ debut LP, Glory, is a cohesive artistic statement and an undeniable return to the album as an art form. In the winter of 2008, Flashbulb Fires took up residence in a modest house-turned-studio and began feverishly writing material, recording, and scoring parts for the album’s bold instrumentation. Interrupted only by a national tour, the enigmatic band emerged a year later with a record that was, without a doubt, a complete album in every sense of the word. Unquestionably stirring and impassioned, Glory abounds with lush orchestrations and powerful performances. From breathtaking horn arrangements to intimate acoustic guitars and inspired vocal harmonies, the album inhabits a deliberately divided and overwrought mood from start to finish. The brooding lyrical narratives, facilitated in large part by singer Patrick McGuire’s conflicted religious past and suburban-American upbringing, only further the album’s overall mood. After a childhood spent navigating through an unfulfilling revolving door of religions, McGuire eventually broke from his splintered youth and began to examine his spiritual struggle and suburban fatigue. Using images wrested from the sentiments of a bleeding generation, Glory relentlessly aches and trembles but is ultimately rooted in hope. It is in this hope that the album’s narrators are redeemed, at once detached and triumphant, while observing a society coated by a gauzy ignorance. Glory stands as a modern American album from a modern American band – complex and self-assured. Its haunting themes and dramatic sonic framework strike a compelling balance between the immediately accessible and the subtly profound.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-lindsey-obrien-band","The Lindsey O'Brien Band","Fort Collins, CO","","With an edge of daring and a tinge of heartbreak, Lindsey O’Brien Band (LOB)’s singular brand of soulful, high-energy rock & roll has been a staple of the Colorado music scene for more than six years.Their sound unites the drive of rock, the depth of folk, and the groove of soul—and throws in the get-up-and-dance of funk, a touch of jazz sophistication, and just enough pop to party to. It’s a full, layered sound that achieves no small feat: crowds both want to shout along and listen close—which is why they keep coming back for more. You couldn’t ask for more from a front woman—O’Brien has remarkable emotional and musical range, powerhouse vocals, and undeniable magnetism. Her voice easily brings crowds to their feet, but also has a singular lilt that gives the music a depth beyond its dance-ability. Scene Magazine describes O’Brien’s style as “sweet but not sugary… there’s a piquant, bluesy undertone in her voice….” Songs range from rowdy to slow burn, blending the attitude of O’Brien’s native Chicago with compelling emotional authenticity. This outfit has attitude in spades—and the chops to back it up. Articulate City describes them as “super fun and funky… featuring some of the finest talent in town.” Indeed, this is a super group formed by members of some of the most accomplished and well known bands in the area’s recent history—including The Atoll, Motorhome, and—yes—the Colorado State University Marching Band. Marching Band Director Dr. Christopher Nicholas, on trombone, and Dave Clapsaddle, on sax, inject songs with big-band energy and enthusiasm. With roots in the CSU music program himself, Matthew Mahern ups the rock quotient, adding a bold melodic layer on lead guitar. On bass, Craig Fowler anchors the LOB sound with deeply soulful, danceable grooves. Seasoned drummer Peter Knudson empowers the group’s compositions with driving rhythms tempered by a sophistication that draws from the jazz, blues, world groove, and other influences of his numerous musical projects. LOB has played some of the most acclaimed venues in Northern Colorado and has opened for internationally renowned bands The Fray and Heartless Bastards. A staple of the regional festival scene, they ignited FoCoMX 2011, bringing the entire standing-room-only crowd to its feet with their finale cover of Gloria. Also in 2011, they were featured on the main stage at Fort Collins’ Bohemian Nights at New West Fest, and were selected by Spokesbuzz to represent the best of the Fort Collins music scene on a compilation CD. In 2008, LOB released As Long As it Matters—a showcase of their outstanding range and musicianship. They’ve performed at Congress Theatre in Chicago; Soiled Dove Underground and Walnut Room in Denver; and The Budweiser Events Center, Mishawaka, and Aggie Theater in Northern Colorado, in addition to many more stage and radio performances.","<p>With an edge of daring and a tinge of heartbreak, Lindsey O’Brien Band (<span class=""caps"">LOB</span>)’s singular brand of soulful, high-energy rock & roll has been a staple of the Colorado music scene for more than six years.Their sound unites the drive of rock, the depth of folk, and the groove of soul—and throws in the get-up-and-dance of funk, a touch of jazz<br /> sophistication, and just enough pop to party to.

Comprised of Micah Schnabel (guitar/vocals), Shane Sweeney (bass/vocals), and Dustin Harigle (drums), the outfit, which plays more than 200 shows a year (and has for the past five years), has made their darkest, yet most rewarding record to date, writing songs that deal with the problems and dilemmas of growing up, coming to terms with ones dreams versus reality, as well as songs about the current state of the union and our political atmosphere, parades that end in death, and navigating the troubled waters of relationships. One song in particular that sums up the inner turbulence and confusion of being in a touring rock ‘n’ roll band while your friends all buy houses, get married, and start families, is ""No Shame"", a song in which Schnabel describes both the curse and pleasure of playing rock ‘n’ roll: ""There’s a guitar, that’s leaning on my wall, the instrument of my ultimate downfall. And notebooks scattered all over my floor. Six hundred pages all filled with regrets, and hundreds of songs that ain’t finished yet. And a job application getting harder to ignore."" But, as Sweeny puts it, describing a time when he ""questioned whether or not I wanted to be in Two Cow anymore. I was very angry. I really just wanted to explode but at the same time I was so incredibly disappointed I wanted to hide away and just give up."" Two Cow Garage’s solution when faced with problems like these, as Sweeney tells me is, ""Seeing as how neither one of those would have been very reasonable I wrote a song about it."" When down, questioning the band, or questioning themselves, each member of Two Cow Garage turns to the one thing they know, music, and it pulls them through. Enter ""III"", a record that has recharged and renewed the members of Two Cow Garage’s momentum, as they once again hit the road, even prior to the album’s April release date, gearing up to put a hundred thousand more miles on the van this year, and play 200 plus more shows at smoky bars.

Drawing heavily from a set of musical heroes that included Guided by Voices and the wistful Elephant Six Collective, they worked to set themselves apart in the crowded NYC music scene. Their debut EP met with critical acclaim, described as ""a taught example of why [bridges and powerlines] should be added to your list of bands to watch."" (IGN.com) The success of the EP attracted producer Chris Zane, who had helmed recent breakout records by Les Savy Fav, White Rabbits and Asobi Seksu. The band spent much of 2007 writing and recording while further developing their sound into equal parts nineties-styled indie-rock, psych-influenced harmony and analog synth intricacy. The band closed 2007 with a successful East Coast tour, a sold-out show at NYC’s Mercury Lounge with Margot and the Nuclear So and So’s and a showcase at the CMJ Music Marathon. They will release their new record ""Ghost Types"" on their own imprint Citybird Records in April of 2008.

Her voice and talent have been heard across the states and overseas in festivals such as CMJ2011 and opening for acts such as VV Brown. Her innovation as a singer-songwriter echoes rich vocals with a haunting infusion of Folk and R&B. Committed and driven, Christina draws her inspiration through one simple and profound act- creating excellent music. As a result of her passion and experience, Christina has expanded her expertise by creating “L Rock the Party Booking.” L Rock the Party Booking is an NYC based company dedicated to live performance and recorded music through musicians committed to creating art in their music. Whether on stage singing, or as a business woman, Christina continues to be an element of opportunity and possibility in today’s Music Industry.Christina LaRocca grew up under her mother’s musical influence, hoping to one day to sing as beautifully as her. With the record player constantly spinning Stevie Wonder, Natalie Cole, and Aretha Franklin and it’s easy to see where Christina got her soulful and smooth sound. After moving from Brooklyn to Staten Island, during her teen years Christina found herself listening to listening to female radio stars like No Doubt, TLC, Fiona Apple, Alanis Morsette, and Lauryn Hill. She started auditioning for plays and realizing theatre wasn’t satisfying her musical impulse, she picked up a guitar and following her father’s beatnik poetic ways, dug into the deep dark mass throbbing inside her heart and began writing her own music. By 2005 Christina had caught the ears of local musicians such as Carl Gallagher and Dorian Lake. After jamming at a hurricane Katrina fund-raiser, they decided to name their newly found project Heavy Weather. Christina LaRocca & Heavy Weather released “Miles of Mud” in 2008, which has been receiving attention internationally since. Christina was a part of 101.9 RXP’s Record Store Day in April 2010 and was placed on Rich Russo’s Anything Anything Vinyl Compilation Record and came into #69 on records sold in NY.

The mystery is revealed: ‘A New Kind Of Something’ is the first single from the ‘Common Mama’ project by Ferdinando Arnò and the singer for this track is Jon Kenzie. Jon Kenzie is a young British artist with an extraordinary voice – both fresh and evocative, original and yet familiar – which seems to emerge from memory and give it a new direction. Jon began his career playing around London and is now the lead of the group Beggar Joe on the Manchester indie scene. ‘A New Kind Of Something’ was inspired by the final scene of the 1971 cult film ‘Harold and Maude’ by Hal Ashby, where the young lead wanders into the vista of a British mountain landscape playing a banjo, towards the encounter with something new and undefined. In the film, the piece accompanying this scene is by Cat Stevens. Mixing that atmosphere, the banjo sound and a piano solo inspired by The Mamas & The Papas, Arnò composed the song with the voice of Jon Kenzie in mind, a voice with the best colours of 70’s Britpop blues, a hippy crooner with contemporary spirit and gusto… it’s enough to listen to artists like Cloud Control, Feist, and Ray Lamontagne. Recorded between Manchester, Milan and London, the song was mixed at Metropolis Studios in the U.K.’s capital by Tom Elmhirst (Amy Winehouse, Adele, Cee Lo Green…).","<p>Many people around the world, listening to ‘A New Kind Of Something’ in the TV advertising campaign for the worldwide launch of a new tablet PC, have asked themselves (and asked also via the Internet) who wrote it and who sings it, because the song’s lyrics, and the way they are sung, are somehow both immediate and comforting.</p> <p>The mystery is revealed: ‘A New Kind Of Something’ is the first single from the ‘Common Mama’ project by Ferdinando Arnò and the singer for this track is Jon Kenzie.</p> <p>Jon Kenzie is a young British artist with an extraordinary voice – both fresh and evocative, original and yet familiar – which seems to emerge from memory and give it a new direction. <br /> Jon began his career playing around London and is now the lead of the group Beggar Joe on the Manchester indie scene.</p> <p>‘A New Kind Of Something’ was inspired by the final scene of the 1971 cult film ‘Harold and Maude’ by Hal Ashby, where the young lead wanders into the vista of a British mountain landscape playing a banjo, towards the encounter with something new and undefined.

This hard hitting four piece has set fire, stage after stage, including blowing up the second stage at the Kiss/Aerosmith, 2003 concert and have got down with Sir Mix a Lot in 2005 for a New Years Eve bash. After only five weeks on Clearchannel, owned KFNK Funky Monkey 1049.fm The Outfit had released their first official album, ""Be Explicit"". The songs on the album are filled with powerful lyrics from vocalist Michael Dubois, whom is a self coached singer/rapper/lyricist who delivers a pulse pounding stage performance. This bands self-expression pours out as a mix of rock, funk and hip hop. Mike(singer/lyricist) is from Seattle Wa., whom had found a love for poetry and singing in a Pentecostal church. Mike has a natural ability to amp up any crowd and has amazing stage presence. When listening to The Outfit one won't hear a drawn out, screechy guitar solo, only a smooth, clean, sound, laid down by none other than, guitarist Casey Shirks. Casey is a Tacoma native who has been jamming on the guitar since the he was in the third grade. He has an ear for perfection and an everlasting desire to bring a new sound to the table. Casey has an extreme amount of talent that is portrayed every time he is entertaining a crowd. Providing the beats is Robbie Armijo. He's a Burien native and has been playing the drums since he was 5. He's a very versitle type of drummer and has been in several other local area bands and a long time studio/session drummer. He's back in The Outfit and ready to rock the show. Announcing the newest member of THE OUTFIT- Chris on bass! Formerly of Seattle band Viscid. More info to come…….

In February 2012, they spent an entire day—sunrise to sunset—on Ocean Beach in San Francisco filming a music video in a single continuous take. With a very limited budget, they produced, directed, and released the video on YouTube (youtu.be/boGyFAYomBo). It went viral.Wildlife Control released their self-titled debut album on July 31, 2012.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/nimo-the-hooligan","Nimo The Hooligan","Minneapolis","","I have been a DJ/Turntablist since I was 14, started playing house parties and barbeques for friends and it only went on from there. Graduating to my first live performance in local venues like the, now deceased, Dinkytowner, Red Sea, Blue Nile, and the also now deceased, Urban Wild life. After highschool I immediately began college at The Institute of Production and Recording, this didn’t turn out well as I ended up dropping out after only one year to work, save, etc. But the vinyl never stopped spinning through all of it. Not long after leaving IPR I began delving deep into the local scene, meeting people and networking, getting on mixtapes and albums and sitting in at shows or open mics as often as possible. Also along the way, recording a great deal of original music, collaborating with my many music friends, and generally trying to find a semi permanent outlet in the form of one genre of music or another. This also proved to not work out well, as i have, and still do, play with many different genres of music. I also work independently as a Wedding and Event DJ which is a direction I would like to continue going in just for side work. I like to think that i have a Bruce Lee way of going about my musical endeavors, “The style of no style. Flow like water”. I simply wish to push the envelope, as many other DJ/Turntablists are doing, of the acceptable mediums for DJs and Turntablists in general. As of the last 5+ years, I have stayed busy with my friend and collaborator Nobuddie, playing hundreds of shows and recording equally as many tracks, waiting for the right time and material to release to the public. My other main project, is arguably, the funkiest super-group in the Twin Cities, P.B. & The Jam. Having been a band for less than 2 years, we have accomplished much, played much, written much, and have garnered a bunch of acclaim because of it all. I have also been featured on a revolutionary video game called Jam Party, in which the player gets to create/arrange/perform music from local and national artists (soon to be available on PC, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, Playstation 3, Iphones, and Androids). I have been blessed with great, talented friends… We as a state are blessed with an ever blossoming music and art community, which in turn blesses the individual artists and the fans for having a healthy, active music scene that attracts live acts from around the country and the world. I have had the blessing of being able to open/perform with many of my personal heros and influences, such as: Method Man/Redman Eyedea & Abilities POS of Doom Tree Prof/Fundo Joell Ortiz Tech N9ne D-12 DJ Logic Mr. Dibbs St. Paul Slim Bone Thugs n’ Harmony Wookiefoot Heatbox House of Pain/Everlast Cunninlynguists Greives Mac Lethal George Clinton/Parliment Soulcrate The Crest King Sandman Just to name a few… I have been able to meet alot of people, go alot of places, and do alot of amazing things. None of this mentions the amazing people that i have the pleasure and joy of performing with on a regular basis in the Twin Cities… big shout outs go to: Out of Bounds, Fill in The Breaks crew, Hecatomb, Stophouse, The Background Noize Crew, Option 2, Wide Eyes, Moonlight Grammar, Mercies May, Desdamona, Big Jess & Unknown Prophets, More than Lights, Bottom Feeders, New Reb, Jon Wayne & The Payne, Root City Band, and too many others to name.","<p>I have been a DJ/Turntablist since I was 14, started playing house parties and barbeques for friends and it only went on from there.

Potent Tai’s music is unswayed by mainstream hip hop and reinvents the essence of it’s origin. His music remains untainted by repetitive licks about flashy cars or easy women but rather touches on current real life issues while still keeping his music real. “I’m not into a lot of music that’s out, it’s too watered down and repetitive. everyone wants to talk about the same things…i like artists that aren’t afraid to step out of the box and talk about all types of things”, speaks Tai of his own style. With already having experience with performing in front of up to several thousand people at a time, Tai demands an audiences attention while on stage, not lacking stage presence in the least. “I’ve performed in front of label’s, producers and talent shows…” He remarks about some of his experiences. His goals are to leave a permanent mark on hip-hop history and not fall into the trap of becoming just another “one hit wonder” as many of today’s mass-produced, generic artists do. There is no doubt that if Potent Tai and the Jersey Devilz continue on the same path, their music will forever be respected and the artist “Potent Tai” will become a household name. respected and the artist “Potent Tai” will become a household name.","<p>Potent started of as a shy kid, growing up in the heart of Newark, New Jersey also known as “Brick City”. <br /> Growing up in the peak of Hip hop’s emergence into mainstream music, the early 1990’s produced some of Jay’s biggest influences which helped him create his own style. “I remember when I first heard ‘Juicy’.

While all are very positive elements to a successful career, he understands that the road ahead is long and paved with uncertainties that will test his strength and ambition. “If we don’t struggle with things, then they are not worth it sometimes. If something is handed to you, you might not appreciate it,” he says. Black’s music continues to grow and evolve while other artists can be doomed to one genre for their entire career. Jon Black’s musical voice represents a choir of personalities and emotions Micah Dalton: “He may sound like an earthier, cleverer Ben Harper, but musically Dalton suggests mid-’80s Prince in the way he defiantly straddles so many styles, requiring an enormous musical arsenal to get his point across. These juxtapositions of sounds and style rarely feel forced or even deliberate, courtesy of Dalton’s soulful vocals and incisive songwriting.”- PASTE MAGAZINE Dalton began erecting signposts to chart the course of his musical progression back in 2004 with his pop-inflected full-length debut, These Are the Roots. Next came 2006’s seven-song Advancement EP, which displayed moments of kinship with Donny Hathaway and Marvin Gaye, but was anything but an exercise in imitation. In countless clubs, theatres, coffeehouses and colleges east of the Mississippi, Dalton has shared the stage with the likes of Jon McLaughlin, Mindy Smith, Gary Jules, Dave Barnes and other lesser-known but no less talented folks. In 2007 he also signed on with unique Athens-based nonprofit indie Rebuilt Records. The momentum is continually building.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/audien","Audien","","","In the middle of a global explosion of Electronic Dance Music, a genre that thrives in the most exclusive nightclubs of the world’s cosmopolitan cities, a prodigious producer has emerged from the unlikeliest of places. The small seaport town of Mystic, Connecticut, has been the home of Audien (AKA Nate Rathbun) for his entire life, and it’s in a small apartment in Mystic where Audien began creating music in 2008. Using a very basic set up, and a secret cocktail of plug-ins, Audien worked diligently to hone his craft. By age 17, while his friends were either preparing college applications or teeing up jobs, Audien began to test the waters by sending his unsolicited music out to producers, labels & bloggers. Though confident in his sound, Audien carefully managed his expectations, suspecting it was unlikely that he’d hear back from a random demo submission. An enthusiastic response came, however, from Flashover Recordings, the trance label owned by beloved Dutch Producer/DJ Ferry Corsten. Audien’s single “Rise & Shine” was released, and soon thereafter he was off to the races.Over the next two years a slew of renowned labels came calling, gravitating to Audien’s stunning melodies & innovative sonic landscapes. Audien worked meticulously, but prolifically, churning out anthems & remixes for labels including Enhanced, Perceptive, Armada, Black Hole, Nervous, with tracks routinely charting on Beatport. Audien’s tracks also began to appear on compilations assembled by some of the genre’s giants, including Corsten’s Countdown, Tiesto’s Club Life, Above & Beyond’s Trance Around The World, and Armin Van Buuren’s A State of Trance. A particularly exciting opportunity presented itself in May of 2011, when Audien had the opportunity to open for Van Buuren at New York’s Roseland. In just 3 years, Audien had gone from idolizing Van Buuren to sharing a stage with him. As Audien has continued to release tracks into 2012, his music has evolved to include elements of Progressive House. The monster 2012 release These Are The Days was lauded by influential blog Dancing Astronaut as a “catchy summer anthem,” while The Top Sound noted “the combination of flawless evolution, beautiful piano chords, & trance-y plucks makes this an absolutely brilliant track.” Never straying far from his roots, Audien released his highly acclaimed songEventide on Anjunabeats in August of 2012. Audien’s relationship with Above & Beyond continued to blossom through the fall; in November, A&B premiered Audien’s track Wayfarer as the first ever song played on their new radio show, Above & Beyond Group Therapy. Elsewhere in November 2012, Audien released the incendiary progressive house track SUP, via Trice Recordings. SUP was featured by Dutch icon Hardwell on episode 87 of Hardwell On Air. Commenting on the track, Elektro magazine declared, “… this production takes its listeners on a roller coaster ride of uplifting synth progressions, chaotic builds, and hard, bouncing drops that holds the ability to move crowds wherever this banger is played.” Shortly after the track’s release, Audien joined Hardwell on tour for dates in New York & Boston. With his ability to create fresh tracks in auto-pilot, Audien has turned his attention to performing live, a craft he takes just a seriously as his production. Audien recently performed at some of the hottest clubs in the US including L.A.’s Exchange & Lure, San Francisco’s Ruby Skye & Harlot, New York’s Pacha, XS in Las Vegas, and Miami’s LIV. With more big shows forthcoming, Audien is ready to continue his rapid rise out of Mystic, and around the world.

She released her third album, Wound & Will, on March 5, 2011, under the moniker Little Brave. To celebrate the release of the album, Stephanie decided to create an event unlike any other. She called it “Wound & Will: The Musical.” Each song had a theme, i.e. a ballerina on “The Invitation”; puppets on “Blame”; everyone wearing band uniforms on “Time To Forget.” She also recorded 9 transition tracks, which played while the stage was reset for each new song. The San Antonio Current said, “This was easily the best show I’ve seen so far this year, and it wasn’t about the confetti: it was about the songs and the vision of a top-notch all-around artist the regional music scene should be proud of.” She is currently organizing the “musical” for a second showing in Austin, TX.If you are enjoying the recordings, you’d be happy to know that Stephanie also PRODUCES her own albums.

Originally founded by lead singer and songwriter Anthony Watkins II, later joined by classically-trained bassist Tim Shelburne, Jr., and finally rounded out by the metronomic precision of drummer Darryl Schomberg II, Mobley deals in a brand of pop/rock that is fresh, catchy, and melodic. Relying on songwriting rooted in pop sensibilities, multi-instrumentalism, and a vibrant live show, they make music that is interesting, accessible, and memorable.Perhaps as a result of Watkins’ upbringing as the son of an itinerant military man, Mobley’s sound is all over the map. Never ones to tread a single path, their genre-hopping songs run the gamut from stunningly dense to disarmingly sparse; from danceable pop to piano rock beneath bubbling synths; from horn-laced swing to flourishes of folk and alt-country; from soaring orchestral epics to moody pulses with angular guitar hooks. Regardless of how you categorize it, their sonic versatility, musical tightness, and cutting-edge multimedia/light show make them a must-see live act.","<p>After going through several rounds of reinvention, Mobley took its current shape during the summer of 2008.

In the last year, My Body Sings Electric has released a full length album “Changing Color” to a sold-out hometown crowd, recorded their single “Step Into The Light” at the legendary Blasting Room (Rise Against, Less Than Jake), earned consistent local radio play, and gained state-wide recognition as they placed in the top 3 during KTCL 93.3’s “Hometown for the Holidays” competition. In winter of 2010, the band traveled to Portland, OR to record their debut album at Interlace Audio (Dance Gavin Dance, Johnny Craig, Fear Before). The investment has paid off as the band has played to packed houses since the album release.

The band’s star seems to be continually on the rise, as they play premiere Manhattan and Brooklyn venues and release their fully-Kickstarter-funded LP, Maple Ridge, only a year after their formation.Swear & Shake is Kari Spieler (vocals, lyrics, guitar), Adam McHeffey (vocals, lyrics, guitar, banjo, piano), Shaun Savage (electric bass), and Tom Elefante (percussion). The band formed in 2010 after Kari helped Adam record a demo one of his original songs, “Johnnie.” From that moment, they knew they were on to something good. Adam recruited longtime friends Shaun and Tom to flesh out the sounds behind Kari’s soulful, smoky voice and Adam’s catchy folk strumming.The band was a hit from their first release in November 2010, a five track album aptly titled “Extended Play,” which received over 200,000 Creative Commons downloads in North American and Europe. In the first few months, favorite tunes like “Johnnie” and “Bones” started to pop up in covers on YouTube.Newsday praised the band, comparing them to indie darlings Mumford & Sons and Bon Iver. New York’s The Deli described front lady Kari’s pipes as “gorgeously full,” and Brooklyn Belles compared her to “a young June Carter Cash."" David Malachowski of the Daily Freeman made clear that Swear and Shake is more than fun sounds and pretty faces. “A haunting postcard from a faraway, warmer place, Spieler’s moving, heartfelt delivery takes this to a higher place,” writes Malachowski. “Daring and direct, Swear & Shake points a finger at you, and you can’t help but respond. Well done.” Frost Click called the band’s EP a “treat” and writes, “There’s no denying the fact that Swear and Shake know how to make amazing sounds. The quartet has a knack for creating a wonderful balance of emotion, instruments, vocals and lyrics; making you want to listen more and more.”Writing about their appearance at B.O.M.B. Fest opening for Weezer and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Connecticut’s Culture Cache called their sound, “expansive, majestic, harmony-heavy,” and music blog The Indie Kollection wrote, “Musical discoveries like these make me want to move to NY.” Luckily, there’s still time to make the move considering blog The Feast called them “a mainstay on the New York scene.”Despite the band’s critical acclaim, attending a Swear & Shake show feels like a cozy, crowded room of old friends where a guitar is picked up as the last bottle is poured. Shows at New York institutions like The Living Room, Pete’s Candy Store, The Knitting Factory, Arlene’s Grocery, and the Bitter End have been raucous and full of laughter and dancing. Music blog Sounds That Matter, who had the band record a video for their site testified, “It took me one day to realize I was head over heels for this band.”Using the crowd-funding site, Kickstarter, the band raised $5,250 ($750 over their goal) from over 100 individual donations to make their latest independent record. Swear and Shake used various social media outlets and endearing quirky video updates to get the word out about their Kickstarter campaign (and released a super adorable impromptu celebratory dance video when they reached their goal). Recording was finished in the early fall and the album, including recent fan favorites like “These White Walls,” “Marbles,” and “Wrecking Ball,” will be available in early 2012.","<div>In a city that offers endless new sounds, New York-based band Swear & Shake’s loyal fan base and earnest talent have driven them on tours across the US and into the focal point of fawning critics.

Songs like the raucous “Wild” with its vibrantly chanted chorus will undoubtedly keep playing in your head long after the song is over. Equally as unforgettable is the reinvention of the hauntingly lovely “Heartbeats” by The Knife.

Inspired by the magnetism of San Francisco, the grind of Los Angeles and the serenity of the Big Sur Coast, their songs are a joyous revival of rock n’ roll, a twisting indie-folk dance and a heartfelt protest ballad.

Part 60’s Laurel Canyon, part 70’s Venice Beach and part 10’s Silverlake, the band and the harmonies are held together by their message of universal love, peace and the belief that the highest form of consciousness is achieved by togetherness and unity. Uplifting, collaborative, joyous and communal, their songs are a walk through their life thus far: Meeting each other (“Hi Hey There Hello”), experiencing together (“San Francisco”, “The Great Divide”, “I’ve Been Around”), fighting and making up (“Colin’s Song”), emerging stronger (“Carry Your Will”, “We Are Free”) – their message is finding a foothold with fans from every walk of life, bringing people together under one roof to celebrate each other.","<p>5 childhood friends from the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, augmented by 3 mid-western transplants, The Mowgli’s are a quintessential California band.

Perhaps Popmatters described it best: “Dana Falconberry and her musicians have created something utterly magnificent with Leelanau….An exceptional, unique take on orchestral folk that’s full of heart, beauty and nature.”As intricate and delicate as the recordings are, Dana’s backing band has done an amazing job pulling these songs off in a live setting, and if you are on Dana’s route, be sure to check a show out.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/jbm","JBM","Montreal, Canada","indie, singer-songwriter, folk","Despite feeling disillusioned, drained, and disconnected after an intense year of touring, Brooklyn-based recording artist Jesse Marchant, a.k.a. JBM, felt an insatiable need quietly gestating. After a much needed break, he relocated to a remote cabin in the Catskills and started the long process of writing and recording Stray Ashes, his followup to 2010’s Not Even in July. Like a twilight journey through canyons, with noctilucent clouds on the horizon, these songs flow with refined grace and raw force. Rather than starting with an acoustic guitar and vocals, Marchant experimented with drums and loops of electric guitar melodies. As the winter progressed, he continued this process until the song structures emerged. To record he relocated to a large log house next to a frozen lake inhabited by hundreds of geese in upstate New York. Despite the din of geese fighting outside, and being attacked by one particular goose on more than one occasion, he managed to record everything but the vocals. He then moved to the city temporarily where he wandered the streets listening to the instrumentals and writing lyrics. Next, John Congleton joined the project for additional recording and mixing. Congleton’s contributions help to define a sonic space throughout Stray Ashes that perfectly cradles Jesse’s earnest vocals, as do the additional performances of McKenzie Smith (of Midlake, Drums), and Macey Taylor (of A.A. Bondy, Bass) on several tracks, which were recorded by Congleton in his Texas studio. The gauzy sonic blanket Marchant and Congleton have created provides a foundation for the mysterious collection of songs on Stray Ashes. We don’t have to fully understand them to be moved by these shining beacons guiding us through a mellifluous fog. Propelled by Marchant’s voice, songs like “Winter Ghosts” and “Keeping Up” seem to effortlessly fill the room with an addictive somber haze, while Marchant seems to implore us to return to something true and meaningful on other standouts like “Ferry” and “Only Now.”","<p>Despite feeling disillusioned, drained, and disconnected after an intense year of touring, Brooklyn-based recording artist Jesse Marchant, a.k.a. <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">JBM</span></span>, felt an insatiable need quietly gestating.

His new album, The Trouble With People, marries the margin between timeless and modern with an organic sound rich in emotion and intellect. Raised on the music of Joni Mitchell, Martin Sexton, and Jeff Buckley, it is Glier’s brother who he notes as his greatest influence. “My brother is autistic and non-verbal. I learned to communicate with words better once I realized how to communicate to someone with out them.” Glier’s impressive growth as an artist is apparent from the very first opening chords of the albums title track. With honesty as his weapon, Glier fires lyrics that draw you in right before a sudden burst of sound, where his enrapturing voice calmly commands over sweeping orchestral strings. Throughout the 12 new tunes arise musical surprises, from the train like, stirring style of “Someone Else To Crown” to the vinyl Beatlesque sound of “Naia” to the thrilling and intimate moments captured on “Julie’s Song” and “Reply.” At all times, it is Glier’s voice, with its low earthy rumble and fluttering falsetto, that has critics, and musicians alike, singing his praises. Sharing the stage and touring with the likes of John Mayer, Ellis Paul, Cheryl Wheeler, Peter Mulvey, Tim Reynolds, Erin McKeown, Jonathan Edwards, Mark Erelli, and Livingston Taylor, Glier’s accomplishments far surpass his age. “Glier takes his audience to a place that is unknown without his intoxicating groove,” wrote Performer Magazine. His debut record, WHY, pre-sold out of its first pressing three weeks before its’ official release. The Vineyard Times calls him, “a star in the making.” He has performed hundreds of shows throughout the east coast including three sold-out nights at the Iron Horse Music Hall in Northampton Mass, and performing for more than 25,000 people on the National Mall in Washington D.C. Livingston Taylor says, “Listening to Seth’s music gives me hope for what’s to come. The next generation is alive and well.” Beginning as an act of solitary creation, “The Trouble With People” was recorded in Glier’s basement during the course of three months. In the comfort of his own home and without the restraint of being on the clock, Glier patiently treated each song like a scene in a movie. “I felt as though I was collecting footage for a film rather than recording a record,” recalls Glier. After carefully assembling a cast of sounds and instruments, Glier and co-producer Ryan Hommel signed on Alan Evans (Soulive) to mix and master while enlisting him to play Drums on several numbers. The result is a brilliant show of expansive songs elegantly matched with lush arrangements all the while retaining an intense level of intimacy. The Trouble With People marks Glier’s evolution from emerging artist into a sophisticated musician and songwriter. Equipped with a keen observation of the human condition, Glier’s lyrics are thoughtful and seem to amplify the cry of the ordinary heart. His infectious passion and energy transcend his live shows and leave listeners talking for days after his performance. Simply put by CD Baby, ""When it comes down to Seth’s music, either you love it or you’ve never heard it before.” Listen at Last.fm","<p>20 year-old singer, songwriter, and pianist, Seth Glier has come a long way from singing the national anthem at his Little League baseball games.

Hoop learned to sing at an early age, harmonising with her musical Mormon family in northern California. She began writing highly idiosyncratic songs at the age of 14 to keep her company on her long walks to school. At 16, Hoop broke away from her strict upbringing and began what she calls her ‘life as a racoon’, off the grid & close to nature. Rambling through the high mountain deserts of the Southwest and along the coastlines of the Northwest, she worked as a wilderness survival guide and chalked up skills in farming, surveying, and carpentry. Her songwriting continued throughout, shared on porches, in deep river canyons and around campfires. In 2004 the desire to share these songs on a broader scale set in. She settled in Los Angeles, where she honed her songwriting craft and developed a reputation as a unique and beguiling live performer of real substance. Though she now resides in Manchester, England, Hoop returned to Los Angeles to record her third album, The House That Jack Built. Jesca has quite the growing collection of fans in high places: Tom Waits described her music as being “like a four sided coin. She is an old soul, like a black pearl, a good witch or red moon. Her music is like going swimming in a lake at night”. Peter Gabriel took her to South America to sing with him, and in recent years she has been hand picked to play as support on tour for Eels, Andrew Bird, Punch Brothers, Shearwater and Elbow: Elbow’s Guy Garvey even has her do regular stints as guest presenter on his BBC radio show, to great reception. The follow up to 2009’s critically acclaimed Hunting My Dress, this new record displays a striking duality: light and dark, head and heart, it juxtaposes the macabre and visceral with a disarmingly candid intimacy. The resulting combination is powerfully evocative, with overarching themes of biology, nature and humanity – Hoop’s stone-turning observations are mired in the equal beauty and violence of a nature that, for her, is clearly red in tooth and claw. ","<p>Jesca Hoop has lived all over the map, and her rich life experience is reflected in her distinctive voice and natural gift for inventive song craft.</p> <p>Hoop learned to sing at an early age, harmonising with her musical Mormon family in northern California.

Weaving together elements of folk, jazz, pop and classical music, it sounds as if she spent years studying in old smoky theaters with icons Leonard Bernstein and Joni Mitchell directing the show, and The Beach Boys in the orchestra pit. A soulful, honeyed voice and lilting vibrato land her the leading role.Collaboration has proven to be a fundamental part of Johansing’s creative process. She has been a member of San Francisco groups Geographer and Honeycomb, and is a current member of the experimental folk duo Yesway. Johansing has shared the stage and contributed to projects with local talents Tune-Yards, Sean Hayes, Mirah and Thao Nguyen and has collaborated with French filmmaker Vincent Moon. Johansing’s latest release and sophomore LP, Grand Ghosts, evokes the wilderness of the California coastline that she now calls home and the isolated mountain towns in Colorado where she grew up. Sonically and thematically darker than her debut album Many Seasons (2010), Grand Ghosts grapples with loss, paying homage to loved ones who passed during the making of the record. While Many Seasons reads more like a playbill, featuring a rotating cast of skilled friends and local musicians, Grand Ghosts was intended to capture the chemistry shared by the more permanent cast consisting of Johansing (electric guitar, piano, organ, vocals), Jeremy Harris (guitar, piano, vocals, and string arrangements), Robert Shelton (keyboards), James Riotto (bass), Ezra Lipp (drums), and Andrew Maguire (vibraphone, percussion).","<p><em>Described by The Bay Bridged as “gorgeous acoustic pop”</em>, San Francisco based musician Kacey Johansing creates songs with meandering melodies, lush harmonies and moody aural landscapes.

At just 25 years of age he has released two critically acclaimed albums and one E.P. Made “Album of the Year” lists for both 2011’s “One Thousand Origami Birds” and 2012’s “Break Your Own Heart”. Toured with the likes of Josh Pyke, Matt Corby, Katie Noonan, Husky, Ingrid Michaelson, Brett Dennen and Joshua Radin both nationally and on foreign shores, taking in festivals from Woodford, Peats Ridge, Nannup, Mullumbimby Music and Playground Weekender to Canadian Music Week along the way. And even picked up a MusicOZ award whilst having songs used in TV shows from Covert Affairs to Packed To The Rafters. A little honesty goes a long way. Released through Gigpiglet Recordings / Inertia in April 2012 Break Your Own Heart sees a darker, more dynamic turn in Carty’s song writing coinciding with a year that was, in the words of the man himself: “Simultaneously one of the best and worst of my life.” From the rolling guitar line of opening track “The Length Of Canada” (co-written with Grammy Award Winning Songwriter Dan Wilson), through the gritty directness of “Everything, Unhappily”, the immense longing of songs like “Travelling Shoes” and “She Loves Me” to the ironically upbeat swagger of “She’s Got A Boyfriend” Break Your Own Heart is a stunningly unified, moving and thoughtful collection of songs that effortlessly captures a time and place in a young man’s life. A time and place most of us can relate to: “When I think of the year 2011 in the future I am sure I will overwhelmingly remember airports, highways, train stations and other people’s couches as we toured the first album. Break Your Own Heart is about that. Not the travel necessarily, but about giving up a lot in one area of your life in order to try and achieve your goals in another. I think that is a crossroads most people come to at some point along the way”, Carty explains. Since its release things have only gotten busier with Break Your Own Heart reaching #8 on the iTunes Australia Singer-Songwriter Chart and #15 on the Australian Independent Records chart, spawning an ever-growing, constant stream of headline shows all over Australia, whilst earning 4 star reviews from the likes of The Sydney Morning Herald & The Weekend Australian. A little honesty goes a long way. SYDNEY MORNING HERALD “An album of confession and honesty but also humour and the sublime” 4 out of 5 Stars. THE WEEKEND AUSTRALIAN “Sensational sophomore album…It marks him as a man to watch"" 4 out of 5 Stars. DOM ALESSIO, TRIPLE J “Put simply… Stunning.” DAVE RUBY HOWE, TRIPLE J “I’m a big fan of Jack’s chambray-adorned croon but I suppose I’m drawn to the steady pulse and electric echoes of [“She’s Got A Boyfriend”] right now. That’ll probably change though, all his songs are great to me.” RIPITUP “Carty proves that he’s an extremely capable and intelligent lyricist, who is able to ruminate on the grit of the situation with a youthful, surprising confidence.” THE AU REVIEW “Jack Carty Emerged from the back of the pub with a beer in hand, and shoeless-ly stepping onto the stage. His vocal lines are strong and consistent and his lyrics have an intrinsic, wholesome feel.

His first album,Too Long in the Wasteland (released in 1989), was produced by John Mellencamp and marked the beginning of a series of acclaimed projects for Columbia and Sugar Hill. In 1996, McMurtry received a Grammy nomination for his Longform Music Video ofWhere’d You Hide The Body. 1997’s It Had To Happen received the American Indie Award for Best Americana Album.In 2004, McMurtry released the universally lauded Live in Aught-Three on Compadre Records. 2005’s Childish Things garnered some of the highest critical praise of McMurtry’s career and spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Americana Music Radio Chart in 2005 and 2006. In September 2006, Childish Things and “We Can’t Make It Here” won the Americana Music Awards for Album and Song of the Year, respectively. McMurtry received more Americana Music Award nominations for 2008’s Just Us Kids. This album marked his highest Billboard 200 chart position in more than 19 years.In 2009, Live in Europe was released, capturing The McMurtry Band’s first European tour and extraordinary live set. Along with seasoned band members Ronnie Johnson, Daren Hess, and Tim Holt, the disc features special guests Ian McLagan and Jon Dee Graham. Also, for the first time ever, video of the James McMurtry Band’s live performance is available on the included DVD.The poignant lyrics of his immense catalog still ring true today. In 2011, “We Can’t Make It Here” was cited among ‘The Nation’s’ “Best Protest Songs Ever.” Bob Lefsetz writes, “‘We Can’t Make It Here’ has stood the test of time because of its unmitigated truth.”Never one to rest on his laurels, James McMurtry continues to tour constantly, and consistently puts on a “must-see” powerhouse performance. ‘The Washington Post’ noted McMurtry’s live prowess: “Much attention is paid to James McMurtry’s lyrics, and rightfully so: He creates a novel’s worth of emotion and experience in four minutes of blisteringly stark couplets. What gets overlooked, however, is that he’s an accomplished rock guitar player. At a sold-out Birchmere, the Austin-based artist was joined by drummer Daren Hess and bassist Ronnie Johnson in a set that demonstrated the raw power of wince-inducing imagery propelled by electric guitar.

HalleyAnna’s superb debut collection swaggers (“So Heavy”) and sways (“Fast Train”) with effortless elegance. The album, which deftly spotlights her meeting point between Patsy Cline and Emmylou Harris, serves as a shining introduction to a skyward bound emerging talent. High watermarks – particularly, “Back in Your Arms Again” and “Peace Is Lonely, Love Is War”– already show HalleyAnna growing exponentially sharp as a songwriter.“Experience is what happens when you don’t get what you want, so songwriting makes me feel better,” she says. “Any time I’d go through a heartache growing up, my dad would say, ‘Well, you’ll get a good song out of it.’ Sure enough, I really did. You can’t write every single song about how somebody broke your heart, so some of the stuff I’ve done is more serious. ‘Back in Your Arms Again’ may sound like a song about somebody who dumped you, but it has a much deeper, eternal, death-related theme about meeting in the next life.”For the last decade, HalleyAnna has honed her songwriting skills at Cheatham Street Warehouse, the legendary Central Texas listening room owned by her father, singer-songwriter Kent Finlay. She now leads the next generation of compelling writers who follow James McMurtry, Todd Snider, Bruce Robison and others who started out at Cheatham Street. “I grew up listening to people who play music in Texas,” says the youthful singer-songwriter. “I really love the traditional stuff that’s going on in East Nashville like Elizabeth Cook and Caitlin Rose and Hayes Carll and Slaid Cleaves here in Austin. They embody the same traditional country that I like.”All personify the literate storytelling so identified with the Texas music tradition and HalleyAnna has put her creative writing studies to good use following their footsteps. Look for further proof one her sophomore effort (due in early 2013). Americana all-star Bill Chambers (Kasey’s father) produced the collection. “Working with Bill is so easy and great,” HalleyAnna says. “Bill came up and was here for the summer touring with Kasey and he had about a week window to make a record with me. He brought this really nice microphone that Kasey used on ‘The Captain’ and ‘Barricades and Brickwalls’ and we did vocals pretty much live. We cut the album in five days in the Wood Shed in San Marcos.”Brian T.

We cut the album in five days in the Wood Shed in San Marcos.”</span><br><br><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; line-height: 13px;"">Brian T.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-lighthouse-and-the-whaler","The Lighthouse and the Whaler","Cleveland, Ohio","seen live, theartist","The Lighthouse and the Whaler is a band from Cleveland, Ohio, though its name alludes to the waters off the coast of Massachusetts. Inspired by a theme from Moby Dick, the band’s name alone is enough to make underpaid Literature teachers beam with pride. It all started with two musicians — Aaron Smith and Michael LoPresti — who decided to collaborate in a field one sunny afternoon because that seemed nicer than playing in a basement. By the end of the day they had written their first song. They gave it a profound name: “The Field Song.” When it was selected for a Paste Sampler CD, Aaron and Michael decided to make a proper run at it.The Lighthouse and the Whaler released a four-song EP in 2008 and a self-titled/produced/released album in 2009. Two songs from that album — “White Days” and “Under Mountain, Under Ground” — found their way to TV and radio. With more fans to play for, The Lighthouse and the Whaler hit the road and toured across America. Somewhere between Boston and Seattle, the band picked up three new members — Matthew, Mark and Steve – thereafter, fulfilling the prophesy that was to be five young men stuffed in a forest green Chevy Venture, searching for open ears and loyal hearts.Here is what most band bios won’t tell you:Michael LoPresti studied literature and theology in college but rushed home after graduation to become a musician. Michael is the voice of the band and his head is filled with wayward melodies one could chase for days. He wears boat shoes, jean cut-offs and flannel shirts all year round. Michael is a web designer and has approximately two dance moves. Put a chick flick on mute and he will make up hilarious new dialogue to go along with the picture. Aaron Smith is self-taught on the violin, guitar and keys. He is a skeptic, searching for each perfect note as it passes. Aaron has deadpan wit and incredibly white teeth. He eats Chia seeds and dried prunes to stay healthy on the road. Aaron is acutely aware of subtle details and often finds himself lost in his thoughts for long periods of time. He is a gentle giant, but is self-conscious about his height. And yes, he is single. Matthew LoPresti was on his way to becoming a professional soccer player but left the pitch to join The Lighthouse and the Whaler. Matthew is a percussionist and puts the passion and heart into the songs. He has a nice smile and often requires extra space on stage to accommodate his raw emotion. Matthew tells loud jokes because it makes everyone laugh more. He thinks LeBron James is a traitor and is dogmatic on the subject.Mark Poro was a solo artist who wanted some company. He plays mandolin, violin, guitar, piano and glockenspiel, but has yet to master the triangle. Mark is a lover of the poignant and sincere, and fills each song with his pure spirit. He secretly likes to be silly, especially in serious situations. Mark is perpetually training for a marathon and has blue eyes that would remind a sailor of a calm day at sea. Mark Poro is not his real name.Steve Diaz is originally from Virginia and met Mark at a music conservatory on Martha’s Vineyard. He moved to Ohio to become a Whaler, but otherwise would have probably become a farmer. Steve is a born composer and adds contrast and depth to the music with a seasoned subtlety. Steve can grow a glorious reddish-brown beard, which he credits to his unique ancestry. He writes music to maintain his sanity. Steve is not homeless, though he sometimes looks it. The Lighthouse and the Whaler plays indie-folk-pop and does not believe that genre labels tell you anything you need to know about a band. It has nevertheless caught the attention of MTV, Fuse, FILTER, Spinner, Under the Radar and other media outlets that cater to indie-folk-pop music fans.The Lighthouse and the Whaler has performed at venues like House of Blues, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Rockwood Music Hall and SXSW, though its favorite show to date took place in the attic of an old bookstore. The band has also shared stages with Sufjan Stevens, The Temper Trap and The Dodos, and shared blankets while sleeping in its donated mini-van, inappropriately named Rihanna.John Richards of KEXP called The Lighthouse and the Whaler his new favorite band. He may be the smartest man on the planet.","<p>The Lighthouse and the Whaler is a band from Cleveland, Ohio, though its name alludes to the waters off the coast of Massachusetts.

According to Lead Vocalist Beau Tyler We The Ghost formed out of loss but soon became the inspiration to move on. “I was at the end of a long and terrible relationship and after the death of several friends, I sold my home in Dallas and moved to Tulsa, OK. I was crashing on Dain’s couch, totally depressed and didn’t even move for at least a couple of weeks. Finally, one day Dain came in and handed me a guitar and forced me to start writing again. Those songs quickly became our first album.” Tyler stated the passion from the musicians that came together to become We The Ghost have not only created something that is intensely personal but also original. “When something is so beautiful that it allows me to return to my pre-instrumentalist innocence, it’s a beautiful thing. My favorite thing is the look on a crowd’s face when they’re enjoying our music and I can tell they’ve never heard anything like it. It’s like we’ve created a breath of fresh air for everyone.

In fact, that is how Rob, Niem, Kendall, and Jeremy all met each other, in high school band. Rob and Niem, both trombone players, Kendall, a saxophonist, and Jeremy, a drummer. They all have very different ways of seeing the musical spectrum.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/heidi-happy","Heidi Happy","Luzern, Switz","singer-songwriter, female vocalists, swiss","HEIDI HAPPY BIOGRAPHY (ENGLISH) Within six years and three abums, swiss singer-songwriter Heidi Happy evolved from a folkie flowergirl to a mature composer for band and orchestra. The outstanding singer from the countryside of Lucerne is not only a major figure in Swiss pop music, but a fascinatingly creative artist with international success. To a wide and ever growing audience, Heidi Happy has been known as a renowned swiss songwriter with a preference for orchestral music. However, the 31 year-old Lucerne resident is an artist who not only writes, arranges and produces her music, but who also designs her websites and co-directs her videos. Which is unusual, particularly if you consider that she was only supposed to give but one single concert. But after this gig in April 2005 equipped with an acoustic guitar, a loop machine and a floor lamp, her name would appear on more and more flyers. On her first album Back Together (2007) Ms. Happy presented heself as a playful folk-girlie. Smooth vocals, coy lyrics and flowery videos portrayed the image of a newcomer who, thanks to hits like Back Together, was euphorically greeted by the media but wouldn’t take herself all too serious. All self-mockery, however, could not conceal the exceptional talent in this outstanding young singer and songwriter. This was noted by promoters and the public in Europe and the U.S., too, which lead Heidi Happy to a long stretch of live shows. The album was recorded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where Ms. Happy was completing her studies in audio-visual communication. Therefore the self-designed booklets and websites, and therefore her directing the video to Du da, ich da, which was part of her diploma. In 2008 Ms. Happy returned to Switzerland and released Flowers, Birds, and Home. The transitional album, as she calls it today, pointed out the way to go. The songs still sounded airy and centered around the vocals and the guitar, but you could also hear a greater lyrical seriousness and an increased complexity in the arrangements. For the recording and the following tour, Ms. Happy assembled some of Switzerland’s most respected young musicians: With Ephrem Lüchinger (keys), Gregor Heini (guitar), André Pousaz (stand-up bass) and Arno Troxler (drums), Heidi Happy played increasingly bigger stages all over the world, and her albums got released in Germany, Austria, Canada and Japan. At the same time she became a congenial singing partner for respected and upcoming artists like Yello, Stephan Eicher, The Sad Riders, Zwicker, Favez, Coal and Monotales. But where did all this music come from? As a child, young Heidi used to record songs on a tape deck with as many instruments as possible; she was intrigued by the diversity of sounds. Her mother instructed her to play the piano when she was seven, at nine she took to the cello, and later on she taught herself to play the guitar. The foundation for her love for orchestral music was laid in the back country of Lucerne it would soon be heard all around. With her third album Hiding with the Wolves (2011) Heidi Happy fulfilled herself a dream: writing a piece for a whole orchestra. There had been instruments like vibraphones or kettle drums on her recordings before, but such a symphonic album was unheard of in Switzerland. Ms. Happy had retired to compose to the shores of lake Untersee for four months, returning with material for an album that presented her as an adult, serious songwriter. The lyrics were deeper, they told of the downsides of life and love and the potholes in roads taken alone. With Charlie Zimmermann on guitar, the band was enlarged with the Ensemble Camerata Musica (Lucerne). After recording, Ms. Happy flew to L.A. to get her album mixed by Andrew Scheps and mastered by Bernie Grundman. The west coast provided the setting for the video to Sarah, which she again co-produced with her friend Corina Schwingruber. The effort was worthwile: With Hiding with the Wolves she moved to the the famous Two Gentlemen label, the critics were raving, and the premiere took place in Lausanne with a big orhestra. It’s been quite a way from folky flowerchild to mature songwriter and it was worth taking. With this album for band and orchestra, Heidi Happy presents herself in all her diversity, and in full bloom. HEIDI HAPPY BIOGRAFIE (DEUTSCH) In sechs Jahren und drei Alben hat sich Heidi Happy vom blumigen Folk-Girl zu einer reifen Komponistin für Band und Orchester entwickelt. Die hervorragende Sängerin gehört prägt mit ihrer aussergewöhnlichen Musik die Schweizer Popmusik und feiert internationale Erfolge. Heidi Happy ist einem breiten Publikum bekannt als eigenwillige Singer-Songwriterin mit einer Vorliebe für Orchestermusik. Die 30-jährige Luzernerin ist eine Frau, die nicht nur ihre Musik selber schreibt, arrangiert und produziert, sondern auch ihre Webseiten designt und ihre Videos mitkonzipiert. Dabei war eigentlich war nur ein einziges Konzert vorgesehen. Doch nach einem Auftritt im April 2005 mit Gitarre, Loopgerät und Stehlampe begann Heidi Happys Name auf immer mehr Flyern und Programmheften zu stehen. Auf ihrem ersten Album Back Together (2007) präsentierte sich Heidi Happy als kindlich-verspieltes Folk-Girl. Sanfte Stimme, neckische Texte und blumige Videos zeichneten das Bild einer Newcomerin, die dank Hits wie Back Together von den Medien euphorisch begrüsst wurde, sich selber aber nicht übermässig ernst nahm. Alle Selbstironie konnte aber nicht verbergen, dass hier eine aussergewöhnlich gute Sängerin und Komponistin heranreifte. Das fanden auch Hörerinnen und Veranstalter in ganz Europa und den USA, wo Heidy Happy eine Menge Konzerte gab. Aufgenommen hatte Heidi Happy das Album in der Nähe von Amsterdam, denn dort hatte sie an der Kunstschule audiovisuelle Gestaltung studiert. Daher die selber designten CD-Booklets und Webseiten, und daher auch ihre Regiearbeit zum Video Du da, ich da, das Teil ihrer Abschlussarbeit war. 2008 kehrte Heidi Happy aus Holland zurück in die Schweiz und veröffentlichte Flowers, Birds, and Home. Das Übergangsalbum, wie sie es heute nennt, machte klar, wohin die musikalische Entwicklung gehen würde. Die Lieder klangen immer noch leicht und luftig, Stimme und akustische Gitarre standen immer noch im Zentrum, aber gegenüber dem Debüt waren komplexere Arrangements und eine gesteigerte Ernsthaftigkeit zu hören. Für Aufnahmen und Tour scharte Heidi Happy hervorragende Musiker um sich: Zusammen mit Ephrem Lüchinger (Tasten), Gregor Heini (Gitarre), André Pousaz (Kontrabass) und Arno Troxler (Drums) bespielte Heidi Happy auf der ganzen Welt Bühnen, die immer grösser wurden. Ihre Alben kamen mittlerweile in Deutschland, Österreich, Kanada und Japan heraus. Gleichzeitig entwickelte sie sich zu einer kongenialen Gastsängerin: Heidi Happy veredelte Stücke von Yello, Stephan Eicher, The Sad Riders, Coal und Monotales. Aber woher kam eigentlich die Musik? Schon als Kind bespielte die kleine Heidi Kassetten mit eigenen Songs und möglichst vielen Instrumenten, die Vielfalt faszinierte sie. Ihren ersten Klavierunterricht hatte sie mit sieben bei ihrer Mutter. Mit neun spielte sie Cello, später brachte sie sich selber das Gitarrenspiel bei. Der Grundstein für die Liebe zum Orchester war gelegt sie sollte bald weitum hörbar sein. Mit ihrem dritten Album Hiding with the Wolves erfüllte sich Heidi Happy 2011 den Kindheitstraum, ein Werk für ein ganzes Orchester zu schreiben. Schon auf ihren ersten zwei Alben waren Instrumente wie Pauke oder Vibraphon zu hören. Doch ein derart symphonisches Popalbum hatte die Schweiz noch nicht gehört. Vier Monate hatte sie sich an den Untersee zurückgezogen und in völliger Abgeschiedenheit ein Album komponiert, das sie als reife Songwriterin und ernst zu nehmende Komponistin präsentierte. Die Texte sind komplexer geworden, sie behandeln nun auch die dunklen Seiten der Liebe und die Schlaglöcher auf Wegen, die man alleine geht. Die Band, neu mit Charlie Zimmermann an der Gitarre, wurde erweitert um das Luzerner Ensemble Camerata Musica. Nach den Aufnahmen flog Heidi Happy nach Los Angeles, um die Platte mit Andrew Scheps zu mischen und von Bernie Grundman mastern zu lassen. An der US-Westküste produzierte sie zusammen mit ihrer Freundin Corina Schwingruber den Videoclip zur ersten Single Sarah. Der Aufwand hat sich gelohnt: Mit Hiding with the Wolves zog Heidi Happy zum renommierten Label Two Gentlemen, das Medienecho war hervorragend, und die Uraufführung fand in Lausanne mit grossem Orcheser statt. Es war ein langer Weg vom folkigen Blumenkind zur reifen Songwriterin und er hat sich gelohnt. Mit diesem Album für Band und Orchester präsentiert sich Heidi Happy in all ihrer Vielseitigkeit und in voller Blüte. PRESS RELEASE ENGLISH HEIDI HAPPY, Hiding With The Wolves Most people would be content with the career that Heidi Happy had made for herself. Two albums, a growing success not only nationally but also in Japan, the USA, Canada and Europe based on a strong musical identity of playful pop spiked with strings. The acclaim for the cute, fun persona she had created was growing. But Heidi Happy, thank God, is not most people. Aiming for a challenge that would put to good use her love and knowledge of classical arrangements, her innate sense of musical beauty and her soft, delicate song crafting, she set herself to work on a true, honest and ambitious classical pop album. Retreating to the frozen Lake of Constance, she locked up her house and let go of an array of emotions she had, as of yet, kept her songs protected from. Secluded, visited by the slow, curious animals of winter and later by the lively beasts of spring, old stories long forgotten came to life again. Day by day, she carved her words into the fascinating fabrics of a symphonic orchestra, illuminating them with the modern gravitas of her evolving folk songwriting sensitivities. Not unlike a youthful, female Ennio Morricone or an emotional early sixties Frank Sinatra, she wrote, composed and arranged an album of sensual innocence, of immense purity, of sophisticated abandon. Along with the stellar songwriting and that ever so beautiful voice, what makes this record so endearing is the understated use of the orchestra. Unlike so many pop artists who fall into the trap of overblown Disney style arrangements, Heidi Happy uses the classical instruments as they were meant to be, an elegant accompaniment of velvet strings and muffled brass, never overshadowing the band, always complementing the song. That she could guide so many musicians to create a work of such staggering intimacy might be the biggest tour de force of this young woman. From a house on the frozen shores of a small Swiss lake to a gigantic classical studio to the Los Angeles mixing desk of Andrew Scheps (known for his work with Johnny Cash or My Brightest Diamond) to the mastering rooms of Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson), Heidi Happy has stayed true to the purity of her vision and has created a timeless album. Her songs of love, loss, ports and horse rides are as haunting as the nature that surrounded their birth, as precious and innocent as the voice that gave them life and as beautifully soothing as the spring that will see them released at last. PRESS RELEASE GERMAN HEIDI HAPPY, Hiding With The Wolves In ihrem dritten Album nimmt uns Heidi Happy mit auf einen fantastischen Traumflug. Neben der Band ist diesmal ein ganzes Orchester mit dabei, ausserdem wilde Tiere und sehr viel Herz. Die Schweizer Künstlerin fliegt mit «Hiding With The Wolves» konsequent auf ihrer eigenen Bahn weiter. Mit «Back Together»(2007) blühte eine Blume auf, in «Flowers, Birds and Home» (2009) spielten Vögel, Hasen und Rehe auf der Wiese. Nun wagt sich Heidi Happy mit Wölfen in den Wunderwald. Und sie lässt in diesem poetischen Gelände Klassik und Pop zusammen tanzen. Die Schweizer Songwriterin überrascht mit einem mutigen Epos. «Hiding With The Wolves» ist weit mehr als eine Reihe mit Streichern untermalte Popsongs, sondern ein originelles musikalisches Kunstwerk für Band und Orchester, ein klassischer Soundtrack zu einem Kino der Gefühle. In Heidi Happys zauberhaften Welten fühlt man sich zuhause und wird von den Stimmungen überwältigt. Das Herzenserlebnis erinnert an den Meister Ennio Morricone, Joni Mitchell oder an den Sound von Frank Sinatra. Das berührende Werk entstand in der Abgeschiedenheit am Ufer des Bodensees und erhielt in Los Angeles den letzten Schliff. Wie bereits bei ihren ersten beiden Alben schrieb, komponierte und arrangierte Heidi Happy alle Songs selbst. Musikalisch klettert sie dabei eine Stufe weiter. Band und klassische Instrumente setzt sie gleichberechtigt, unkonventionell und voller sanfter Effekte ein. Die Arrangements sind dabei so fein und liebevoll, dass Heidi Happys Sound intim bleibt. Durch diesen kunstvoll gewobenen, federleichten Klangstoff strahlt Heidi Happys Stimme in ihrer ganzen Vielfalt. Melancholie war nie so zärtlich, tröstlich, frech. Es ist Musik, um zuhause in verflossener Liebe zu schwelgen. Ihren grossartigen Bandmusikern ist Heidi übrigens treu geblieben. Gemischt wurde «Hiding With The Wolves» vom Ton-Ingenieur Andrew Scheps (Johnny Cash, My Brightest Diamond), das Mastering besorgte Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson). Bereits Heidi Happys zweites Album erschien in Europa, Japan und Kanada. Seit 2009 spielte sie rund um die Welt und sang unter anderem mit Yello, Coal, Stephan Eicher, D-Sisive, Monotales, The Sad Riders, Handsome Hank und Zwicker. Jetzt erobert Heidi Happy furchtlos weitere Sphären und beschert ihrem Publikum damit fabelhafte Momente von grenzenlosem Glück. PRESS RELEASE FRENCH HEIDI HAPPY, Hiding With The Wolves La plupart des gens se contenteraient de la carrière que Heidi Happy s’est forgée. Deux albums, un succès grandissant non seulement en Suisse mais aussi au Japon, aux USA, au Canada et en Europe, une identité forte faite de morceaux pop aux ludiques arrangements de cordes, une personnalité gaie et fraîche, la machine était en marche. Mais Heidi Happy, Dieu merci, n’est pas comme la plupart des gens. Toujours à la recherche d’un nouveau challenge qui pourrait mettre à profit son amour et sa science des arrangements classiques, son sens inné de la mélodie et son songwriting délicat, elle s’est attelée à la confection d’un album de pop orchestrée ambitieux et sincère. Terrée dans une maison côtière sise sur les bords du lac de Constance, elle s’est libérée d’un trop plein d’émotions jusqu’alors retenues. Visitée par les vents froids du soir, par les curieux animaux de l’hiver puis par ceux que le printemps avait éveillés, elle a laissé remonter de vieilles histoires qu’elle croyait à tout jamais enfouies. Jour après jour, elle a joint ses mots simples et personnels aux sonorités fascinantes d’un orchestre symphonique, illuminant le tout de sa sensibilité folk florissante. A l’instar d’un Ennio Morricone ou d’un Frank Sinatra, la féminité et la juvénilité en plus, elle a écrit, composé et arrangé un album tout empreint de pureté, d’innocence sensuelle, de délassement sophistiqué. Aux côtés de cette voix bouleversante et de ces chansons envoutantes, ce qui rend cet album particulièrement fascinant se trouve dans l’utilisation tout en légèreté de l’orchestre symphonique. Alors que tant d’artistes pop tombent dans le piège de la facilité, dans les pompeux arrangements à la Walt Disney, Heidi Happy place ses instruments classiques en finesse. Un subtil accompagnement de cordes veloutées, de cuivres élégants qui complètent délicatement la voix sans jamais prendre le pas sur le groupe. Que cette jeune femme ait su diriger tant de musiciens pour créer un oeuvre si intime est sans doute son plus prodigieux accomplissement. D’une maison au bord du lac de Constance au studio de mastering de Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson) en passant par la gigantesque salle d’enregistrement d’un studio classique et par la table de mixage d’Andrew Scheps (réputé pour son travail avec Johnny Cash ou My Brightest Diamond), Heidi Happy est restée fidèle à la pureté de sa vision. Ses chansons d’amours perdues, de ports abandonnés et de chevaux errants sont aussi précieuses, innocentes et naturelles que leur interprète. Un album apaisant, réconfortant qui vous hantera longtemps.","<p><span class=""caps"">HEIDI</span> <span class=""caps"">HAPPY</span> <span class=""caps"">BIOGRAPHY</span> (<span class=""caps"">ENGLISH</span>)</p> <p>Within six years and three abums, swiss singer-songwriter Heidi Happy evolved from a folkie flowergirl to a mature composer for band and orchestra.

Die Texte sind komplexer geworden, sie behandeln nun auch die dunklen Seiten der Liebe und die Schlaglöcher auf Wegen, die man alleine geht. Die Band, neu mit Charlie Zimmermann an der Gitarre, wurde erweitert um das Luzerner Ensemble Camerata Musica. Nach den Aufnahmen flog Heidi Happy nach Los Angeles, um die Platte mit Andrew Scheps zu mischen und von Bernie Grundman mastern zu lassen. An der US-Westküste produzierte sie zusammen mit ihrer Freundin Corina Schwingruber den Videoclip zur ersten Single Sarah. Der Aufwand hat sich gelohnt: Mit Hiding with the Wolves zog Heidi Happy zum renommierten Label Two Gentlemen, das Medienecho war hervorragend, und die Uraufführung fand in Lausanne mit grossem Orcheser statt.</p> <p>Es war ein langer Weg vom folkigen Blumenkind zur reifen Songwriterin und er hat sich gelohnt. Mit diesem Album für Band und Orchester präsentiert sich Heidi Happy in all ihrer Vielseitigkeit und in voller Blüte.</p> <hr /> <p><span class=""caps"">PRESS</span> <span class=""caps"">RELEASE</span> <span class=""caps"">ENGLISH</span></p> <p><span class=""caps"">HEIDI</span> <span class=""caps"">HAPPY</span>, Hiding With The Wolves</p> <p>Most people would be content with the career that Heidi Happy had made for herself. Two albums, a growing success not only nationally but also in Japan, the <span class=""caps"">USA</span>, Canada and Europe based on a strong musical identity of playful pop spiked with strings. The acclaim for the cute, fun persona she had created was growing. But Heidi Happy, thank God, is not most people.</p> <p>Aiming for a challenge that would put to good use her love and knowledge of classical arrangements, her innate sense of musical beauty and her soft, delicate song crafting, she set herself to work on a true, honest and ambitious classical pop album. Retreating to the frozen Lake of Constance, she locked up her house and let go of an array of emotions she had, as of yet, kept her songs protected from. Secluded, visited by the slow, curious animals of winter and later by the lively beasts of spring, old stories long forgotten came to life again. Day by day, she carved her words into the fascinating fabrics of a symphonic orchestra, illuminating them with the modern gravitas of her evolving folk songwriting sensitivities. Not unlike a youthful, female Ennio Morricone or an emotional early sixties Frank Sinatra, she wrote, composed and arranged an album of sensual innocence, of immense purity, of sophisticated abandon.</p> <p>Along with the stellar songwriting and that ever so beautiful voice, what makes this record so endearing is the understated use of the orchestra. Unlike so many pop artists who fall into the trap of overblown Disney style arrangements, Heidi Happy uses the classical instruments as they were meant to be, an elegant accompaniment of velvet strings and muffled brass, never overshadowing the band, always complementing the song. That she could guide so many musicians to create a work of such staggering intimacy might be the biggest tour de force of this young woman.</p> <p>From a house on the frozen shores of a small Swiss lake to a gigantic classical studio to the Los Angeles mixing desk of Andrew Scheps (known for his work with Johnny Cash or My Brightest Diamond) to the mastering rooms of Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson), Heidi Happy has stayed true to the purity of her vision and has created a timeless album. Her songs of love, loss, ports and horse rides are as haunting as the nature that surrounded their birth, as precious and innocent as the voice that gave them life and as beautifully soothing as the spring that will see them released at last.</p> <p><span class=""caps"">PRESS</span> <span class=""caps"">RELEASE</span> <span class=""caps"">GERMAN</span></p> <p><span class=""caps"">HEIDI</span> <span class=""caps"">HAPPY</span>, Hiding With The Wolves</p> <p>In ihrem dritten Album nimmt uns Heidi Happy mit auf einen fantastischen Traumflug. Neben der Band ist diesmal ein ganzes Orchester mit dabei, ausserdem wilde Tiere und sehr viel Herz. <br /> Die Schweizer Künstlerin fliegt mit «Hiding With The Wolves» konsequent auf ihrer eigenen Bahn weiter.</p> <p>Mit «Back Together»(2007) blühte eine Blume auf, in «Flowers, Birds and Home» (2009) spielten Vögel, Hasen und Rehe auf der Wiese. Nun wagt sich Heidi Happy mit Wölfen in den Wunderwald. Und sie lässt in diesem poetischen Gelände Klassik und Pop zusammen tanzen.</p> <p>Die Schweizer Songwriterin überrascht mit einem mutigen Epos. «Hiding With The Wolves» ist weit mehr als eine Reihe mit Streichern untermalte Popsongs, sondern ein originelles musikalisches Kunstwerk für Band und Orchester, ein klassischer Soundtrack zu einem Kino der Gefühle. In Heidi Happys zauberhaften Welten fühlt man sich zuhause und wird von den Stimmungen überwältigt. Das Herzenserlebnis erinnert an den Meister Ennio Morricone, Joni Mitchell oder an den Sound von Frank Sinatra.</p> <p>Das berührende Werk entstand in der Abgeschiedenheit am Ufer des Bodensees und erhielt in Los Angeles den letzten Schliff. Wie bereits bei ihren ersten beiden Alben schrieb, komponierte und arrangierte Heidi Happy alle Songs selbst. Musikalisch klettert sie dabei eine Stufe weiter. Band und klassische Instrumente setzt sie gleichberechtigt, unkonventionell und voller sanfter Effekte ein. Die Arrangements sind dabei so fein und liebevoll, dass Heidi Happys Sound intim bleibt.</p> <p>Durch diesen kunstvoll gewobenen, federleichten Klangstoff strahlt Heidi Happys Stimme in ihrer ganzen Vielfalt. Melancholie war nie so zärtlich, tröstlich, frech. Es ist Musik, um zuhause in verflossener Liebe zu schwelgen. Ihren grossartigen Bandmusikern ist Heidi übrigens treu geblieben. Gemischt wurde «Hiding With The Wolves» vom Ton-Ingenieur Andrew Scheps (Johnny Cash, My Brightest Diamond), das Mastering besorgte Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson).</p> <p>Bereits Heidi Happys zweites Album erschien in Europa, Japan und Kanada. Seit 2009 spielte sie rund um die Welt und sang unter anderem mit Yello, Coal, Stephan Eicher, D-Sisive, Monotales, The Sad Riders, Handsome Hank und Zwicker. Jetzt erobert Heidi Happy furchtlos weitere Sphären und beschert ihrem Publikum damit fabelhafte Momente von grenzenlosem Glück.</p> <p><span class=""caps"">PRESS</span> <span class=""caps"">RELEASE</span> <span class=""caps"">FRENCH</span></p> <p><span class=""caps"">HEIDI</span> <span class=""caps"">HAPPY</span>, Hiding With The Wolves</p> <p>La plupart des gens se contenteraient de la carrière que Heidi Happy s’est forgée. Deux albums, un succès grandissant non seulement en Suisse mais aussi au Japon, aux <span class=""caps"">USA</span>, au Canada et en Europe, une identité forte faite de morceaux pop aux ludiques arrangements de cordes, une personnalité gaie et fraîche, la machine était en marche. Mais Heidi Happy, Dieu merci, n’est pas comme la plupart des gens.</p> <p>Toujours à la recherche d’un nouveau challenge qui pourrait mettre à profit son amour et sa science des arrangements classiques, son sens inné de la mélodie et son songwriting délicat, elle s’est attelée à la confection d’un album de pop orchestrée ambitieux et sincère. Terrée dans une maison côtière sise sur les bords du lac de Constance, elle s’est libérée d’un trop plein d’émotions jusqu’alors retenues. Visitée par les vents froids du soir, par les curieux animaux de l’hiver puis par ceux que le printemps avait éveillés, elle a laissé remonter de vieilles histoires qu’elle croyait à tout jamais enfouies. Jour après jour, elle a joint ses mots simples et personnels aux sonorités fascinantes d’un orchestre symphonique, illuminant le tout de sa sensibilité folk florissante. A l’instar d’un Ennio Morricone ou d’un Frank Sinatra, la féminité et la juvénilité en plus, elle a écrit, composé et arrangé un album tout empreint de pureté, d’innocence sensuelle, de délassement sophistiqué.</p> <p>Aux côtés de cette voix bouleversante et de ces chansons envoutantes, ce qui rend cet album particulièrement fascinant se trouve dans l’utilisation tout en légèreté de l’orchestre symphonique. Alors que tant d’artistes pop tombent dans le piège de la facilité, dans les pompeux arrangements à la Walt Disney, Heidi Happy place ses instruments classiques en finesse. Un subtil accompagnement de cordes veloutées, de cuivres élégants qui complètent délicatement la voix sans jamais prendre le pas sur le groupe. Que cette jeune femme ait su diriger tant de musiciens pour créer un oeuvre si intime est sans doute son plus prodigieux accomplissement.</p> <p>D’une maison au bord du lac de Constance au studio de mastering de Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson) en passant par la gigantesque salle d’enregistrement d’un studio classique et par la table de mixage d’Andrew Scheps (réputé pour son travail avec Johnny Cash ou My Brightest Diamond), Heidi Happy est restée fidèle à la pureté de sa vision. Ses chansons d’amours perdues, de ports abandonnés et de chevaux errants sont aussi précieuses, innocentes et naturelles que leur interprète. Un album apaisant, réconfortant qui vous hantera longtemps.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/5469739/91dad988a877bf0b217e54f2eeee0e0f_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/k8rrToMiXm8?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

They later recruited vocalist Ven Scott to front their cause and experienced rapid growth almost immediately. After having made the appropriate contacts, the group recorded their rhetoric and propaganda, titling it ‘Mark the Resistance’. The spread of their message, or ‘Resistance’, was only further compounded when the Heavy Metal director of the largest Rock and Roll radio station in Texas offered to broadcast their message on his program, No Control (we are currently investigating his involvement). Please refer to ‘By Design’ in the attached Known Rhetoric sheet. In the extremely short time they have been active, their following has grown many fold. They gained the support of an operative local to Austin, Texas; an almost exclusive Heavy Metal promoter who right away began placing them on road shows with national and regional names. This is unacceptable. With the release of their C.D., the support they have gained from local enthusiasts (as well as respected professionals in both promotions and radio), and the subsequent infiltration of neighboring provinces, Dead Earth Politics is expanding their reach. This group is charismatic, their ‘lyrics’ are charged with an idea that change is imminent and they have all either been schooled or tutored by the likes of Iron Maiden, Lamb of God, Slayer, Morbid Angel, Mastodon as well as others. What makes this situation even more worrisome is their ability to carry on the tradition of tone and attack of their mentors. This memo is being sent to all district and local offices. Keep an eye out in your city or town. Your office will be updated as we gather more intelligence on the cell known as Dead Earth Politics.","<p>The cell known as ‘Dead Earth Politics’ was established by three primary members: Mason ‘Chevo’ Evans (Drums), Ernie ‘Uno’ Clark (Guitar), and Will ‘Waffle’ Little (Bass).

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/hidden-pictures","Hidden Pictures","kansas city/lawrence","","Released July 2012 on newly minted Kansas City label Golden Sound Records, Hidden Pictures’ third LP Rainbow Records is a festival of open-window jams and summery anthems that finds the band hitting a high-spirited, fresh, and powerpop-inflected stride. Rainbow Records benefits from the added rhythmic firepower of drummer Cameron Hawk (better known as the reckless frontman of The Dead Girls) and bassist Erik Voeks (also a first-order songwriter in his own right). The whole mess was mixed to a sonically perfect wonderstew by Ed Rose, man-at-knobs for celebrated popsters like the Get Up Kids and Ultimate Fakebook. While all of Richard’s shrugging romanticism is still intact, Rainbow Records touches on a new theme: the bittersweet decline of the music industry. “Calling Christine” salutes an aging partygirl who gets drunk and dances to ‘80s music to the chagrin of lookers-on. “Solo Record Shop” is an elegy to once-great songwriters who have lost their touch. “Oldies 104.3” lambastes the oldies format for becoming watered down with bloated ‘70s megahits. “Rainbow Records” contemplates the death of the CD while paying homage to the suburban Chicago record store Richard frequented as a teenager. Most importantly, Rainbow Records is a heartening, sophisticated, and riotously fun record from a band that has consistently demonstrated a knack for perfect pop portraiture. Hidden Pictures began in 2008, when Michelle Gaume Sanders crashed the all-boys party that was the final lineup of Richard’s longstanding band OK Jones. Stepping up as backup singer and glockenspiel plinker, Michelle brought new harmony to Richard’s table, which previously had been wrought with driving, Americana-tinged indie pop. As Hidden Pictures, the duo released a self-titled debut of clever acoustic ballads about the joys and foibles of romance that laid the thematic foundation for the more adventurous work to come. Seeking to flesh out their sound, Richard and Michelle assembled a backing band of musicians and studio wonks representing the best of their native Kansas City scene. The newly expanded Pics produced two crisp EPs (Choosing Sides, Whitney Houston) before turning out the acclaimed 2011 full-length Synchronized Sleeping. A fully-realized gem of reverb-laden hooks, tight harmonies, and Richard’s wry and sweet commentary on the push and pull of relationships, Synchronized Sleeping featured numbers like the pro-argument anthem “Choosing Sides,” the infectious library love story “Anne Apparently,” and the winking slowdance “For the Sake of the Streak.” Hidden Pictures has twice being nominated for Best Pop Band by Kansas City altweekly The Pitch. Sanders played her last show with the band in October 2012, opening the door for new collaborations on the Pics’ forthcoming 2013 LP. - Jason Harper","<p>Released July 2012 on newly minted Kansas City label Golden Sound Records, Hidden Pictures’ third LP Rainbow Records is a festival of open-window jams and summery anthems that finds the band hitting a high-spirited, fresh, and powerpop-inflected stride.</p> <p>Rainbow Records benefits from the added rhythmic firepower of drummer Cameron Hawk (better known as the reckless frontman of The Dead Girls) and bassist Erik Voeks (also a first-order songwriter in his own right).

Johnston’s first album, ""The Trouble Tree"" was released in 1990, and features the guitar playing of the roots musician and author, David Hamburger. Johnston sold some of his family’s farmland to finance the recording of his second album, Can You Fly (an event he wrote about in a song on that album, ""Trying to Tell You I Don’t Know""). Johnston followed up with his 1994 major label debut This Perfect World, which received rave reviews and led to Rolling Stone Magazine naming him ""songwriter of the year"". That album also spawned a minor alternative hit with the song ""Bad Reputation"". Johnston’s songs are often about troubled loners, and cover topics like heartbreak, alienation and disappointment. Known for the craftsmanship of his songs, he has sometimes been called a ""songwriter’s songwriter"". He has contributed songs to the soundtracks for movies including Kingpin and Things to Do in Denver When You’re Dead. Johnston and fellow musicians Jay Moran, James ""Pie"" Cowan, Duke Erikson, and Butch Vig perform occasional shows as a covers band called ""The Know-It-All Boyfriends."" Johnston is reportedly going to release a double-album called ""Rain on the City"" in 2007.

From being raised by the queens of musical theater, to being toughened up by the seasoned cats of R&B and taken under the wing of rock-n-roll; Bell’s large musical family has created an extremely original and compelling monster. With a voice that fits in the realm of her soulful British female counterparts, she backs it up with an energetic rock-n-soul vibe. While giving a nod to the great musical souls of the past, Bell didn’t just close her eyes and throwback a few stones hoping to catch the resurrected wave of the 60’s and 70’s. “I wanted to create a record of songs that captured the energy of what naturally comes out of me, the musicians I work with, and I wanted to stay true to the neighborhood I grew up in.” Montrose neighborhood in Houston, TX- where Bell had her first encounter with singer/songwriter, John Evans, and producer/co-writer of her debut record. “It was a special music scene going on there, Delta blues, southern roots music; musicians inspired by the greats- Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, Gene VIncent, etc.” At 19, Bell was bar tending and singing with bands in the scene. “These were my friends and some of my greatest musical influences. And when I saw John play for the first time, he immediately became a great friend and influence.” In 2006, Emily moved to the west coast, where she wrote, sang and recorded with former members of Tony Toni Tone, and Lucy Pearl. ""My musical world began to open up to whole new planets.” After a few years, Bell felt the longing to bring her newly discovered planets back to where she came from. “Texas is home to me. It’s also where my musical roots are.” states Emily. Back in Texas, a run in with her old friend John Evans changed things. “We immediately began collaborating on songs. I wanted to tie the thread between what I experienced musically on the west coast to my musical roots back home. John was the perfect guy to do that with. He’s been crossing boundaries in southern music for over a decade."" Together their inspirations span from The Ronnettes to Otis Redding, Gene Vincent to Hank Williams, and The Stones to The Stooges. The result is a collection of high energy, highly original songs. Her first release is a Double A Side featuring two songs off the record, “Back to the Way I Was”, a stompy rock and soul number that cleverly captures Bell’s return to the place of her roots and “Pusher Girl” a distorted bluesy track with a vocal delivery from Bell that captures the days of when a woman sang about freedom with belted power and seduction. All in all, it showcases a collection of songs that are built with old school steel, but the tracks they ride on are polished and new. Bell is dropping the Double A side available on 7’ vinyl and ITunes in December.","<p>Somewhere in the world between technicolored soul, southern blues and 60’s rock-n-roll, Austin, TX singer/songwriter, Emily Bell, has a debut disc that sonically fits on it’s own planet.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/larry-g","Larry g(EE)","Dallas, TX","","Modern, yet timeless. If you had to sum up Larry g(EE)’s debut EP, “Weekends,” those three words would be a fine start. You can hear the echoes of classic Stax sides in the punchy horns of “Yo Mama” and feel the intense romanticism of vintage Motown singles in the piercing ballad “I’m Your Fool.” Yet, unlike so many musicians drawing inspiration from those fertile sources, Larry isn’t interested in meticulous recreation: “I’m anything but a pure traditionalist or revivalist,” he says. Indeed, in the era of Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr, Larry g(EE) strives for something authentic and original, making a connection to eternal feelings through his music. Call it a proudly analog vision in a fully digital world.The Dallas-based singer-songwriter first made waves and earned critical acclaim as fiery frontman for rock band Odis, but felt the need for a creative rejuvenation, something far funkier and more soulful. In 2010, Larry struck out on his own, writing what would become “Weekends” over a summer in Brooklyn, and returning to Texas to collaborate with producer Beau Bedford (whose credits include work with the Apache 5, Dovetail and Kirby Brown). The four-track “Weekends” was released in Dec. 2011.“Weekends” showcases a strutting blend of funk, silky soul and smart pop melodies that become irresistibly lodged in your brain. Critics have called Larry’s music “finger-licking … enlivened soul music” (Pegasus News) and dared listeners “to find a single thing to hate” (Under the Gun). Larry has showcased his unique, intoxicating sound on stages from Los Angeles to New York City, with stops at South by Southwest, a stint on the Vans Warped Tour and high-profile slots opening for an array of national artists, including Ghostland Observatory and Linda Perry. He recently made his national television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Quite simply, “Weekends” heralds the arrival of a phenomenal talent, gearing up for a dynamic, exciting and artistically satisfying career, one as great and indelible as the artists he admires. The EP “Weekends” will give listeners a jolt – a burst of life-affirming, beautifully rendered music that evokes the past, even as it is firmly rooted in the present.via Facebook","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">Modern, yet timeless.

Peelander-Z is a “Japanese super-action comic band.” They seem to make fun of a Japanese style of music known as Visual Kei which consists of bands that are mainly men that mainly dress up as girls and 80’s hair bands. Visual Kei bands also make up stories such as being from the future. So Peelander-Z claims to be from planet Peelander section Z, and they claim that their costumes are actually their skin. Peelander’s live shows are really the band’s biggest draw. The band dresses in different costumes. Peelander Yellow has dressed as a banana and a yellow M&M, Peelander Red Usually wears an Indian headdress and a long robe with dragon wings on the back, and Peelander Blue wears boas and a championship wrestling belt. Audience participation is a must at Peelander-Z shows. Audience members are brought up to bang pots and shake tambourines during some songs. The band holds up cue cards which tell the audience what to yell back during the songs.

Produced by Sam Kassirer (Josh Ritter, Langhorne Slim), The Atlas was recorded in a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere Maine.

Consequently, Twin Berlin was launched into Comcast’s “On Demand” air time, and into rotation on Boston’s biggest indie/alternative radio station, WFNX.By 2010, Twin Berlin had broken out against the conventional indie-dance circuit, earning a reputation for a rabid, powerful live show. Garnering attention from the local press, Boston Music Spotlight named Twin Berlin as one of the eleven bands to watch for in 2011. They couldn’t have been any closer to the truth.While recording new material in the studio (2011) Mikey Welsh, formerly of the band Weezer, stepped in to create the cover art. But, before the recordings could even be finished, Travis Barker of Blink-182 became involved and selected Twin Berlin as the winner of Guitar Center’s “Your Next Record” competition, inviting them to record with him in Los Angeles.Twin Berlin released the much-anticipated There Goes My Virtue (produced by Barker) in February 2012. The EP features the single “Can’t Take, Take, Take” and was released to rave reviews with Audio Perv calling the release “three songs of energetic rock that fuels your soul, pinches your neck, kicks your ass and says ‘you’re welcome!’” The band continued to turn heads that summer catching the attention of Boston’s Radio 929 and being invited to play alongside Third Eye Blind, Spin Doctors, Switchfoot and Eve 6 at their Earthfest celebration at the Hatch Shell in Boston.With the calendar turning over to a new year Twin Berlin have hit the ground running.

MØ is spending the fall in the studio, wrapping up her highly anticipated debut album with Ronni Vindahl of Danish producer entity No Wav. Listeners can expect a lush, warm and soulful production, however MØ brings the Scandinavian cold/cool and a street vibe edge to the songs, which makes for a sonic juxtaposition. Her unique mix of indie, pop, hip-hop, electro and soul is hella fresh sounding and it genuinely sounds like MØ is fighting a battle of mixed emotions inside of herself. The Guardian named MØ ’band of the day’ and hailed her as ’the next Grimes’ and having played alongside acts such as Purity Ring and MS MR, it seems like MØ might just be the next indie act to break through to the mainstream masses. There is not much info out there on MØ who tends to let her music do the talking, but her facebook biography reveals a glimpse of her current state of mind: ”The snow nation is eating your brain and your young heart – dark as the apocalypse.

Some are better than others…some, not so much. So, when I sat down with my gigantic cup of coffee to have a listen to a submission, I was crossing my fingers for something decent. Of all times I have crossed my fingers, finally it paid off. Dreampop band, The Sea Life, even made me set down my coffee so I could fully enjoy them. The Sea Life bring forth their lo-fi pop sound in such a charming way. I chose to feature ‘Sleep’ off their self titled EP. I love it’s heart, it’s sweet, sweet heart. A song about losing sleep over someone you can’t have, I’m sure we can all relate. The Sea Life are relatable. As I listened to their EP, I was able to connect personally to each song. I think that’s what music is supposed to be all about, right? – DINGUS MUSIC The first track entitled “Sleep” will tempt you to do anything but. The instrumentals are light and airy, with a twang of passive vocals almost similar to the nonchalant style of Weezer, but perhaps the most apparent aspect of this album is the ease about it. The track list is as reminiscent of teenage life as it is an average indie album. It stirs up thoughts about those sleepless nights, going over every detail in your head about whatever it is that you may have messed up and whether or not you care at all. It reminds you of the time you gave up on that significant moment or person and when you finally realized to get back up and do something about it. Most importantly, it reminds you of the careless things you did because there was nothing better to do, no one holding you back or telling you to think twice, and the fun of spontaneity leading you onward. The Sea Life EP is a soundtrack for the young and carefree at heart. It’s for the sleepless dreamers and indecisive thinkers. Above all, it’s the sound of the new age, independent generation. – INDIEMUSICREVIEWER","<p>http://www.indiemusicreviewer.com/the-sea-life-self-titled-ep/</p> <p>We get daily submissions sent to Dingus and if you’re wondering, yes, I do listen to them.

Born from fire, raised on whiskey, and bonded by life, love and music, East Cameron Folkcore (ECF) is a collection of individual artists working for a common goal: to create music that resonates, that tells stories, and that speaks the truth. This 11-piece (or oftentimes more) band delivers songs of substance for the downtrodden and misunderstood outsiders of society. ECF performs authentic, American music at its most raw and simple definition: a blend of wide-ranging sounds combining folk, blues, rock, country, jazz, bluegrass and punk that articulates the varied background and influences of all the players. It is a sound that is as familiar as it is totally new to the ears, and it is all their own.In 2011, ECF released their debut LP, “Sound & Fury: Songs in the Key of Love and Death,” which nabbed them Album of the Year in the Austin Chronicle’s 2011 Critics Poll. In March of 2012, ECF was selected as an official artist of the SXSW Music Festival and built on that momentum by releasing “The Sun Also Rises” EP in May of that year. Though recorded at Sun Studios during the same sessions as the collective’s more somber debut, this EP offered the fast-paced, chaotic energy that has become synonymous with the band’s live performances. After capping off their tour in support of “The Sun Also Rises” with Free Press Summer Fest in Houston, ECF returned to the studio in the summer of 2012 with a blank canvas and came out with a record that is sonically and lyrically groundbreaking. Drawing heavy influence from self-introspection and the social and political upheaval that is brooding in the underbelly of the outskirts that is the underground of America, FOR SALE exposes a matured subject matter and writing style from multiple members, all layered through complex instrumentation and arrangements. Slated for release in February 2013, FOR SALE focuses on the lamentations and struggles of all the members, who, though growing older, still find themselves crippled by student loan debts, a choking economy, and a society and government that continuously labels them as outcasts.Stayed tuned for information regarding FOR SALE’s release party on February 8, 2013 at the Scottish Rite Theatre.Watch videos of East Cameron Folkcore playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!","<p><span><br><br>In the heavily over-saturated music scene of Austin, TX, a community of musicians formed in one North East neighborhood.

Robin creates a musical world for himself instinctively assimilating elements in response to his need to express himself while developing a perfect balance of Gypsy and Arab influences in his music. Long before the World Music trend exploded on the international scene, the Gypsy and Arab communities were open and encouraging Titi at a time when French mainstream music failed to move him musically or emotionally. The Gypsy and Arab community’ celebrations provided Robin with the opportunity to test his original music against these rich traditions from which he took his inspiration. Inspired by but never imitating, Robin obstinately looked for the best way to express himself as a contemporary artist while drawing on these rich musical cultures. Titi Robin Trio is the most open of Titi Robin’s lineups and is based on improvisation allowing each musician to play equally and meet each other on continuously renewed musical roads within Titi Robin’s repertoire. During performances, the three musicians alternate between soloists and backing interpreters. It relieves Robin from his usual leadership role and provides him with cherished musical freedom to explore new grounds. Thanks to the experience and musical knowledge of Francis and Ze, Titi is able to take risks and shine new light on his music.","<p>Titi Robin is a self-taught musician born in the late 1950s in Western France.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/akron-family","Akron/Family","Los Angeles, CA","folk, experimental, freak folk","Akron/Family is a folk-influenced experimental rock band that formed in 2002, and is currently based in New York. Though each member of the band — Miles Seaton, Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and formally Ryan Vanderhoof can be relegated to loosely defined roles (drummer, guitarist, bassist, vocalist), all of them in fact play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material. Live, the band uses improvisation and vocal harmonies in prominence. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel. In addition to their solo debut in 2005, the band played behind Michael Gira on his Angels of Light project as well as splitting a full length CD with Angels of Light. In 2006, the band released an EP, “Meek Warrior,” a collaboration with master drummer/hero Hamid Drake which contained both more traditional folk music and a pair of throbbing electric guitar monsters in “The Rider (Dolphin Song)” and the epic “Blessing Force,” which ends with an exploration into free jazz. Sometime between the completion of [2007 release] Love Is Simple and Akron/Family’s 2007 U.S. tour, Vanderhoof left Akron/Family to live in a Buddhist Dharma center in the Midwest. The band has also released several tour EPs featuring demos and other recordings. Listen at Last.fmProgressive/Gospel. The Independent :: San Francisco, CA by Dennis Cook Where does one begin when they’ve been happily shattered? What do you tell others after encountering something that splits you open and lets joy rummage around in your entrails before sewing you up with a grin? Evisceration isn’t always devastation. Sometimes the things that shake us from our comfort zone wake the dancer within and leave our hands sore from clapping ecclesiastically. When the bang of genuine creation blasts off the old skin and leaves us pink and disoriented there’s the drive to proselytize, and if ever there were a group worthy of shouted amens it’s Akron/Family. Please lord give me strength To be nobody ’Cause I am not my thoughts Thus began an evening that was more glorious, ramshackle rite than mere concert – a fierce, inordinately engaging bouillabaisse that drew flavor from classic rock, experimental jazz, church music of every continent, the slink of ’60s and ’70s Nigerian and Ethiopian music, tribal drumming, folk forms and more. In print it may seem too eclectic to really coalesce, but Akron/Family loves music in the archetypal sense – song and melody and dissonance and harmony. They draw no borders or accept any common limitations. They make music in a holistically cosmic, transcendental way, and those who left their genre hang-ups at the door discovered a delightful, free spirited ensemble that strived with all their might to make you love music and performance as much as they do. This Family is built around the core trio of Seth Olinsky (vocals, guitars, percussion), Miles Seaton (vocals, bass, guitar, percussion) and Dana Janssen (drums, vocals, misc.). Original fourth member Ryan Vanderhoof left the band to pursue a life off the road earlier this year, allowing the remaining guys to expand the lineup into a seven-headed freak machine that includes all of North Carolina’s Megafaun – Joe Westerlund (drums, vocals), Brad Cook (bass, guitar, vocals) and Phil Cook (keys, banjo, percussion, vocals) – and Greg Davis (guitar, electronics, vocals). Collectively, I’m pretty sure there’s no type of music they couldn’t play credibly, such is their determination, innate skill and empathetic group mojo. One always felt in confident hands despite the freewheeling character of some sections. To look at them, you’d see a bunch of pretty regular looking guys but put instruments in their hands, crank the PA (they do like it LOUD!) and you’ll see them sweat off some of the natural inhibitions that keep human beings from evolving. Watching them leap and cavort in SF, one felt part of some beautiful cataclysm that precedes growth. Akron/Family invited (and in a few instances, demanded) we come go with them into the great wide open. While participation isn’t mandatory (yay free will!) you missed out on a crucial element in the A/F experience if you restrained your muscles from twitching in time. Whether your mind agreed or not, your body will respond instinctively to their fluctuations. More than once I found my eyes had shut and my body continued gyrating, drawn ever closer to the flame they stoked onstage. To be moved in body as well as mind is a rare feat and one Akron/Family pulled off repeatedly. While impossible to fully sketch the journey they took us on, it’s worth noting the twists and curves of the first furlong. An almost imperceptible rise occurs, where the refrain quoted above (from “Franny” off their self-titled 2005 debut) swims through a slowly unfolding series of undulating crescendos, dwindles to just human voices and then explodes into a percussion barrage where every man onstage held a bodhran, tambourine, maraca or other manner of stretched skin and wood while their massed voices offered a sea shanty for travels in the Milky Way. This moved into molten guitar froth – what one imagines the many limbed wrangling of Sonny Sharrock and Phil Manzanera (Roxy Music) might sound like – that shifted seamlessly into a math rock display that’d draw a smile from the most hard line Tortoise fan, only to left turn into a brief pastoral pop coda. This sprawling, yet ever-successful surge was followed by a piece that suggested a squanky version of Neil Young’s After The Gold Rush period and then a sweaty funk-a-thon that mashed up Chic and the Butterfield Blues Band under the Akron mortar and pestle. The power of their vocals was undeniable, a roughhewn men’s choir capable of both indescribable sweetness and Beefheartian wackiness. No one seemed overly concerned at playing the fool at times if it served their purposes or seemed right in the moment – a stance prevalent in all their moves. Many of their lyrics have a simple, finely crafted philosophical bent that gained force with repetition. Hearing the band and majority of the audience softly repeat, “There’s so many colors without the dirty windows,” had the power of early ‘70s Van Morrison, where he rattled breathlessly about “the love that loves the love that loves.” In fact, there’s much of vintage Van’s otherworldly gorgeousness to Akron/Family, who presently make records as soulfully nourishing as Astral Weeks and His Band And Street Choir, particularly the album they’re currently touring, Love Is Simple (released September 18 on Young God Records). So complex, so multifaceted are many of Love’s cuts that I was skeptical about their ability to pull them off live but jumpin’ Jiminy Cricket they did so with jaw dropping success in SF. Notably, the sprawling, drum-driven “Ed Is A Portal” (complete with half naked hip-hop breakdown) served as the cherry bursting with holy rollin’ flavor at the end of the main set, which also included a barnstorming James Brown-esque cover of Grateful Dead staples “Lovelight” (led in shirtless abandon by Seaton) and a movingly delicate encore of “I Know You Rider” full of shivering vocals and a badass banjo solo. Akron/Family is writing a 21st century non-denominational hymnal, free of any New Age stink or hippie laziness. What they did in San Francisco was tap into the great currents of the universe and share that energy and unfiltered beauty with us. Their constant desire to obliterate the line between audience/consumer and performer/musician shares something with the Dead, Phish and others who’ve introduced participatory elements into the mix. However, those bands rarely gave so freely or vigorously to those who stood before them. Akron/Family are a very special band and you cheat yourself with every minute you wait to wade into their waters.","<p>Akron/Family is a folk-influenced experimental rock band that formed in 2002, and is currently based in New York.</p> Though each member of the band — Miles Seaton, Seth Olinsky, Dana Janssen and formally Ryan Vanderhoof can be relegated to loosely defined roles (drummer, guitarist, bassist, vocalist), all of them in fact play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material.

Her first album, “Distillation”, arrived a decade ago to high praise and signaled the debut of singular talent. It has been followed by 7 full length albums, 3 EPs, an upcoming concert film, and a groundbreaking internet concert series. From elegant pop to balls-out rock, sweet electronics to witty swing, Erin has packed a ton of music into a substantial career. Raised in Fredericksburg, VA, Erin began playing piano at age 3. At age 12 she picked up the electric guitar, learning to play by ear, from friends, and with her trusty Tascam 4-track recorder. She wrote her first songs shortly thereafter. During her time at Brown University, Erin added the mandolin, banjo, and bass to her instrumental arsenal. In her early 20’s, she added the kit drums. For most of the last decade, Erin has spent an average of 200 nights a year onstage, building a loyal fan base across the United States and Europe. She has appeared on Later with Jools Holland, Late Night with Conan O’Brien, NPR, BBC, and has had numerous film, television, and commercial placements. In the last year, she’s taken more time off the road to teach, write poems and op-eds, and launch a successful side-career as a political activist, lobbying regularly on Capitol Hill about issues concerning musicians and technology. In the summer of 2009, Erin created “Cabin Fever”, a live internet concert series broadcast from her picturesque cabin in rural western Massachusetts. Described as “Wayne’s World meets the Judy Garland Show”, the series has garnered considerable attention for its entertaining exploration of the intersections of art, technology, and commerce. You can watch the entire series here. Erin’s latest studio album is “Hundreds of Lions”, produced by Sam Kassirer and out now on Righteous Babe Records. “Live At Lincoln Hall”, a concert film recorded to celebrate Erin’s first decade in music, will be released in late spring 2011. McKeown is currently working on a book of poems, looking for ways to incorporate her love of sports into her career, and writing her next studio project- due in early 2012. She is also available for co-writing and album production work.

Probably a question most of you have asked yourselves in the last 37 seconds, and rightfully so. With that in mind, here’s the skinny: I’m a 24-year-old musician, a passionate environmentalist and a harmless mischief maker. I love comfortable clothing, high fives, cool hats, good beer, good people, and I am terribly addicted to fantasy baseball. I have been writing music for about six years, and studying voice for about the same. I’ve proudly played in a Mariachi band, performed in an a capella group, and crooned for a sixteen piece big band. I’m pretty sure that I am a better singer than guitarist. I am an only child. I have a legendary patch of hair on my back known as “The Man Patch.” I frequently disclose too much information about myself. :) Neoteny is my debut album and is a true reflection of my personality, song writing, and aspirations. My hope is that the album takes you all on an adventure through the depths of my mind. I try to touch on experiences from my life that I think everyone can relate to and then introduce you to characters that have emerged through my mischievous nature and sometimes strange imagination. The Collective is how I support myself as an independent musician. Essentially, it’s a community of my most loyal fans who purchase a “Partnership” in The Collective in return for free music, free shows, free merchandise, and a voice in the major decisions I make. Partners have access to a password protected part of my website where I post exclusive music and video, and where they can vote on big questions like “what should the order of my album be?” or “where should I tour?”. Pretty cool, ey? Well, that’s it for now. Take a listen and let me know what you think. Your feedback is both what keeps me going and keeps me on toes!","<p>So who the f#*k is Jamie Kent?

The Sun Parade grew out of the creative realm spawned by Elliot Smith and Deer Tick. Chris Marlon Jennings and Jefferson Lewis share frontman duties with intricate guitar work accentuated by harmonies that could only be produced by longtime friends blessed with both the vocal range of Jeff Buckley and impeccable texture of The Zombies. The young, raw talent found in twenty year old Chris’s writing is self-described as “emotions that are played out in music”. Theseemotions are especially evident in the hit single “Need You By My Side”, which has risen to the top of regional radio charts in New England and has been declared the “Top Song of 2011” by WRSI 93.9 and 101.5, ahead of notable national acts (Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver, Beirut-amongst many others). Link to Top Songs of 2011. Recent appearances have included sharing the stage with Martin Sexton, Rufus Wainwright and Sonya Kitchell at venues such as The Webster Theater in Hartford, Middle East in Boston, Iron Horse in Northampton MA, The Bitter End and Rockwood Music Hall in New York City and also include being featured at the Plant & Sing festival in The Hamptons, NY and the Green River Festival in Greenfield, MA. The Sun Parade is a band poised to make moves. Their youthful energy paired with an eclectic polished sound will be sure to captivate your audience now and leave them bragging for years to come about where they were when they first saw The Sun Parade.","<p>Folk / Folk Rock / Indie<div><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); "">The Sun Parade, A Massachusetts Based indie rock/ folk pop duo</span> <span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); "">embarking on a tour to South by Southwest to showcase their new</span><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); "">eponymous full-length album.</span><br><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); ""> The Sun Parade grew out of the creative realm spawned by Elliot Smith</span> <span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.917969); "">and Deer Tick.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/crystal-bright","Crystal Bright","Greensboro","","Out in the woods she lived, all alone. At least that’s what it felt like, never belonging to any one group and having a penchant for the oppressed. Crystal did not come from a musical family, and unlike so many children who are forced into music lessons, at age seven she practically ran away to her piano teacher’s house down the street – books in her basket – pedaling as fast as she could down the gravel road – dust flying behind. When she was still young, a little demon told her that she shouldn’t sing, that it sounded better when she just played the piano, but she was determined to ignore the demon and sing her heart out anyway. But sometimes the influence of the demon rendered her silent and still, and her hands seemed to be void of life. As she grew up she traveled the world, dancing with the Romani people of Spain, residing in an “anarchist” collective, working in Yellowstone, and above all else learning about other cultures and their music. It was in Greensboro, NC in 2010 that she met what would become her first Silver Hand. Diego Diaz had witnessed her previous band that took him to another time and place, and he wished to contribute his haunting and ethereal guitar sounds. It was around this time that Crystal’s hands began to grow back. She began writing her own music again, and in less than a year collaborated with the North Carolina Symphony on an arrangement of her song “Toy Hammer” for their 2010 New Year’s Eve program at Meymandi Concert Hall in Raleigh. She is constantly performing, has had two Northeast tours and has played alongside Holy Ghost Tent Revival, Larkin Grimm, Pearl and the Beard and many more. “Muses and Bones,” her second album, will cast you into an otherwordly, ethereal, hauntingly familiar yet strange landscape, ranging from deranged Cirque du Soleil to burlesque European Carnival. Within Crystal’s unconventional song structures, you’ll hear her inspiration from P.J. Harvey and Björk, and a deep love for Yann Tiersen and the Gotan Project. Her lyrics and melodies portray the world as a dark and strange (and often funny) place deeply connected to fables and imagination. Stories such as “Little Match Girl” and “Skeleton Woman” convey folklore lessons that address phases in women’s lives where they need to be conscious of staying true to their intuition. Songwriting begins in many different ways, including inspiration from refrigerator magnet poetry or going to the movies alone at midnight, but is mostly a channeling process that happens late at night when the veil between reality and dreams is the thinnest. Expect the unexpected. Crystal’s songs reflect her educational background in Anthropology and Ethnomusicology and her experiences playing and singing various styles – Mariachi, Chinese, Balinese Gamelan, Ugandan, Samba and more. She is a mad multi-tasker who jumps around on accordion, musical saw (self-taught through YouTube videos), piano, adungu (a Ugandan harp), concertina and bombo (Argentine drum) – sometimes more than one at a time! She possesses astounding vocal range and power that descends on a dime to delicate subtlety. One moment she sings, she soars – and the next… a falsetto whisper that slyly peeks behind the curtain. Many Silver Hands have come and gone on various instruments. These days Sandy Blocker, whom Crystal met as her African drumming teacher 11 years ago, contributes African, Middle Eastern, and South American rhythms by adding riqq, jembe and congas, alongside kick drum and cymbals. Another Silver Hand is the exquisitely tasteful Jeremy Denman from the hip-hop group Urban Sophisticates on trumpet. Crystal desires to collaborate with other artists in all areas of media and believes strongly that arts have the power to create community and heal.","Out in the woods she lived, all alone.

Led by the incomparable singer and songwriter Paul Rodgers, arguably the finest singer in rock ’n ’ roll and a huge songwriting talent. Formed in 1973, Bad Company came to life when Rodgers was looking to start anew after the disintegration of his legendary band Free. His powerhouse vocals and songwriting were a main ingredient during Free’s impressive five-year run; a period of time that saw the release of seven extremely influential albums that featured Free’s minimalist blues-rock approach. Included among Free’s dynamic body of work is the 1970 smash, “All Right Now,” one of the most recognizable rock anthems ever recorded. Lyrics and melody by Rodgers. He was Free’s main songwriter. Rodgers had met Mott The Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and after jamming together and listening to new songs that Ralphs had penned and songs that Rodgers had penned, Ralphs made the decision to leave Mott and form a new band with Rodgers. The duo recruited former King Crimson bassist/vocalist Boz Burrell, added drummer Simon Kirke and christened themselves Bad Company, the name inspired by Rodgers. Rodgers’ brought in Led Zeppelin manager Peter Grant and Bad Company became the first band signed to Zeppelin’s Swan Song label. “I had to fight to get the management and the record company to accept the name Bad Company,” explains Rodgers. “They thought it was a terrible name. Peter Grant called a meeting and the band met beforehand. I told them that I had been through this before with Free as Island Records had wanted to call us the Heavy Metal Kids. We agreed to go in and tell them that we were going to be called Bad Company and that was the end of the story. As soon as Peter heard how strongly I felt about the name, he became very supportive and he and I turned the record company around.”","<p>One of the most acclaimed bands of the classic rock era, England’s Bad Company has put its indelible stamp on rock ‘n’ roll with a straight-ahead, no-frills musical approach that has resulted in the creation of some of the most timeless rock anthems ever.

After a couple of years of gigging in England and Norway, they released their epynomously named debut album in 1993, which quickly went gold in their home country and reached the top of the Irish imports chart.

He plays music this like he lives life and it sounds like Andrew WK meets Grand Master Melle Mel or Like Prince if he couldn’t sing that well and if he weren’t a hyper-talented multi-instrumentalist. This is what his music is all about: part epicurean hip-hop-dance songs and part sincere dance rock songs, being eclectic and catchy is the only goal. “God Loves Drunk Chicks” is a infectious dance ditty lamenting date rape culture and “Just Push Play” is a witty indictment of “the next big thing” trend in the music industry and pop culture in general. His debut album Choose Your Perversion came out in 2007 His new album Songs in the Key of Magic just came out this spring on Roaring Colonel Records This is rap but not necessarily hip-hop. It rocks but it’s not rap-rock. These songs are meaningful party songs but maximized! Andy D bends the genres but his influences are pretty apparent. And people take notice where ever he goes. From rapping about having sex with Werewolves to singing about knife fights in a roller rink, no subject is taboo in an Andy D song; and he gets raunchy with it. Half of the fun of Andy D is hearing what he will say next… the other half is dancing.

Less than a year later, there was a full-length in the can. That album, Hampton’s Lullaby, garnered praise for its Appalachian harmonies and ethereal melodies. The band toured, and continues to tour in 2011, in support of that collection of songs, as well as in anticipation of two spring releases. The first, Via Flamina, a four song collection of new originals and inspired covers, dropped on April Fools Day via multiple formats. Only a few weeks later, on April 19th, Autumn Tone Records released a re-mastered version of the original EP. Sooner than later, Athens’ own up-and-coming label, Holy Owned Subsidiary, will offer the EP on One Hundred and Fifty Gram vinyl in a package featuring art hand-fashioned by the band. Only Four Hundred copies will be available. During May and June, the band will support Grace Potter on the Bonnaroo Buzz Tour and perform at Bonnaroo, as well as tour with Drive-By Truckers and headline AthFest 2011. The band hopes to find your face in the crowd. Daniel Lanois’ Black Dub (featuring Trixie Whitley and Brian Blade) Black Dub is the latest project from acclaimed musician and producer Daniel Lanois, a legendary guitarist and composer who has produced seminal albums for U2, Bob Dylan, Brian Eno, Willie Nelson and Neil Young. Lanois is what historians like to call a musician’s musician. In Lanois’ own words… Black Dub is essentially a three-piece band with a high level of musicianship. We don’t operate on a technological grid. Nor are we tied to a page of fixed notes. Our songs are fluid. Often recorded live. One take. No overdubs. It’s a very old fashioned idea really. I think that might be why we get such a strong response on YouTube. Each video we create is a live musical performance shot with a hand-held camera seen through the eyes of one individual. No cuts. No edits. It’s clear that people still have an appetite for something honest and authentic with real musicians playing live. In these sad times of prepackaged music, people yearn to experience something soulful, heartfelt, something meaningful. As simple as it sounds, real music is a rare commodity these days. Our first CD is very real – kind of a rock thing, steeped in the Jamaican culture of dub, which I love. On a good day, I see myself carrying the torch of [famed Jamaican producer] Lee Scratch Perry. I wrote this music from a dub perspective, which I believe is very soulful. What do I mean by soul? Soul music is a music that needs to exist, for the right reasons, beyond business preconceptions – natural reasons that resonate deep inside. I think this band has it. Whether we’re playing at a club or in the studio, at our best, there is something breathless and spontaneous going on here. On Brian Blade… Every stroke of Brian Blade’s drumming has church in it. This man grew up in the band at his father’s Baptist church in Shreveport, Louisiana, so he’s been serving singers all his life. A gospel choir is a mighty force and you can’t serve that kind of singing if you are a fake with a big ego. This is music that demands respect and humility. That’s what makes Brian’s playing so pure and free. In addition, Brian honed his skills studying with New Orleans masters Ellis Marsalis, David Lee, Jr. Bill Huntington, Mike Pellera, George French, Germaine Bazzle, Steve Masakowski and John Mahoney. As a drummer, Brian is a true original, so inventive he never plays the same thing twice. Don’t take my word for it. Ask jazz stars like Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Joshua Redman and Bill Frisell, with whom Brian has also worked. Or songwriters like Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Seal and Nora Jones. Plus, Brian recorded several albums with his own bands, the Brian Blade Fellowship and Perceptual, as well as a solo album that came out last year. On Trixie Whitley… Trixie Whitley is an amazing singer with such a strong sense of commitment in her voice. She grew up on Etta James and the classic soul singers. Talk about soul. She’s got it, in her blood. Trixie comes from a family of musicians in Texas and New Orleans – her father being the late great blues singer Chris Whitley, a friend who I was lucky enough to work with many years ago. Trixie is young and full of fire: the voice of a generation. Words from the songstress herself… Black Dub is made up of many ingredients, but all the ingredients come from the same place: the soul. To me, soul music isn’t just Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye. It’s Joni Mitchell too. It comes from a deep emotional place inside you. It’s pretty much the opposite of the comfy fast food approach to culture. It’s about what touches you, what penetrates your heart. It’s about how you work with what your soul responds to most. Discovering the lighter side of Black Dub according to Blade… Dan writes some heavy music, both instrumentally and lyrically. He writes from the heart, the mystery of the heart. That mystery from which our deepest feelings and secrets unfold: love and loss, joy and hope, fear and darkness. The name Black Dub may sound dark, but Dan always keeps a light on. An evolutionary perspective from Lanois… You know how every now and then you witness an impossible stroke of Mother Nature? Say, for instance, you’re looking up at some huge concrete bridge and you notice a tiny, delicate vine sprouting through the structure. Maybe a seed got stuck in a crack. The power in that little bud will eventually erupt into a labyrinth of vines across the bridge. If you tried to plan out something like that you couldn’t pull it off. But there it is, before your eyes, something magical just bursts into existence for natural reasons. As a musician, I look for those little seeds that catch on their own. Spotting is what I call it. For me, music is not about inventing something from scratch. It’s about expanding on something that has a natural beginning. A flash of a moment that has something special about it. I like to flirt with such natural diversions. Oftentimes they can grow into something quite substantial. I had the good fortune recently to visit Brian’s father’s church and sit in with the band. They were so many superb singers in that choir, real natural down-to-earth people with regular jobs who could out-sing practically any star in the music business. I so admire musicians like them. The way they see it, their singing, their voices belong to the community. They don’t sing for money. For members of that choir, singing is about praise. I’m not much of a churchgoer, but I think of music as praise too. I think of God as a great molecular collective. If you’re trying to do good and you come to the end of each day having made a few improvements in your life, not necessarily monetarily, but spiritually, I think that’s godliness. I like that about Black Dub. It’s a collective. Without a doubt the people in this band embrace the same values. We are made of the same fiber, personally and philosophically. And in the end, I see that as the overriding ingredient of Black Dub. Beyond entertainment, beyond commerce, it is the fiber of our music. And that’s enough for us.Watch videos of Futurebirds playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!","<p>Covered in kudzu and swathed in a blanket of humidity, spanish moss, feedback and reverb exists Futurebirds; six Georgia natives who currently call Athens “home.” In 2009, these folks self-produced and released the six song Futurebirds EP—one of undeniable character.

And in the end, I see that as the overriding ingredient of Black Dub. Beyond entertainment, beyond commerce, it is the fiber of our music.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/teen","Teen","Toronto","origem desconhecida","Since 2002, TEEN’s lead singer/songwriter, Teeny Lieberson, has been playing in bands around New York City, eventually becoming the keyboard player for the indie-psych band Here We Go Magic in 2008. During a hiatus from the band in the winter of 2009, Teeny wrote a five-song EP Little Doods, the foundation of TEEN’s full-length, In Limbo. Working with many of the songs written that winter with the desire to expand the sound from four-track/lo-fi to a fully flushed out sound, Teeny recruited her sisters, Lizzie and Katherine, along with long- time friend, Jane Herships and best friend since childhood, Maia Ibar, to become members of TEEN. TEEN spent the summer of 2011 recording In Limbo in Maia’s family barn in rural Connecticut, engineered by Jen Turner of Here We Go Magic. In Limbo was mixed and produced in collaboration with producer Pete Kember (Spacemen 3 / Spectrum). Kember, a.k.a. Sonic Boom, first heard the band via an early video while he was mixing Panda Bear’s Tomboy at Blanker Unsinn studio in Brooklyn, and after hearing some demos, signed up to produce a full LP of their material as soon as possible. The band decided their best move was to record the LP in the back country atmosphere of Connecticut, with the recording and initial mixes starting there. Further work was done at MGMT’s Blanker Unsinn facility with the final mixing and mastering taking place in the UK at Sonic Boom’s New Atlantis Studio. TEEN’s sound relies heavily on its vocal arrangements and harmonies. The music is strengthened by the flawless vocal connections between family and friends. The songs on the album are a reflection of change and loss – loss of loved ones, loss of relationships and sitting in the space of the unknown – in limbo. They reflect on how times such as these can give birth to powerful creative moments, and also solidify bonds in relationships between friends and family. The songs are mysterious and dark, exploring the many sensitivities and emotions that a person endures during these critical and life-changing experiences. The band have played consistently since Winter 2010, including performances with Purity Ring, War on Drugs and Yellow Ostrich and most recently, Ariel Pink, Santigold, Frankie Rose, Dean Wareheim and Hospitality.

In July 2008, the band released Feels Good, followed by the EP, The last one Standing, released in May 2010 after Madame Scorpio battled Breast Cancer.

Its a lovely meeting of old and new sounds where rootsy folk meets post rock"" -Road Records "" A brooding, rich sound of acoustic guitars, subtle keyboard and husky vocals make for some haunting listening. autumn owls are utterly absorbing, 7/10"" -Channel 4 Planet Sound "" At their core they’re acoustic based americana tunes and come with all the accoutrements attached to that label; harmonicas, the sound of plectrums being dragged along guitar strings, and whatnot but what really makes them work is how they’re wrapped up in droney synths, melodicas and ambient guitar noise"" -Thrill Pier "" These four young Dubliners have enormous potential. Some of it is a bit like Nick Drake’s older brother singing for an experimental Wilco. Other parts are unique. It’s subtle and interesting, and despite the complicated song structures they don’t get too self-indulgent .

After moving to Los Angeles in September 2004, Pander gained national recognition from his first appearance on the Dr. Phil Show. The segment entitled, ""Real Talent,"" discussed what it takes to make it in Hollywood.

One hot summer day, he followed a melancholy tune. The song led him to a homeless man strumming his old guitar on the corner. Shawn strolled up and asked him his name. "" I'm James,"" the man said. ""What do you think of my music?"" Shawn nodded and smiled his approval. James asked if he liked jazz and the blues. With a shrug, Shawn said, ""I don't know. Do I?"" An instant bond was formed, and Shawn came back to visit James and learn guitar everyday that summer. In the dead heat of August, his dad was laid off, and told Shawn it was his last day to come to the car lot. Sad to say goodbye, Shawn told James he couldn't come around anymore.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/steve-poltz-and-the-rugburns","Steve Poltz and the Rugburns","","","Steve Poltz & The Rugburns consists of gifted singer/songwriter Steve Poltz, bassist Gregory Page, guitarist “Dr.” Robert Driscoll, and drummer Jeff “Stinky” Aafedt, who was at one time a member of the band Forbidden Pigs. Poltz and Driscoll, longtime friends from the San Diego area, formed the original group, who stayed a duo for years before they added Aafedt and Page to make it a terrific foursome. There were other members at some points in the life of the band, like John Castro and James Castro. The Rugburns played acoustic music in coffeehouses in San Diego for nearly a decade before branching out to bigger dreams. The group played music from artists like James Taylor at first, but changed gears and began performing unabashed rock, a lot of it written by Poltz. The band’s new slow-speed metal sound was compared to that of the Beat Farmers and the Pleasure Barons. In 1992, the Rugburns signed with the Bizarre/Planet Records label. It took almost two years before a debut album was available. The album, Morning Wood, carries tracks like “I Want to Learn About Love,” “Kilkenny Man,” and the humorous “My Carphone’s on the Pill.” After the successful debut, the Rugburns toured a lot to promote the album. The band’s live seditious performances gained them word-of-mouth fame. In 1995, a second offering hit the stores, Taking the World By Donkey, recorded under the Priority Records label. “Girl With the Wandering Eye” and “Better Be Careful” are a couple of the tunes on the subsequent album. There is also one EP, Mommy I’m Sorry.","<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 14px;"">Steve Poltz & </span><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 14px;"">The Rugburns consists of gifted singer/songwriter Steve Poltz, bassist Gregory Page, guitarist “Dr.” Robert Driscoll, and drummer Jeff “Stinky” Aafedt, who was at one time a member of the band Forbidden Pigs. </span><br><br><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 14px;"">Poltz and Driscoll, longtime friends from the San Diego area, formed the original group, who stayed a duo for years before they added Aafedt and Page to make it a terrific foursome.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/mishka","Mishka","Oceans & Seas","","Mishka’s biography has an almost cinematic sweep. He spent most of his early life on a boat in the Caribbean, sailing from island to island with his seafaring parents and older sisters. A child of the islands, it was almost inevitable that he’d be drawn to reggae, Rastafari, and the natural mystic that inhabits his music and his soul. Above The Bones is his third album and the debut release for Matthew McConaughey’s j. k. livin label. “The music I heard growing up from my parents, sisters and the places we visited gave me a lot of musical and cultural flexibility.” “Everything I’ve ever heard blends together in what I do.” “I’m a huge reggae fan but there’s folk, soul, rock and other elements in the music.” Mishka’s international outlook is a product of his unique upbringing. “My parents met in Bermuda” Mishka explains. “They always had dreams of living at sea and my father built a boat for the family to live on. I moved onto the boat when I was three.” “We sailed all over the Atlantic and Caribbean” Mishka recalls. “We visited Brazil, all the Caribbean islands, even made a cross-Atlantic trip to Portugal and England.” Mishka and his sisters were home schooled until they went to boarding school for their higher education. “Learning how to read maps and chart a course was my math and geography class, going ashore in different countries and talking to people about their culture was my history class, reading books on board was my literary education, picking up French and Portuguese in the ports we visited was my language school.” The boat had a small battery run cassette player and Mishka heard the music his parents loved: The Beatles, Jimmy Cliff, Dylan and Jimmy Buffett who was sailing the same waters as his family in those days. “My sisters turned me on to the Police, Cars and Roxy Music, but when I heard Burning Spear, Culture, and Bob Marley, I got addicted to roots reggae.” Mishka moved to London and his debut, the self-titled Mishka, became a Top 40 hit in England. “Give You All the Love” cracked the charts in Britain and Japan where it went Top 10. While he was making Mishka, Swedish producer Martin Terefe (KT Tunstall, James Morrison) was working in the studio next door. Terefe produced Mishka’s second album, 2005’s One Tree, a blend of electronica, folk and reggae. While on tour, Mishka met Darryl Thompson a long time guitarist for Sly & Robbie. They were working on Above the Bones when Matthew McConaughey showed up and signed Mishka to his new label j. k. livin. Mishka’s varied musical interests are evident on Above the Bones but his vocals may be the most captivating element of the album. His striking tenor is mellow and intense with a bluesy quality that gives every word an aching intensity. It’s a timeless voice, the familiar sound of a friend you’ve always known but never met. “Higher Heights” opens the album with a roots reggae vibe. It’s a song of empowerment and encouragement to people who want to see more love and unity in the world, an invitation to let our better nature shine and heal the troubled world we live in. “3rd Eye Vision” is a rock steady groove. It’s a prayer for the planet that urges us to live in harmony with the earth and find peace of mind amidst a system that often forces us to be hypocritical to ourselves. “Peace and Love” is a simple three chord celebration of eternal values. Mishka’s vocal is full of sweet soulful fire. The title track for the album is essentially a folk song about honoring our ancestors, their memories, their tribulations and their joys and translating that into a prayer for the living. Other stand out tracks include “Coastline Journey” with laid back conga lines and surfer style guitar licks this one is essentially a love song for the ocean; “Mountains Meet the Sea” a tender rock ballad and “Train Again” a tune that brings to mind the early Wailers with its funky Clavinet and rock guitar leads also features vocals by dancehall artist Lyrical Don. The album started as an independent project produced by Mishka and Guitarist Darryl Thompson but was finished with the creative assistance of Matthew McConaughey. It was essentially tracked live with minimal overdubs. “Darryl has played for many years with Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru, but he has a background mainly in rock and blues” Mishka says of Darryl. “He could hear the folk, soul and reggae in the music and really helped bring the songs to life”. “Matthew (McConaughey) has a good ear for picking out the best elements of a song and really brought his positive energy and enthusiasm to the studio.” With an album that fully realizes his multifaceted musical vision, Mishka and his band will take to the road, sharing his positive vibrations and his global musical vision with fans old and new.","<p>Mishka’s biography has an almost cinematic sweep.

Incorporating years of violin training and a degree in ethnomusicology, Greene’s dark string arrangements and melancholy vocals generate a unique blend of organic sonic elements. Jessy’s most recent solo record, A Demon and Her Lovers, chronicles her journey around the world as a woman whose life was saved by music. As a teenage runaway bound for L.A., Greene left her small hometown and was accepted into UCLA on the merit of her audition. Since then, having lived on both coasts, as well as the Midwest, she’s toured internationally as a musician, collaborating with world-class talent. In addition to her solo albums, Jessy has played violin with an array of diverse artists such as Foo Fighters, Wilco, Atmosphere, Soul Asylum, Dessa of Doomtree, The Jayhawks, P.O.S, and Romantica. In the summer of 2007, Jessy joined the Foo Fighters on a stunning two-year tour as their violinist, cellist and background singer. On break from the Foo Fighters, Jessy played in a 10-piece string section with P!NK at the 2008 American Music Awards. She was then asked to tour as P!NK’s only string player on her 2009 record-breaking Fun House Tour. The year 2010 has been an opportunity for Jessy to play and collaborate with amazing musicians. In January, Jessy was in the studio recording with Joseph Arthur, Ben Harper & Dhani Harrison for their highly-acclaimed new project, Fistful of Mercy. Greene is currently at work in the studio with the Foo Fighters who have begun their follow-up record to 2007’s phenomenal “Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace.”","<p>Jessy Greene, a multi-instrumentalist singer/songwriter, started playing violin as a four-year old prodigy from Sheffield, Massachusetts who spent her formative years studying as a classical Suzuki violinist.</p> <p>Incorporating years of violin training and a degree in ethnomusicology, Greene’s dark string arrangements and melancholy vocals generate a unique blend of organic sonic elements.</p> <p>Jessy’s most recent solo record, A Demon and Her Lovers, chronicles her journey around the world as a woman whose life was saved by music.

Blakley’s first soundtrack was composed for the 20th Century Fox Film “Welcome Home Soldier Boys” and earned her a spot in “Who’s Who in America.” In 1972, the folk-rock album “Ronee Blakley” debuted on Elektra Records. The album featured Blakley’s original songs, accompanied by her talent on the piano. Blakley also made the musical arrangements. The song “Bluebird” featured a duet with Linda Rondstat. Ronee’s songs were published by her own company, Sawtooth Music. Blakley’s second album, “Welcome” was released on Warner Bros. in 1975. It was produced by Jerry Wexler and recorded at the legendary Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama. The Los Angeles Herald Examiner wrote it was a “near perfect album.” Blakley is probably most widely known now for her brilliant performance as country superstar Barbara Jean in Robert Altman’s 1975 film “Nashville (film). The character Barbara Jean was purported to be modeled after country star Loretta Lynn. In “Nashville” Blakley performs her own songs in character, including “Tapedeck In His Tractor,” “Dues” and “My Idaho Home.” In her famous review for The New Yorker, film critic Pauline Kael wrote: “This is Ronee Blakley’s first movie, and she puts most movie hysteria to shame. She achieves her gifts so simply, I wasn’t surprised when somebody sitting beside me started to cry. Perhaps, for the first time on the screen, one gets the sense of an artist being destroyed by her gifts.” Blakley was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Best Supporting Actress along with Lily Tomlin (who was also nominated in the same category). Blakley was also nominated for Grammy, Golden Globes and British Academy Awards, and won the National Board of Review award for Best Supporting Actress. Ronee was featured on the covers of Newsweek, American Cinematographer and Andy Warhols Interview Magazine. Throughout her career, Blakley has worked with some of the top directors: Walter Hill in ""The Driver, Wes Craven in “A Nightmare on Elm Street” and Bob Dylan in “Renaldo and Clara.” She performed a duet with Dylan on the epic “Hurricane” from his Desire album and toured with him on the Rolling Thunder Review, also featuring Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott. She also recorded with Leonard Cohen and Hoyt Axton. Blakley starred in several TV movies: “Desperate Women,” “Ladies in Waiting,” “Oklahoma City Dolls” and the “Ford 75th Anniversary Special” introduced by Tennessee Williams and co-starring John Ritter in “The Glass Menagerie.” Her guest starring roles include “Vegas,” “The Love Boat,” “Highway to Heaven,” Trapper John,"" “Hotel,” “The Runaways,” “Beyond Westworld” and “Tales from the Darkside.” In 1977, she starred in the film “She Came to the Valley” with Dean Stockwell and Scott Glenn, and Freddie Fender. In 1980, Ronee starred in “The Baltimore Bullet” with James Coburn, Omar Sharif and Bruce Boxleitner. In 1982 Ronee set house records on Broadway in “Pump Boys and Dinettes” with Loudon Wainwright III and starred Off Broadway with Tammy Grimes in 1983. She starred in Somerset Maughm’s “Rain” for the Indiana Repertory Theater. In 1985, she produced, wrote, starred in, and directed her own feature music docudrama titled “I Played It for You” which debuted at the Venice Film Festival and has appeared at several other festivals worldwide, including a recent screening at the Silver Lake Film Festival. Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times called “I Played It For You” “passionate and brave, an absorbing work.” FX Feeney of the LA Weekly called it “a valuable document.” In 2008 Blakley released the film “I Played It for You” on DVD, bundled with the soundtrack on CD, and a new spoken word poetry album titled “Freespeak.” All are available through her website. “Lightning Over Water,” Ronee’s soundtrack for the Wim Wenders/Nicholas Ray film in which she also appeared, is set for release in 2008 as is a new album, “Ronee Blakley Live at the Mint.”","<p>Ronee Blakley (born August 24, 1945) is an Academy Award-nominated American actress, singer, songwriter, composer, producer, and director.</p> <p>Blakley’s first soundtrack was composed for the 20th Century Fox Film “Welcome Home Soldier Boys” and earned her a spot in “Who’s Who in America.”</p> <p>In 1972, the folk-rock album “Ronee Blakley” debuted on Elektra Records.

An L.A. resident via Seattle and NY. He's been playing and touring with Shooter Jennings since 2003. Ted also always been making records on his own, too. He started PoMo records in 1995 to put out his first album. many years and albums later, Ted has a new CD called Divisadero. The street date is Jan. 30 2007!! and it has been getting a lot of radio play on independent and satellite radio stations and is getting distributed in stores. here's a little more history… By 2001, Ted was in L.A. starting to develop his own brand of American music while making a living playing with a million bands including Candye Kane, Kevin Banford, Eugene Edwards, Preston Smith, The Better Days, and Robin Wiley. As Ted honed in on his musical interests – the combination of country and soul relying on the roots of American music, Ted formed his own band, Union Pacific, that played around L.A. and San Diego and, at the same time, became a highly sought after bassist doing session, national TV shoes, and many international tours. In 2003 Ted met and began playing bass with Shooter Jennings. The first Shooter Jennings album came out in March of 2005 on Universal South almost to the day when NorthSouth was released on Ted's own label PoMo Records. Ted spent most of 2005 touring the U.S. with Shooter as the band's 'Put the O Back In Country' sold 225,000 records. In fact, Ted wrote the song ""Steady at the Wheel"" on the Shooter record, which became the record's 2nd single and was ..1 on the Texas charts for over a month. The band opened for Toby Keith and Lee Ann Womack through the summer, and played clubs, theaters, and festivals all year, as well as opening for Robert Earl Keen, Willie Nelson, and others. 2006 was also a great year. Shooter and the 357's released their second record in April, while Ted released 2 new records, comprised of many new songs written and recorded on the road with Shooter and the band as well as with his old friends from the L.A. scene. The band's year of touring included the David Letterman Show, The Craig Ferguson Show, Bonnaroo, the Wakarusa Festival, and the Willie Nelson 4th of July Picnic, a Summer tour opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd and 3 Doors Down, as well as headlining many venues – over 150 shows in 2006. And the new Shooter single ""Gone To Carolina"" broke the Top 20 Charts on CMT. Trying to juggle a 'solo' career and be a support player for Shooter is difficult, but being a part of the Waylon Jennings – Jessi Colter – Shooter Jennings tradition is an indescribable honor. With the release of Nashville Fineline and Divisadero, Ted hopes to do continue making his own music as well as doing the Jennings family legacy justice","<p>Please visit my website: <a href=""http://www.tedrussellkamp.com/"">Ted Russell Kamp</a> I also have a personal MySpace site: <a href=""http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=15235141"">More about Ted</a> </p><p>Ted is a singer/songwriter/bass player/producer.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/rod-melancon","Rod Melancon","Louisiana","","Roots country singer/songwriter Rod Melancon was born August 16, 1988 in South Louisiana. At the age of 18 he packed and headed out west to California. In December 2007, he received his first guitar as a Christmas Present. That same year he bought his grandfather a cd with a collection of Hank Williams Sr. songs. His grandfather went into a corner of the house, put on the album, and listened for what seemed to be hours. Amazed at the impact the collection of songs had on his grandfather, Rod soon started teaching himself to play by listening to that same collection of songs. Before too long, he started writing his own songs. His first song, “My Brother” which he wrote in late 2008 received a lot of great feedback which motivated him to put more and more effort into it. Around the same time he met Brad Nickel, a fellow musician and kindred spirit from New York who supported and encouraged Rod’s musical explorations. After a series of late night jam sessions, Brad offered to produce Rod’s first album gratis. In early, 2009 over two whirlwind weeks, Rod recorded what would become his self titled debut album of 11 songs at Brad’s parents home in Idaho. Nine of the songs were written by Rod, while “On The Road” and “Sweet Simplicity” were written in collaboration with Brad. Rod’s debut album was released on CD Baby, www.cdbaby.com, in July 2009 and soon after was picked up by iTunes, Rhapsody, and Amazon. He charted almost immediately on the alternative country charts and has been reviewed positively in a number of international markets, Belgium, UK, and the Netherlands just to name few. He’s been likened to a young Johnny Cash and Steve Earle.","<p>Roots country singer/songwriter Rod Melancon was born August 16, 1988 in South Louisiana.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/jesse-and-noah","Jesse and Noah","Darby, FL","","Jesse and Noah Bellamy are a brother duo, and just as other classic brother groups (The Louvin Brothers, The Everlys, The Kinks, et al.) who have forged their own unique sound and identities, Jesse and Noah are also pushing musical boundaries to create their own path. With their third record, Driven Back, the duo delivers an eclectic mix of roots-rock, power-pop, country and Americana. Coming from a family of musicians they are the fourth generation to play music. Their father and uncle are the well-known Bellamy Brothers and their grandfather, Homer, played professionally at local dances, while his father before him was a fiddler. Raised by their grandparents while their parents toured, the duo was first influenced by their grandparents’ love of traditional country music and the popular music of the WWII era. “When we started playing guitar”, said Jesse, “we fell in love with blues, jazz and sixties rock. Hanging out at Dad’s recording sessions, led us to develop an appreciation of the recording process as an art form.” After years of writing and recording with different record labels and becoming disillusioned with Music Row of Nashville, Jesse and Noah have thrown away the rulebook to forge their own sound. Driven Back is self-produced and independently released. Recorded at their project studio in Franklin, TN (just outside of Nashville), they were very conscience of keeping the project authentic and not over-produced. Both brothers wrote the songs on the record (the exception being “You Could Have Had It All” which was written by Jesse Bellamy with Steve Clark)—with most of the songs being written as they recorded them, unlike previous projects. Accomplished multi-instrumentalists, they’re responsible for the majority of the tracks on Driven Back, with vocals led by Jesse, with Noah harmonizing. As Jesse told the music website Riveting Riffs, “We just really wanted to make a good record…these songs don’t have to work outside the context of this record. That is the cool thing about a lot of them. It was just about feels and putting words up against them and seeing what stuck.” The 10 tracks on the album start with “Weather Man”, an up-tempo folk rock tune (featuring the violin of Elin Palmer). “True Love Doesn’t Beg” features a Latin-infused ‘exotica’ styled murder ballad that features guitar in the style of Link Wray. “Lilly Vereen” is a Southern Gothic themed waltz set in New Orleans. Once again Elin Palmer is featured on nyckelharpa, a traditional Swedish keyed violin, with Noah on auto-harp adding to the chamber-folk aesthetic. (Side note: the lyrical imagery was inspired by photographer E.J. Bellocq’s famous “Storyville” portraits from around 1912.) The title song, “Driven Back” is a garage blues tune that features over-driven feedback laden guitars, while “You Could Have Had It All” jumps to a retro country-pop ballad with an interesting dual vocal harmony. “Traveler’s Prayer” uses ukulele to bring us a roots reggae inspired song while “Bend in the Road” is tribute to the 70’s country-pop of Glen Campbell and Jimmy Webb. Trying to re-create what their grandfather’s band may have sounded like, the brothers came up with “The Homer Bellamy Centennial Blue Yodel”. Influenced by early country artists like Jimmie Rodgers, Frank Hutchison, and Cliff Carlisle, the instrumentation was inspired by the pre-bluegrass 1930’s ‘hillbilly’ music. “Florida Water” is homage to their much-maligned home state, combining southern musical traditions with the Latin-Caribbean cultural influences of the Peninsula. “Guilty of Myself” ends the record with a stripped down semi-acoustic ballad. Fans are of great importance to the brothers and their past records have built a huge following in Texas, with their debut project Nowhere Revisited being based out of Fort Worth and with the Smith Music Group. Their first single, “Daddy’s got a Shot Gun” made the Texas Music Chart’s top 50 songs of 2006. Their second release, Landfall generated fans from Texas to Tennessee and in between and even charted on the HotDisc Top 40 in Europe. Traditionally, brother duos have been some of the most creative and innovative in the history of Rock and Country Music—Jesse and Noah are willing and able to live up to that tradition. With Driven Back, the brothers are proving that they are self-sufficient artists who can cross genres and gain fans simply through hard work, good music and great songs.","<p>Jesse and Noah Bellamy are a brother duo, and just as other classic brother groups (The Louvin Brothers, The Everlys, The Kinks, et al.) who have forged their own unique sound and identities, Jesse and Noah are also pushing musical boundaries to create their own path.</p> <p>With their third record, Driven Back, the duo delivers an eclectic mix of roots-rock, power-pop, country and Americana.

Influenced by early country artists like Jimmie Rodgers, Frank Hutchison, and Cliff Carlisle, the instrumentation was inspired by the pre-bluegrass 1930’s ‘hillbilly’ music.</p> <p>“Florida Water” is homage to their much-maligned home state, combining southern musical traditions with the Latin-Caribbean cultural influences of the Peninsula. “Guilty of Myself” ends the record with a stripped down semi-acoustic ballad.</p> <p>Fans are of great importance to the brothers and their past records have built a huge following in Texas, with their debut project Nowhere Revisited being based out of Fort Worth and with the Smith Music Group. Their first single, “Daddy’s got a Shot Gun” made the Texas Music Chart’s top 50 songs of 2006. Their second release, Landfall generated fans from Texas to Tennessee and in between and even charted on the HotDisc Top 40 in Europe.</p> <p>Traditionally, brother duos have been some of the most creative and innovative in the history of Rock and Country Music—Jesse and Noah are willing and able to live up to that tradition. With Driven Back, the brothers are proving that they are self-sufficient artists who can cross genres and gain fans simply through hard work, good music and great songs.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7178300/d60a41ce12af133bb909d0e83c7a9e5b_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/7UBzSTnKmY8?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

For those not yet familiar with the award-winning trio, prepare to experience one of the best Wisconsin has to offer. A raw blend of massive hooks, three-part harmonies and visceral energy, Sunspot’s music is designed to make you think, feel, and believe in the power of rock n’ roll. ""A talented band with a very unique twist on their music."" Torch Kerrang, Solid Rock Q98 Cynical, their current release, is easily their most focused and best-sounding record. ""This recording captures the intensity and energy of a Sunspot show,"" offers frontman Mike Huberty. ""We have carefully designed this record for maximum rockage."" Sunspot shows are popular because they appeal to both the visceral and intellectual side of the audience. They’re not afraid to engage the audience through obscure pop references (crowd favorite “Scott Bakula” is a testament to that, even being used by Scott himself, as the theme for his 50th birthday party) or through aggressive and energetic hard rock with big guitar solos and even bigger choruses. The Platteville Exponent called them “hair-punk” and it’s an appropriate moniker. It’s all the fun of flashy rock but with all the satisfaction of substance over style, Cincinnati’s I See Sound calls their new record, Cynical, “…happy sounding rockers with an intellectual core.” It’s arena rock for geeks. Sunspot’s work on their previous album, Loser of the Year (2003), earned the band numerous accolades and critical acclaim. In 2004, the CD was named Album of the Year by the Madison Area Music Industry. In April of the following year, members of the Wisconsin Area Music Industry awarded Sunspot its highly coveted Group of the Year designation. ""…their tasty blend of rock and pop screams for radio attention and national exposure… ready for mass consumption,"" MikeSOS, Geoff Wilbur’s Renegade Newsletter Music directors across the Midwest have already embraced Sunspot. To date, the band has performed showcases on Madison’s WYOU-TV, Milwaukee’s WLUM, as well as air time on WLZR, WMSE, WAPL, WFBZ, WIBA, WJJO, WMAD, WMUR, WORT, WSUM, WXSS, WISM, and WRQT. Their tune ""Meat Market,"" was awarded ""Track of the Day"" on GarageBand.com and they have been featured in indie radio magazine, College 500 (April 2002). Sunspot has found critical success as well. Vitaminic calls them ""pure rock and roll adrenaline."" SOSMusic NYC says Sunspot knows ""how to write a memorable hook"" and adds, ""they’re ready for mass consumption."" Cincinnati’s CityBeat says their music is ""endearingly honest PopRock free of gimmickry."" South of Mainstream says that ""they’ll certainly have their day in the sun."" GodsofMusic.com says Sunspot is a band with ""edge"" that ""rocks the joint."" Fast on the heels of their regional achievements, Sunspot is passionate about bringing their anthem-like music to a much wider audience. Besides their relentless tour schedule throughout the Midwest, with regular dates in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, and Indiana, the band has already branched out with multiple national tours performing concerts in major North American cities such as New York, Boston, Nashville, Houston, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Washington D.C., Detroit, Toronto, Austin, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, and Tulsa. Touring has paid off, too. Sunspot has already opened for Death Cab for Cutie, Hot Hot Heat, Sponge, SevenMaryThree, Pilot to Gunner, and House of Large Sizes. Punk legend Milo Aukerman recently joined Sunspot on stage for a crowd-roaring rendition of the Descendents’ classic, ""Hope.""

They’re not afraid to engage the audience through obscure pop references (crowd favorite “Scott Bakula” is a testament to that, even being used by Scott himself, as the theme for his 50th birthday party) or through aggressive and energetic hard rock with big guitar solos and even bigger choruses. The Platteville Exponent called them “hair-punk” and it’s an appropriate moniker. It’s all the fun of flashy rock but with all the satisfaction of substance over style, Cincinnati’s I See Sound calls their new record, Cynical, “…happy sounding rockers with an intellectual core.” It’s arena rock for geeks. Sunspot’s work on their previous album, Loser of the Year (2003), earned the band numerous accolades and critical acclaim. In 2004, the CD was named Album of the Year by the Madison Area Music Industry. In April of the following year, members of the Wisconsin Area Music Industry awarded Sunspot its highly coveted Group of the Year designation. ""…their tasty blend of rock and pop screams for radio attention and national exposure… ready for mass consumption,"" MikeSOS, Geoff Wilbur’s Renegade Newsletter Music directors across the Midwest have already embraced Sunspot. To date, the band has performed showcases on Madison’s <span class=""caps"">WYOU</span>-TV, Milwaukee’s <span class=""caps"">WLUM</span>, as well as air time on <span class=""caps"">WLZR</span>, <span class=""caps"">WMSE</span>, <span class=""caps"">WAPL</span>, <span class=""caps"">WFBZ</span>, <span class=""caps"">WIBA</span>, <span class=""caps"">WJJO</span>, <span class=""caps"">WMAD</span>, <span class=""caps"">WMUR</span>, <span class=""caps"">WORT</span>, <span class=""caps"">WSUM</span>, <span class=""caps"">WXSS</span>, <span class=""caps"">WISM</span>, and <span class=""caps"">WRQT</span>. Their tune ""Meat Market,"" was awarded ""Track of the Day"" on GarageBand.com and they have been featured in indie radio magazine, College 500 (April 2002). Sunspot has found critical success as well. Vitaminic calls them ""pure rock and roll adrenaline."" SOSMusic <span class=""caps"">NYC</span> says Sunspot knows ""how to write a memorable hook"" and adds, ""they’re ready for mass consumption."" Cincinnati’s CityBeat says their music is ""endearingly honest PopRock free of gimmickry."" South of Mainstream says that ""they’ll certainly have their day in the sun."" GodsofMusic.com says Sunspot is a band with ""edge"" that ""rocks the joint."" Fast on the heels of their regional achievements, Sunspot is passionate about bringing their anthem-like music to a much wider audience. Besides their relentless tour schedule throughout the Midwest, with regular dates in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, and Indiana, the band has already branched out with multiple national tours performing concerts in major North American cities such as New York, Boston, Nashville, Houston, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Washington D.C., Detroit, Toronto, Austin, Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, and Tulsa. Touring has paid off, too. Sunspot has already opened for Death Cab for Cutie, Hot Hot Heat, Sponge, SevenMaryThree, Pilot to Gunner, and House of Large Sizes. Punk legend Milo Aukerman recently joined Sunspot on stage for a crowd-roaring rendition of the Descendents’ classic, ""Hope."" Vocalist/bassist Mike Huberty, lead guitarist Ben Jaeger, and drummer Wendy Lynn Staats share a musical vision to blend the best and most passionate ingredients of punk, alternative, and metal to create an intense rock and roll cocktail.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/dog-bite","Dog Bite","Atlanta, GA","experimental, new wave, sample based","Like the album’s cloudy cover, Dog Bite’s Carpark debut, Velvet Changes, captivates with its prettiness and welcomes return visits thanks to its alluring mysteriousness. The project of Atlanta’s Phil Jones, Dog Bite’s dreamy jangle and confidently composed melodies were initially worked out with an acoustic guitar on the road, while Jones was touring with Washed Out as a keyboardist. First making music at the end of his high school days, the 23-year-old began Dog Bite after dropping out of the Savannah College of Art and Design. Influenced by the work of J Dilla, Portishead, Caribou, and The Roots, Jones found more inspiration for Velvet Changes in the New Zealand psych-pop of Connan Mockasin and the chilling 1975 film Picnic at Hanging Rock. Using the first half of the movie as a jumping-off point, Jones imagines his own storylines to explain the film’s key dilemma: a group of schoolgirls and their teacher set out for a picnic, only for a part of the group to disappear without an explanation. Velvet Changes may not come to any clear conclusions, but Dog Bite’s wondering will have you curious as well. In addition to his time with Washed Out, Jones has appeared on a matthewdavid release and produced for Mood Rings and Bosco. As one half of Acid Flashback, he’s crafted tunes for the voice of Karen Jacobs (of Toronto’s Free Kisses). Dog Bite performs live as a four-piece, featuring Jones’ friend Woody Shortridge of fellow Atlanta band Balkans who also helped write the basslines on Velvet Changes. Preceded by self-released tracks and a 7-inch and CD on Young Turks, Velvet Changes favors a fuller sound without the aid of samples. A lyric from the album’s “Native America” seems to summarize the record’s contemporary take on C86-style pop: “I’m running with the clouds and taking everything.”","<p>Like the album’s cloudy cover, Dog Bite’s Carpark debut, Velvet Changes, captivates with its prettiness and welcomes return visits thanks to its alluring mysteriousness.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/mike-burns","Mike Burns","Los Angeles, CA","","Mike Burns has such an inescapable passion and talent for music. He has perfected his craft of songwriting so that he pulls in all who stumble upon his music. He shows them his story: a story of struggle, of endurance, of dedication, of a constant rollercoaster of changes for better or worse…but most of all, a story of love. With a voice that could quiet the rowdiest of crowds and lyrics that will stay with you long after the final chord has been played, Mike Burns enables a broad interpretation that will leave you hanging on every beautifully crafted word. In the spring of 2010 Mike played an industry showcase in Malibu, CA for various music supervisors at Rami Jaffee’s (of the Foo Fighters) house. Showcasing material from his upcoming coming record “Courage & Longing” due to release late summer of 2010… it’s safe to say he made an impression on some of the top industry people in L.A. Mike was born in Lakeland, FL, but his parents’ involvement in the military caused him to be raised in 9 different states. It’s no wonder why his music is now so easily relatable to all who venture to listen. It wasn’t until he graduated High School in 2002 that Mike really found his way with music, and in 2004 he moved to L.A. where he was an active singer/songwriter in the music scene there. Constantly learning from such a hustle and bustle world, he relentlessly endured the process that every musician is bound to encounter while following their dreams. Mike’s first full band, full length record, “Where the Heart Is” (Produced by JP Hesser at Castaway 7 Studios in Ventura, CA), was released in 2006, but it didn’t take him long to realize that being the front man of a rock band was not the avenue he wanted to take to pursue his intense passion for music. Instead, he took “Where the Heart Is” on a 16 city acoustic tour across the country. In December of 2007, Mike met Joel Lamb at a show where they had both performed. Joel joined the band in early 2008, and by April they had already made “The Dreamworld EP” including 5 songs with a softer sound than those from “Where the Heart Is”. Even with only 5 songs, “The Dreamworld EP” contains everything from the soft catchy hums of “Postcard” to the harmonica infused, laid-back folksy sound of “Am I On?”. After the release, the band (Also featuring: Matt Thrift, JP Hesser and Jimbo Russell) went out on a small tour through the Midwest. However, when they returned home, the band decided to split up because of conflicting schedules and interests. Even without a full band, Mike and Joel never gave up writing and experimenting to find inspiration for a new record. Joel Lamb shares Mike’s intense passion for music, and has the same drive to keep that passion alive. He was born in Seattle, WA, but was raised in a rural town just north of the city. His parents had always sung at church, so he grew up around music. They encouraged Joel to learn the guitar and piano at an early age, and by the time he was 13, he was already writing his own songs. All throughout High School Joel sang and played with different bands. He constantly dropped out of college to promote his various musical projects. In 2001, when he was only 21 years old, Joel packed all of his possessions into his teeny car and made the drive to California. For the next 6 years, Joel played with a dozen different jazz, punk, and indie bands until he met Mike in late 2007. Almost instantly, they knew the creative potential and influence they could bring to the world if they were to join together. So, in early 2008, Joel dropped his other musical projects and joined Mike full time. In addition to guitar and piano, Joel also plays the accordion, hammond organ, harmonica, and does digital programming for recordings. Mike and Joel are currently living in Austin, TX—a change of pace, and a new place to share their artistic gifts. Whatever the city, a cloud of support and love from their friends, families, and fans follow Mike and Joel everywhere they go. In early 2010 Jason Kraft joined Mike and Joel on upright bass. Providing a more classical jazz application to the band. On Oct 26, 2010 they released another full length record “Courage & Longing” and immediately recorded a 3 song EP to release early 2011. They are a rare breed of man who knows exactly what they want and will stop at nothing to get it. They refuse to let anyone bring them down. They stick with their beliefs and passions and goals even if the world doesn’t quite seem to be ready for them. Wherever they go, Mike Burns and Joel Lamb have a way of winning over the crowd… What you see is what you get, and what you see is a force to be reckoned with—a plethora of beautifully placed chords and an unforgettable, unwavering voice.","<p>Mike Burns has such an inescapable passion and talent for music.

The recent show at L.A.‘s infamous Whisky a Go Go, marks Sami’s first return to her California roots.This past year, the band opened for Chely Wright at Chicago Pride’s Backlot Bash and for Brother Trouble, winners of Kenny Chesney’s Next Big Star. They were recently featured in several segments on CBS Chicago leading up to the Chicago Music Awards. Sami’s new album, ATLANTIS, a collaboration with Shannon Nicole and Jaclyn Rada, received 6 entries in the first round of Grammy pre-nominations. Co-produced by Grammy Award winner, Ricciano Lumpkins, ATLANTIS features Grammy Award winning blues artist, Sugar Blue, on the country-infused, Two of Hearts, and hip-hop sensation, Viper (of Follow Your Instinct), on the “upbeat-you-must-shake-your-rump-and-clap-your-hands” Hooky (in Chicago). Sami Grisafe’s artistry has been crafted over the years through music, acting and sports. She chartered new territory as a female athlete in California and the U.S. by playing boy’s baseball for nine years. (Sami was the first girl in Redlands to make a boy’s baseball all-star team). She played football for six years, becoming the first woman in California to play quarter back in a varsity, Division I football game; and played professional football with the Chicago Force. She led the Team USA to the world female football championship and became the number one female quarterback on the planet. After falling in love with theatre during high school, she received a scholarship to the Chicago College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University where she earned her BFA in Acting. That experience paid off big time and becomes evident the moment Sami takes the stage and her dynamic personality commands your attention. Sami grew up listening and watching her parents, Greg and Kim, and her Aunt Angie, perform all over southern California. Those childhood experiences inspired her song, Two of Hearts, dedicated to her parents and named after their country & western band. With a unique combination of songwriting and musical talent (a birth right from her parents), a theater performance degree and the drive and dedication of a professional athlete, Sami has shaped her cutting edge, trailblazing approach to music.","<p><b><i>“a vocal powerhouse that will rock your face off” </i></b><br><br>The <span class=""caps"">SAMI</span> <span class=""caps"">GRISAFE</span> <span class=""caps"">BAND</span> featuring the talented Chris Buehrle, Jaclyn Rada, Andy Neel, Janet Cramer is packing venues and rocking legendary stages – Chicago’s Metro, Double Door and Cubby Bear – and performing across the U.S. including shows at a showcase during <span class=""caps"">SXSW</span> in Austin, Nashville and New York.

Wenige Jahre später entwickelte sich während der Grundschulzeit auf der Waldorfschule Sookees Sprachaffinität und ihre Begeisterung für kreative Prozesse wie eigeninitiatives D.I.Y.. Die wilden Jugendjahre verlebte Sookee zuweilen etwas vernebelt zwischen – in ihrem Fall – zeitverschwenderischem Street-Gedöns und der ambitionierten Suche nach Identität und Inhalt. HipHop hatte sich derweil auch schon in ihre Lebenszusammenhänge geschlichen und so begegnete Sookee 2003 ihrem ersten Text auf einem Beat. Kurz darauf bot ihr das Berliner Label Springstoff eine professionelle Obhut. Etwa zeitgleich nahm sie ihr Studium der Germanistischen Linguistik und Gender Studies auf und der Brückenbau zwischen zwei Paralleluniversen hatte begonnen und hält auch nach der Beendigung des Studiums an. Seit 2006 entfernten sich ihre Worte zuweilen von musikalischen Untermalungen und Sookee erprobte sich mit Spoken Words und anderen lyrischen Experimenten unter anderem auf Poetry Slams. Derweil promoviert sie zu einem Schnittmengenthema aus DDR-Geschichte, Geschlechterkonzepten in der Pädagogik und sozial-räumlicher Unfreiheit und schaut im Zwischenstand darauf zurück, wer sie bis hierhin geworden ist. Was sie tut… Zunächst mal versteht sich Sookee als Rapperin. Sie fühlt sich heimisch am Textblatt, auf Beats, im Studio und auf der Bühne. HipHop ist ihre erste kulturelle Liebe und Rap nach wie vor ihr favorisiertes Medium. Sie hat in den letzten Jahren dutzende Tracks, Features und Samplerbeiträge zustande gebracht und 2005 ihr Solo-Debüt “Kopf Herz Arsch” dem öffentlichen Ohr zugängig gemacht. Darüber hinaus entdeckt sie zunehmend die Freiheiten, die ihr andere lyrische und literarische Formen beispielsweise in der Slam Poetry bieten. Texte ohne Reime und eine treibende Snare im Rücken zu verfassen hat durchaus einen Reiz. Neue Rhythmen, ein anderes thematisches und stilistisches Spektrum beferein sie, was sich wiederum positiv auf ihre beatbasierten Texte auswirkt. Anderen Menschen scheint dies auch zuzusagen, sodass sie auf diverse große und kleine Slams zum Vortrag geladen wird. Im dritten Schritt führt sie ihre Kenntnisse zusammen und reicht sie in Workshops an ‘die Jugend von heute’ weiter, spricht auf öffentlichen Podiumsdiskussionen u.ä. über die politischen Dimensionen von Sprache, HipHop und Medien und steht immer wieder als Interviewpartnerin für wissenschaftliche Arbeiten und Medienberichte zur Verfügung. Was sie will… Mit- und weiterdenken, kritisch nachfragen und Dialoge führen sind die drei Achsen, entlang derer sich Sookee in ihrem kulturellen und politischen Werden und Wirken bewegt. Insbesondere die Auseinandersetzung mit Jugendlichen liegt ihr am Herzen: Da wo HipHop als Jugendkultur versäumt politisches Potenzial zu nutzen und wo Akademiker_innentum und Feuilleton von oben über Jugend und Jugendkulturen alles mögliche zu wissen meinen, sucht sie das Gespräch nicht mit der Zukunft, sondern mit der Gegenwart der Gesellschaft. Die Anregungen und Erkenntnisse dieser Denk- und Dialogbewegungen schlagen sich in Sookees Texten nieder. Wie Machtstrukturen und Identitäten in verschiedenen Lebenszusammenhängen verfasst und wie diese geäußert und aufgenommen werden, sind Fragen, die sie umtreiben. HipHops Makel hinsichtlich Sexismus, Homophobie sowie Gewalt- und Kapitalismusidealisierung versucht sie mit ihrem Entwurf von ‘Quing’ zu überwinden, um sich voll und ganz auf die ihr wichtigen Themen und den Spaß an der Freude konzentrieren zu können.","<p>Impressum:<br /> <span class=""caps"">SPRINGSTOFF</span><br /> Groß & Scheerer GbR<br /> Triftstr. 5<br /> 13437 Berlin</p> <p>Lebenswelt:<br /> Wer sie ist…</p> <p>Bevor Sookees Familie aus politischen Gründen die <span class=""caps"">DDR</span> hinter sich ließ und nach West-Berlin ging, schrieb sich der realexistierende Sozialismus nachhaltig in ihre junge Biographie ein.

Neue Rhythmen, ein anderes thematisches und stilistisches Spektrum beferein sie, was sich wiederum positiv auf ihre beatbasierten Texte auswirkt. Anderen Menschen scheint dies auch zuzusagen, sodass sie auf diverse große und kleine Slams zum Vortrag geladen wird.<br /> Im dritten Schritt führt sie ihre Kenntnisse zusammen und reicht sie in Workshops an ‘die Jugend von heute’ weiter, spricht auf öffentlichen Podiumsdiskussionen u.ä. über die politischen Dimensionen von Sprache, HipHop und Medien und steht immer wieder als Interviewpartnerin für wissenschaftliche Arbeiten und Medienberichte zur Verfügung.</p> <p>Was sie will…</p> <p>Mit- und weiterdenken, kritisch nachfragen und Dialoge führen sind die drei Achsen, entlang derer sich Sookee in ihrem kulturellen und politischen Werden und Wirken bewegt. Insbesondere die Auseinandersetzung mit Jugendlichen liegt ihr am Herzen: Da wo HipHop als Jugendkultur versäumt politisches Potenzial zu nutzen und wo Akademiker_innentum und Feuilleton von oben über Jugend und Jugendkulturen alles mögliche zu wissen meinen, sucht sie das Gespräch nicht mit der Zukunft, sondern mit der Gegenwart der Gesellschaft. Die Anregungen und Erkenntnisse dieser Denk- und Dialogbewegungen schlagen sich in Sookees Texten nieder. Wie Machtstrukturen und Identitäten in verschiedenen Lebenszusammenhängen verfasst und wie diese geäußert und aufgenommen werden, sind Fragen, die sie umtreiben.<br /> HipHops Makel hinsichtlich Sexismus, Homophobie sowie Gewalt- und Kapitalismusidealisierung versucht sie mit ihrem Entwurf von ‘Quing’ zu überwinden, um sich voll und ganz auf die ihr wichtigen Themen und den Spaß an der Freude konzentrieren zu können.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7398149/92b8773574eef35277ff0884ac65be36_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/uGjPLKmJ5zY?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/ume","Ume","Austin, TX","rock, female vocalists, indie rock","Ume (pronounced ooo-may) is an Austin trio who has built a reputation as one of indie rock’s heaviest live bands. On their new EP, the power of Ume’s live show has been captured and surpassed. With this sophomore release, Lauren Larson’s ferocious guitar riffs and fiery vocals have combined with a melodic beauty that completely transcends their previous efforts. With a rock-solid rhythmic foundation provided by Eric Larson on bass and Jeff Barrera on drums, Ume has delivered a unique combination of catchy pop sweetness, delay-drenched noise, and jaw-dropping intensity Behind Ume’s explosive music is an unassuming and quite shy trio. Guitarist/vocalist Lauren says (in her southern drawl) that show after show she meets people who don’t think she could possibly have played in punk rock bands for over a decade. She has even had audience members ask if the guitar parts were pre-recorded, because “nobody could play guitar like that, wail, and flail around so much on stage.” Sorry folks, this pint-sized shredder is the real deal. One of her first fans was bassist Eric Larson, who asked the then 15 year-old guitarist to go out after seeing her grind-core band perform on a skatepark vert ramp. While attending Houston-area DIY punk shows, the high-school couple met drummer Jeff Barrera. They ran into him a few years later at an Unwound concert and formed Ume in 2002. Shortly thereafter, Lauren moved with Eric to Pennsylvania to pursue a graduate degree in philosophy. Though only able to practice a few times a year, the band stayed together across 1,600 miles. After seeing Ume live in Brooklyn, the NYC label Pretty Activity released their debut “Urgent Sea” in 2005. The album was called “about as good as it gets” by the Philadelphia Weekly. The band rejoined in Austin in 2007 and recorded their latest Sunshower EP with Frenchie Smith (Trail of Dead, Dandy Warhols) at The Bubble in 2008. As evidenced on standout tracks “The Conductor” and “Pendulum,” this EP combines moments of melodic tenderness with epic hooks and some of the heaviest riffs you’ll hear this year. The intensity takes an entirely different shape on the elegant piano-tinged “Sunshower,” as the song’s lush vocals and hypnotic rhythms highlight Ume’s dynamic progression. These three tracks offer an exciting glimpse of what to expect from the band’s upcoming full length, which they will begin recording this summer. Building on the momentum of their busy 2007/08 schedule, which saw stops at both CMJ, SXSW, and Fun Fun Fun Fest, along with a leak of Sunshower landing on Gang of Four bassist Dave Allen’s top ten list for 2008 (pampelmoose.com), and tracks from the EP getting spins on Seattle’s KEXP, Portland’s KNRK, and Austin’s 101X, Ume is set to be one of the breakout acts of 2009. Ume has shared the stage with such diverse bands as Arcade Fire, Marnie Stern, The Fall, Times New Viking, A Place to Bury Strangers, Oneida, Magnolia Electric Co., and Dead Confederate, and will be appearing at this year’s SXSW. www.myspace.com/umemusic www.umemusic.com/sunshower/ Listen at Last.fmWatch videos of Ume playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!","<p>Ume (pronounced ooo-may) is an Austin trio who has built a reputation as one of indie rock’s heaviest live bands.

After attending and promptly dropping out of Wesleyan University, Connecticut (whose alumni include Santigold and MGMT), Darwin moved to and found himself at home in New York City. In the East Village, he became a fixture of Monday nights at the Sidewalk Café, a ‘legendary stomping ground for NYC’s Anti-folk scene’ responsible for launching artists such as Regina Spektor, Adam Green and Kimya Dawson. Here, Deez felt like he had finally found his niche. “It was the real hub of the action for me. I became inspired to write better lyrics by studying the other songwriter-performers there”. As Darwin came into his own as a performer, his live shows became extravaganzas of unbridled energy and unfettered joy. He’s been known to break into spontaneous bouts of synchronised dancing which can erupt anytime, almost out of nowhere. Describing his strain of pop as “a little bit Thriller, a little bit Dismemberment Plan” and with a fondness for D.I.Y aesthetics and twisted wordplay, his sound calls to mind everyone from The Strokes and Beck to Arthur Russell and The Flaming Lips. His recently released self titled debut album has been met with universal praise from international radio and press, including the likes of Nylon, Stereogum, BBC Radio 1 and ,especially, the NME who named him the 10th coolest musician on the planet and placed him on their cover. Singularly a brilliant, hilarious, complex, entertaining individual, Darwin Deez writes songs that will make you want to bust out your dancing shoes while also cutting to that raw, emotional nerve.","<p>Born in North Carolina to Maher Baba disciples, Darwin grew up on a diet of Weezer, Nirvana and Nada Surf, and started his first band with friends at age 12.

Hot on the follow up to eponymous first E.P this new release is yet further proof of this experimental bands ability to fuse audio technology with good old, fashioned heart felt songs. Melodies melt into glitchy beats and bass heavy riffs buoy up guitar solos, seamlessly soaring into crescendos of dance friendly rhythms all pulled together by singer Tim Digby-Bells emotion ridden vocals. In between retreating to the wilds of South England to write and produce the band have found time to self curate a number of sell out show’s with the likes of Matthew Dear, Darkstar, Breton and Worship as well as joining Metronomy for his Shepherds Bush Empire show earlier this year. In addition the band remixed a counterpart E.P to their debut release and collaborated with up and coming director and VJ, Lewis Kyle White ( 2 Many DJ’s, Radio Soulwax, Crystal Fighters) to produce four remix videos currently being hosted online at duologuemusic.co.uk. “I guess we would consider ourselves musicians and producers in the way we approach a track, we write the song, break it apart and build it up layer by layer, using as many new sounds and beats as possible and pushing it as far as it can go.” Deceptively named, Duologue’s first incarnation was born from the meeting of musicobsessive’s techno DJ and beats programmer Toby Leeming and guitarist vocalist Tim Digby-Bell whilst studying in Edinburgh. Through a shared love of obscure electronica, subversive Detroit techno as well as the more usual suspects like Aphex Twin and Radiohead the pair went from bedroom experimentalists to recruiting fellow childhood and university pals Seb Dilleyston (violins) Ross Stone (bass) and Toby Lee (lead guitar) to form a fully fledged band. ‘A-B’ is Duologue’s second EP and arrives on the tail of a limited edition 10”, eponymous E.P and it’s self-remixed counterpart E.P that spawned collaboration with graphic designer and VJ Lewis Kyle White resulting in the remix videos that are currently hosted online at duologuemusic.co.uk. The bands ambitious writing; Leeming’s hypnotising heavy beats and poet Digby-Bell’s fractured lyrics, which often tell of their frustration with the monotony of the everyday. Their escapism is the excess of noise and they clash together opposites by challenging genres, as in the haunting electro ballad of ‘Endless Imitation’, and the rock dance track of ‘Push It’. ‘A-B’ is a taster of this unique, band’s ability to throw you in the audio tumble dryer and leave you euphoric, elated and always thinking.","<p>Written, performed, produced and mixed by Duologue, so goes the credit on A-B the impressive futuristic electro rock infused second E.P from London based five-piece Duologue.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/kitten","Kitten","Los Angeles, CA","","For Chloe Chaidez, frontwoman of the electrifying rock group Kitten, the trajectory from rock fan to rock star began in carpool. “Growing up my dad had to drive an hour and half every day five days a week to take me to gymnastics,” she recalls. Chloe’s father, a drummer from LA’s early punk scene, used this time to communicate the important things in life to his young daughter: Mott the Hoople, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. “We listened to lots of classic rock,” Chloe recalls. “But we also played the new CMJ mixes. This is pre-internet and that’s how you learned about new bands, from little CDs that came with cool magazines. Bands like Sigur Ross, Band of Horses…” By ten Chloe had begun playing bass and had formed her own band. By 12 she was opening for indie artists such as Midlake and Conor Oberst with her blend of hip covers and precocious originals. “I probably watched School of Rock 100 times,” Chloe says, laughing. “That was all I wanted to do.” It’s not a surprise that Chloe was so naturally drawn to the rebel artists’ life. Both her mom and dad are creative and the singer’s older brother, the scholar in the family, also dabbles in music. “School is really his thing,” Chloe says. “ Mathematics. But he’s also a really natural musician.” School was not Chloe’s thing. “I got into a lot of trouble from a very early age,” she remembers. Music was all that ever held her attention but within that particular world she is as educated as they come. A consummate rock nerd, she can easefully narrate the creative through-line from My Bloody Valentine to Washed Out, discuss her appreciation of everyone from Cat Power to the Notorious B.I.G., then pivot to music business speak to dissect Grimes’ marketability in the mainstream. “People always say, oh she’s so young but the thing is, I have been doing this for a really long time already,” Chloe says. “I love it. As cliché as it sounds, it’s my life. It’s all I do.” While writing songs, recording, and performing live have been a major part of her daily life over the last few years, what’s been more of a challenge, she says, is learning how to focus her vision. “You can write a song on an acoustic guitar and it can sound any way you want. It can be anything you want it to be” she explains. “But over the last year or two, I’ve realized the particular music that I actually wanted to make, the sound I wanted and the point of view that I wanted it to come from.” The path to this realization wasn’t without it’s rough patches. Ironically after signing her record deal, at the peak of her first small wave of success, when she should have been the happiest, Chloe nearly lost herself in rock and roll cliché. “I would drink before and after shows… do drugs,” Chloe remembers. “The real problem was that I couldn’t stop myself. It wasn’t just about fun. I was frustrated, scared and confused and I wanted to kill those feelings, but I justified it by saying this is the rock and roll life style. It’s okay to do this ‘cause so did Iggy Pop, so did Lou Reed. Maybe I would write my own “Heroin” someday. But the thing is, drugs really do kill your creativity and they almost ruined my career before it even really started. That lifestyle, how I was living it, it lowers you. We almost had to shut the whole thing down. Part of the turnaround of this record is that I looked around and said, ‘Wait a minute. This isn’t a joke. This is my life. This is what I care about. What the hell am I doing?’” Back in LA, away from distractions, Chloe was finally clear-headed enough to truly explore what kind of music she wanted to make. Through songwriting collaborations with her manager and musical mentor, Chad Anderson, the singer started to hone in on her now signature sound. The ferocious power of late 70’s post punk blended with the textures and rhythms of 80’s British new wave and the shoegaze wall of sound, executed with an emotional delicacy all too rare for today. Soon after Chloe started messing around with computer rock at home with her brother, the stage was set for Kitten to rise. “I felt stuck with the band format’s mostly organic instruments so I started making beats with my brother in our bedrooms,” she remembers. “I found it really liberating.” Soon after I started falling in love with 80’s new wave, most of it British. Pet Shop Boys, OMD, Psychedelic Furs, New Order, The Eurythmics, American artists like The Motels and ‘till Tuesday, Prince… Liberating is a good descriptor for Kitten’s EP. A blend of the sophisticated elegance of dream pop with the jagged directness of rock and roll, it’s a declaration of intent and an auspicious announcement of the arrival of a new force in music. The title track “Cut It Out” has the sweetness of a delicate pop song underscored by a massive futuristic backbeat. “G#” is a reverb-drenched reinvention of classic shoegazer rock, slashed through with razor guitars and songs like “Sugar” showcase Chloe’s willingness to be intimate and vulnerable even from within these layers of raucous noise. From considered near-ballads, to epic walls of sound the EP showcases the dynamic range of Chloe’s young band. It’s almost as if Chloe Chaidez has been in training for close to a decade and is now ready for the major leagues. She’s always had the talent and the belief but now she has the sense of self and identity to back it up. “What’s going to make this band different is our live show,” says the singer, when asked what truly distinguishes Kitten. “I love being onstage more than anything. When you are up there you can do whatever you want. You can be whatever you want. If there’s one person in the back of the room not involved, then that’s my audience. I’ll do whatever I have to do to blow that person away. I want everybody in the audience to remember where they were when they saw Kitten for the first time.”","<p>For Chloe Chaidez, frontwoman of the electrifying rock group Kitten, the trajectory from rock fan to rock star began in carpool. “Growing up my dad had to drive an hour and half every day five days a week to take me to gymnastics,” she recalls.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-lonely-wild","The Lonely Wild","Los Angeles, CA","rock, indie, folk","With songs that blaze through the dusty American West, quickly-rising L.A. quintet The Lonely Wild stand poised to release their debut LP, “The Sun As It Comes.” The first single from the record, “Buried In the Murder,” is a fistfight of a tune, thrusting the growl of singer Andrew Carroll against the bombastic guitar freakouts of Andrew Schneider. The track seethes with boiling tension over a backdrop of stomps, claps and screams. Carroll’s voice swells from contemplation to utter outrage as he copes with the loss of innocence and being true to himself when all the odds are stacked against him. Drawing from personal experience, the songs that make up “The Sun As It Comes” are pulled from a collection built over the past three years. In the fall of 2009, Carroll witnessed the death of his grandmother who had lost her battle with drug addiction, watched his band of six years dissolve, and at last married his longtime love. To cope with these moments of pain and bliss, Carroll began writing songs on solo, acoustic guitar. He would wake with a melody in his head, and finish a song by the end of that day. “It was a very liberating way to write,” he says, “Coming from my prior band experience, where songs were totally dependent on the collaboration of all the members, it was nice to be able to write for myself. It allowed me to be more direct and honest.” But Carroll soon realized that his songs demanded a broader palate than one guitar and one voice. He wanted to create a sepia-toned world, a cracked landscape, a wind-torn desert. Enter multi-instrumentalist Ryan Ross, whose soaring trumpet and rumbling bass and organ bring drama and tension, guitarist Andrew Schneider, whose blistering twang colors the songs with his 60’s psychedelic-western flare, and drummers Edward Cerecedes, and later Dave Farina, whose thunderous tribal beats propel the songs soul-shaking precision. Jessi Williams’ lilting croon solidifies their signature sound built around male-female vocal harmonies. Their first EP, “Dead End,” launched them on a national tour, earned them airplay on college radio staples, KXLU and KUT, and critical success. Of the EP, The L.A. Times writes, “[The Lonely Wild] rustles up rustic guitar pop that’s equal parts sweet harmonies and power chord bombast.” Kevin Bronson of Buzzbands L.A. says, “[Dead End] is five songs of aching Americana that will stay with you long after you’ve cried in your beer.” And Beat Crave writes, “The Lonely Wild have a sound like no other […] the inexplicable heart and soul they put in their music is sure to have you hooked.” Coming off the success of “Dead End,” The Lonely Wild headed to The Hangar Studios in Sacramento where they would live, eat, and sleep for a week, to record their first full-length album. Midway through the sessions, they woke to the devastating news that their head engineer’s father had died, forcing him to leave. The fate of the record seemed uncertain. A day short and with a new engineer, The Lonely Wild worked consecutive sixteen, eighteen and twenty-four hour days to produce an album filled with gut-wrenching emotion, fragile beauty, and explosive energy — a band on the brink of delirium. “It was a true labor of love,” Carroll says, “and a sheer force of will, that allowed us to finish this record. We all knew it was the most important artistic statement we had ever made, so we had to pull out all the stops.” Upon finishing the record, the band headed to SXSW 2012, and returned home for the Jubilee and Make Music Pasadena festivals. The Lonely Wild will celebrate the release of their new single, “Buried In the Murder,” this September with a residency at The Satellite. “The Sun As It Comes,” is slated for release in early 2013.","<p class=""p1"">With songs that blaze through the dusty American West, quickly-rising L.A. quintet The Lonely Wild stand poised to release their debut LP, “The Sun As It Comes.” The first single from the record, “Buried In the Murder,” is a fistfight of a tune, thrusting the growl of singer Andrew Carroll against the bombastic guitar freakouts of Andrew Schneider.

Times writes, “[The Lonely Wild] rustles up rustic guitar pop that’s equal parts sweet harmonies and power chord bombast.” Kevin Bronson of Buzzbands L.A. says, “[Dead End] is five songs of aching Americana that will stay with you long after you’ve cried in your beer.” And Beat Crave writes, “The Lonely Wild have a sound like no other […] the inexplicable heart and soul they put in their music is sure to have you hooked.”<br> <br> Coming off the success of “Dead End,” The Lonely Wild headed to The Hangar Studios in Sacramento where they would live, eat, and sleep for a week, to record their first full-length album. Midway through the sessions, they woke to the devastating news that their head engineer’s father had died, forcing him to leave. The fate of the record seemed uncertain. A day short and with a new engineer, The Lonely Wild worked consecutive sixteen, eighteen and twenty-four hour days to produce an album filled with gut-wrenching emotion, fragile beauty, and explosive energy — a band on the brink of delirium. “It was a true labor of love,” Carroll says, “and a sheer force of will, that allowed us to finish this record. We all knew it was the most important artistic statement we had ever made, so we had to pull out all the stops.” <br> <br> Upon finishing the record, the band headed to <span class=""caps"">SXSW</span> 2012, and returned home for the Jubilee and Make Music Pasadena festivals. The Lonely Wild will celebrate the release of their new single, “Buried In the Murder,” this September with a residency at The Satellite. “The Sun As It Comes,” is slated for release in early 2013.</p></p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/5328919/807621877168d49bbd81196c9c9411de_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/qEYt9KPH2zs?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-memorials","The Memorials","BERKELEY, California","","The Memorials were spearheaded by Bay Area drumming prodigy, Thomas Pridgen, in December of 2009. After a few years performing with The Mars Volta, Thomas turned his attention to forming his own group, incorporating a range of styles as diverse as the experiences of the bands members. Instead of becoming another rock bands’ heartbeat, the focus was to collaborate with proficient musicians whom Thomas felt would fill a void he has heard in rock music throughout his life. Thomas reached out to friends and former students of the esteemed Berklee College of Music, Viveca Hawkins (vocals), and Nick Brewer (guitars), to join him in his newest endeavor. Recording with his friend’s yielded a family vibe that enabled a comfortable yet intense recording process. The groups’ assets were rounded out with the addition of a bass, organ, synthesizers, and multiple percussive elements. Thomas describes The Memorials’ first record as: “For me it was important to put a band together with my friends, and ya know, the record is a rollercoaster. Some songs are hard, but will make you cry by the end….” The aura of the recording sessions, and Thomas’ vision for the group, are reflected in the views of the bands members. Viveca Hawkins glows when speaking of the project: “We have totally made this project out of love…This album is made of the best of us, we put our hearts and souls into this.” The passion and intensity of the recording sessions is audible on The Memorials debut effort, as they combine a vast array of sounds atop Thomas and Nick’s compositions. Nick’s sprawling guitars and Thomas’ thick drums serve as the core of the sound, while Viveca’s voice brings it together perfectly. The end music is intelligent and calculated, exhibiting certain pop sensibilities within the scope of songs that rock out. The compositions highlight each musician’s incredible talent, while creating textured tracks that feel like vignettes of a band finding their stride.","<p>The Memorials were spearheaded by Bay Area drumming prodigy, Thomas Pridgen, in December of 2009.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/man-without-country","Man Without Country","Cardiff, Wales","electronica, electronic, shoegaze, dream pop","MWC are a thrilling modern duo with tour de force dynamics yet a lingering afterburn in both sound and vision. Their intensely atmospheric sonic palette combines manic and eerie synth pulses, glacial guitar ripples, heavy bass and haunting vocals that describe a relentlessly compelling world view – uneasy, heavy, confrontational. As MWC’s Tomas Greenhalf says, “You don’t know whether to dance to us or just listen to it, and wallow in it.” Greenhalf and Ryan James don’t think they’re alone in presenting the dark/uplifting paradox; they name check a handful of Scandinavian artists, such as The Knife, When Saints Go Machine and The Field. But none of them place such an emphasis on lyrics as MWC, and certainly none of them grew up in Wales. The way Man Without Country don’t belong in any one camp begins with their name, chosen because of a shared, “sense of not belonging.” Coming from remote parts of South Wales Greenhalf and James felt isolated and alienated by small-town life, and it was only after meeting on a popular music degree in 2006 that they discovered they weren’t alone. In fact, both admit the reason they were taking the course, they say, was, “to find other musicians.” For months, they exchanged emails of “audio snippets,” and with common ground established, the duo rented a rehearsal space to take one step further. “We were new to electronics so spent a lot of time experimenting with sounds” confesses Greenhalf, who was playing piano and saxophone at the time. A major fan of Eno and Stockhausen, and inheriting his parents’ love of Pink Floyd – “it’s that sheer epic and moody nature of the music” – Greenhalf was then writing more instrumental music, but after meeting James, he found a partner who could turn his music into structured songs. James, who says he was a bit of a metalhead in his early teen years, discovered Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service when he was 16: “That’s when I first realised the sort of music that was my calling, and that I wanted to sing. I hadn’t realised before how creative and upfront you could be with lyrics and poetry, which took me down a different road.” But it wasn’t until they decided to “become more of a band,” by adding a drummer that real progress was made, and 18 months after those first email exchanges, Man Without Country played its first live show. Three years later, MWC have refined and broadened their epic, piercing musical vistas drenched in visceral, gut-level poetry. The band name comes from Kurt Vonnegut’s essay collection A Man Without A Country (A Memoir Of Life In George W Bush’s America) from 2005, and like Vonnegut, James tends to looks at life aghast, with an air of anger, satire and sadness. But these are hard times, with lines drawn between opposing forces. And the name of MWC’s debut album? A very simple Foe and more evidence of the duo’s deep-seated alienation. When it comes to explaining lyrics, James can be very guarded. “Some lyrics are more personal” he says, “and some are more ambiguous than others”. But he’s willing to lay down some clues. For starters, the album’s title track: “Foe sums up the lyrics of the whole album, a very short three-letter word, for a quite hateful album.” From direct accusations (“I’m so embarrassed that I carry your name” in “Closet Addicts Anonymous”) to more oblique attack (“lower lifeboats as you sail through murky water, wear your blindfold, ball and chain. August daughter”. “Migrating Clay Pigeon”), the effect is chilling and alarming. MWC’s musical span follows suit: “King Complex” (the lead track of the EP that preceded Foe) is as fast and full-on an attack (“your head is like a lost balloon, drifting through the clouds”) as “Ebb & Flow” is slow and imbued with a loneliness you can almost taste (“my soul’s being sold in every note I hold”). But again, these tracks were chosen for their shared continuity of sound, “there’s a feel to the music that matches the lyrics,” says Greenhalf. “The music is often moody, dark and melancholic, usually in minor keys. But there are also some uplifting passages which emphasize the poignancy of the lyrics”. For such a dynamic sound, it’s impressive that Foe was recorded in their bedrooms, save for drums and some guitar that needed better and bigger facilities. But Foe has a secret weapon, namely legendary producer Ken Thomas, who agreed to mix the album – along with MWC – because he loved the songs. Greenhalf: “We’d never had any outside involvement in our work, so it was good to have an impartial point of view, to bring a fresh perspective on the music. We’re fans of not only Sigur Rós but M83 and Cocteau Twins, and Ken’s collaborated with all of them. His work with punk and post-punk bands like Psychic TV, 23 Skidoo and Clock DVA is also relevant to the outcome of Foe, we wanted that edge and energy, to prevent the songs from sounding too clean and clinical”. Thomas’ influence can be felt in the slowly building tidal wave that is “Inflammable Heart” and the gnarly intensity of “Migrating Clay Pigeon,” but also the softer synthscape of “Clipped Wings” and the ambient, lengthy “Parity”. But MWC aren’t content with creating a sound and leaving it there. When it comes to live shows, says Greenhalf, “we want to treat the songs differently, to exaggerate and lengthen different elements, so that it’s a unique live experience.“ Mike Monaghan is MWC’s live drumming powerhouse, though MWC also sometimes play without drums, as a more minimalist duo, “to vary the sound even more. It gives everything more room to breathe and picks out the subtleties.” From stormy to subtle, swooning to haunting, scorching to soothing, Man Without Country are many things. Yet they stand alone in modern music. Get to know thy enemy… ENDS.","<p><span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">MWC</span></span> are a thrilling modern duo with tour de force dynamics yet a lingering afterburn in both sound and vision. Their intensely atmospheric sonic palette combines manic and eerie synth pulses, glacial guitar ripples, heavy bass and haunting vocals that describe a relentlessly compelling world view – uneasy, heavy, confrontational. As <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">MWC</span></span>’s Tomas Greenhalf says, “You don’t know whether to dance to us or just listen to it, and wallow in it.”</p> <p>Greenhalf and Ryan James don’t think they’re alone in presenting the dark/uplifting paradox; they name check a handful of Scandinavian artists, such as The Knife, When Saints Go Machine and The Field. But none of them place such an emphasis on lyrics as <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">MWC</span></span>, and certainly none of them grew up in Wales. The way Man Without Country don’t belong in any one camp begins with their name, chosen because of a shared, “sense of not belonging.” Coming from remote parts of South Wales Greenhalf and James felt isolated and alienated by small-town life, and it was only after meeting on a popular music degree in 2006 that they discovered they weren’t alone. In fact, both admit the reason they were taking the course, they say, was, “to find other musicians.”</p> <p>For months, they exchanged emails of “audio snippets,” and with common ground established, the duo rented a rehearsal space to take one step further. “We were new to electronics so spent a lot of time experimenting with sounds” confesses Greenhalf, who was playing piano and saxophone at the time. A major fan of Eno and Stockhausen, and inheriting his parents’ love of Pink Floyd – “it’s that sheer epic and moody nature of the music” – Greenhalf was then writing more instrumental music, but after meeting James, he found a partner who could turn his music into structured songs.</p> <p>James, who says he was a bit of a metalhead in his early teen years, discovered Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service when he was 16: “That’s when I first realised the sort of music that was my calling, and that I wanted to sing.

Instead, they pay homage to the influences of the Queens, Kings and Godfather of Soul, while making music that is fresh, original and undeniably hip-shakin’. In 2010, Austin, TX vocalists Sonya Benjamin and Kara Knorpp had sweet soul songs in their pockets and big ideas in their heads – they just needed a band to bring it together. At the same time, guitarist Jon Fichter, keyboardist Max Werkenthin, drummer Gabe Yukon and bassist Chris Hadley were gigging around town as Bigfoot, an instrumental soul band reminiscent of Booker T. & the MGs and the Meters. Their original compositions and quality instrumentation were turning heads, but they kept hearing, “You guys are great…but you should add vocals.” Some might call it fate, others might call it Craigslist, but when Sonya and Kara met the guys from Bigfoot, the chemistry was immediate and palpable. The girls would sing a melody, the guys would jump in with the music, and before long they were knockin’ out originals left and right. Knowing that they were on to something big together, they joined forces to become The LaRues. The LaRues came out swinging in the summer of 2011 by adding a third vocalist, Sharon Grant, recording an EP and proceeding to pack bar after bar. The LaRues were recently named one of the Top 10 Best New Local Acts by the critics in the Austin Chronicle.","<p> <p></p><p>The LaRues are not a throwback band.

He spent his early years moving from one small town to the next and picked up the guitar at age16, in an effort to mend his first broken heart. Graham finished high school in Wichita Falls, TX and attended Hendrix College, Arkansas, in pursuit of a fine arts and music degree. He decided to take a needed break before graduation and traveled to the Greek islands of Mykonos and Paros located in the Agean Sea where he worked at a diesel jet-engine power plant, mingled among the locals and played his music in the streets. After gaining the life experiences desired, he completed his degree in 2002. He then set out upon another quest and traveled half way around the world to the Micronesian island of Pohnpel, where he volunteered as an English teacher in the local Jesuit school. While overseas, his older brother and best friend Aaron Robert Wilkinson passed away in New York City. By far, his brother’s death was the most difficult thing his family and he have faced. His brothers influence is easily identified in many of Graham’ songs .You see, Aaron was singing and writing in lower east side coffee shops, on the cusp of the Anti-folk scene. Hanging out with the soon to be recognized Regina Spektor, Kimya Dawson, Adam Green from the Moldy Peaches and the guys from The Strokes. The Strokes went on to dedicate their second album “Room on Fire” to Aaron and all of these musicians continue to make appearances at the Annual Memorial concert held in NYC every July. Aaron’s death lead Graham back to the “states”. “Had Aaron not passed away, I may never have returned from my volunteer work on Pohnpel”, he stated. It was truly a crossroad in his journey, as he immediately knew upon returning to Texas that he had to move to Austin to make “his music”. The first few years in Austin allowed Graham the opportunities to broaden his musical horizons from leading a punk rock outfit to collaborating on an old-time/bluegrass quintet. Unable to be pinned to one genre, Graham began developing a lineup of interchangeable artists known as the Underground Township. Graham has now found the sound he has been searching for with the current Underground Township lineup and it’s reflective on his new album “YEARBOOK”. It’s been well received by leading Austin radio stations KUT and KGSR and 12 other stations through out the country. “YEARBOOK” features such artists as Alejandro Escovedo (No Depression magazine Artist of the Decade), Hayes Carll (Top played Americana Record of 2009), and Lloyd Maines (Multi-Grammy winning producer/and father of Natalie Maines). The depth of his influences and breadth of his worldly experiences, are unmistakable in this diverse collection of heart thumping tunes. From ska to folk, honky-tonk to rock, his lyrics tackle such lofty and often neglected topics as social responsibility and justice, political corruption and greed while consoling the audience with pithy love songs and pure ‘feel good’ rhythms and melodies. Though seen as the debut of this young songwriter one must know this is not all we will hear and see from Graham, but rather an incredible step towards a successful musical journey.","<p>Graham Edward Wilkinson was born in 1980 in the small East Texas town of Denison to a Methodist minister father and a speech pathologist mother.

The mixture is unique, yet reminiscent of earlier reggae and ska bands with the talent and attitude to forge a DIY path to success, such as Sublime, The Mad Caddies and Reel Big Fish. One listen to their music hooks like an addictive habit, with solid rhythm sections and memorable hooks that draw you to listen again and again. The Uglies are a band that makes music appealing to both hardcore music fans and casual listeners who want an easy listen, both of whom will hear something different in every listen. The Uglies have earned residencies at several venues in the Mid Atlantic region, and have been spreading their sound at live shows around the country since 2009. Their music and popularity has organically spread throughout the East Coast, and 2011 and beyond will see Bumpin’ Uglies touring new cities around the nation, spreading their trademark laid back yet precise live performances. The Uglies have the mettle to carry the torch of the reggae/ska/rock genre into the future; to be the band that builds its own success simply by delivering memorable music from their souls; music which listeners can relate to and fully embrace. Bumpin’ Uglies released their debut LP, Free Candy, in June of 2011. Not since Sublime was selling 40 oz. to Freedom out of the back of their van has an independent LP surprised the listening public with such well-crafted and prolific sounds. Free Candy dares to feel accessible and raw in a rootsy sense, with real, sparkling talent and versatility giving the entire album excellent shape and allure throughout. Lead singer and song writer, Brandon Hardesty proudly claims that, “Free Candy is music for people with real lives and real problems. Most of the songs are based on experiences I’ve had throughout my twenties, so I think there are themes in the songs that most people can relate to.”via Facebook","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; line-height: 14px;"">Annapolis, MD based Bumpin’ Uglies (also known as the Uglies) are deliberately carving out their own captivating niche in the rock/reggae scene.

Right now we are finishing up an EP’s worth of songs that will be released October 16th. We won’t be touring or playing any more shows as Smoosh, but have kept the Smoosh website and Facebook https://www.facebook.com/pages/Smoosh/114328581933722 so that we can still communicate with you all about our past music. We’re so excited to begin this new project. We are calling it a ‘project’ because it is an experiment —we are trying to embody this idea of going all out with everything, including our everyday lives. We’re changing ourselves —like the giant amoeba that is a ‘chaos chaos’. Haha. There’s been an amoeba at the core of our music, where the form is always changing, moving in different directions. We can’t wait to continue doing this project. The process has already been so much fun and quite an adventure. Imagine a giant amoeba. If you can’t do that just imagine a giant blob. That’s what music is right now. Something that is always there and always changing –and it can be turned into anything. Chloe: Percussion makes you feel a song rather than just hear it. Percussion drives. It can drive someone to kill, to dance, to make love, to take risks, or to free themselves. Percussion for the people! On a typical New York day you’ll hear music and percussion over 50 times. You can’t get away from it, actually. Or maybe that’s just New York. A day without music would be dull and depressing. With all this different music surrounding YOU, what you take from it is unique and individual. Music is personal, but also shared –it’s this huge never-ending cycle. Asy: I kind of feel like I am 65 right now, though I also feel 12. I’ve been working on my songwriting for 14 years now, but I approach songwriting like a kid looking for an adventure. Because of this combination my songwriting is a collision of patience and impulse. This is a really interesting time for me. Recently, I became restless. Had an early midlife crisis… I absolutely needed to experience more and take more risks (in songwriting and in other parts of my life). I decided to become my own student of music, listening to many different genres and styles and taking bits of things as I went, eventually blending them into a giant smoothie that I poured into my songs. I let myself be honest, which was hard because that meant entering an uncomfortable place, where a light was shined on everything (even unspeakable things). Right now I like to write music the way I live life—like a risk junkie. I’ve somehow convinced myself to keep getting uncomfortable. I think this should be the year of discomfort—for everybody—because when you challenge yourself to do something that’s risky or a little uncomfortable you won’t ever regret it. Well. Maybe sometimes you would. BUT, that risk will push you to a new place in your life—a place that’s meaningful and chaotic in a good way. For me this place is the amoeba place, —the always changing, always full of possibilities place. Chaos Chaos. Wooh! -Asy and Chloe","<p>Chaos Chaos is Asy and Chloe (formerly of Smoosh).

After playing a few shows they ultimately broke up. Mark and Bob still stayed together in search for a new band. This opportunity came one night when Bob met up with Curtis who had minor experience with bands. He and Curtis decided to start a band. Of course Mark got dragged into the picture. The frameworks for the final project were coming together. All they needed was a bassist. Bob and Mark had known Max from years before and had found out that he played the guitar. They asked Max to take up the bass and he gladly took the opportunity. They got together one day; started playing White Room and The Last of the Independents was born. They have been together for about a year now. More recently after an exhausting search for a vocalist the stumbled upon Bob’s longtime co-worker and friend, John Cross. We are currently writing and rewriting our songs to incorporate vocals. Bobby Driscoll – Bobby had been playing guitar for 3 years. He is heavily influenced by Rory Gallagher and Stevie Ray Vaughan. He is also influenced by the sounds of Freddie King, Dave Hole, and Ronnie Earl. He currently is living in New Orleans but is returning to Massachusetts for the summer. Mark Loud – Mark has been playing guitar since he was 12. he has had a very strong passion for music ever since he was a kid. His influences are Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Freddie King, and many others. He has also been a practitioner of the Martial Arts since the age of 7 and is currently working as an instructor. Some of his favorite activities are to go to the movies, read comic books, and hanging out with his friends. Curtis Manning – Curtis has been playing the drums for about 6 years. He first started playing for the high school band in the 8th grade. Playing music is Curtis’ favorite thing to do and probably always will be. Aside from playing music he enjoys to longboard around town, or go to the beach and skimboard. He also enjoys an occasional round of golf. Currently enrolled in Keene State College in Keene, New Hampshire. Majoring in communication and with music technology on the side. He hopes to one day open his own recording studio. Until then he plans to keep playing music and doing what he loves as much as he can. Max Martelli – Max had started playing the guitar 3 years prior to the band. He was approached by the others to play bass and has since been dabbling in both. While being both inspired by a plethora of artists and songwriters, he is heavily influenced by guitarist Pete Townshend and Bassist John Entwistle. He is currently living in Massachusetts.","<p>It started with Mark and Bob. They had been in a band called The Blueshift. After playing a few shows they ultimately broke up.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/guards","Guards","New York, NY","indie, indie pop, lo-fi","After leading the Willowz for eight years, Richie Follin needed a break. Not from playing music, but from everything that goes along with running a band. He had started playing in his sister Madeline’s project Cults, and having less on his plate felt great at first. “Cults wasn’t really my band, I was just the guitar player and there to support my little sister and friends. So that was a great release, just to have time away from having to be focused on running everything.” But after a while he couldn’t help himself. Follin and Loren Humphrey, who drummed in both Willowz and Cults, demoed some songs for possible inclusion on the next Cults record. He was “gonna wait and see if they want to use them first, but the process of them making an album was a year and a half. It was a long, long thing. So I was sitting on them and ended up singing on them.” Happy with the results, Follin posted his collaborations with Madeline and Chairlift singer Caroline Polachek. “They both Tweeted about it after I put up the page, so it was all over the internet. It just started building, but I didn’t have a band. It was me who played everything on it, recorded it, produced it, and so we started getting offers to play shows and people were calling and labels and all that stuff just from the internet. So we got asked to play a show at CMJ. That was the first show I put a band together for.” Direct and punchy but sprinkled with hints of folky British psychedelia and California sunshine, Follin knew the songs he and Humphrey made were different than anything he had done before. Their friend Kaylie Church joined in, and the trio got to work on making their first album as Guards. “I had never stopped recording music the entire time since that EP came out, so we had four albums worth of songs and it really just came down to picking the best songs and it happened to be the most current songs that we ended up with.” Follin pulled from the shimmer and shine of ‘70’s power pop groups, the big guitar choruses of Grunge, some psych rock, the straight ahead drive of ‘60’s rock and soul, and a little bit of early ‘80’s New Wave while making In Guards We Trust, but he and mixer Shane Stoneback were intent on making certain the album sounded like more than the sum of its influences. “If you treat a song a certain way, no matter how modern the style of song, it could sound like it’s from 1968,” he says. “I want to have that feeling there, but I want it to sound modern and of its time. So if you go back 30 years you’ll know that’s from 2013.” Making it sound of its time took some time. Follin spent months finding the right approach for In Guards We Trust, a process that saw him rethink all the tricks he had grown to rely on. “The way I was writing stuff kind of changed. I was writing less on the guitar and some of the songs were just built around a drum loop,” he says, “Some were written on the piano and I’m not really a piano player. And some of them were just built around the atmosphere of this guitar pedal effect, which I had never really done that way before.” Recording was then delayed when he accidentally broke his jaw, but things finally snapped in to place when he unintentionally wrote the album’s single “Ready To Go.” “I was pretty much thinking the album was done. I started playing this song, just started messing around, doing random chord changes, sitting in my room, pretending I was playing this gigantic festival to a sea of people in the summer, and it just slowly kind of developed from that,” he says. “I started rewriting it and it guided the rest of the album, I think. “The verse is just about when Kaylie and I first met. We were in San Francisco and those hills are super steep and we had my van full of people but everyone was afraid to pull my car out of the parking space, and Kaylie did it, so I kind of drew from that. The chorus was about being ‘up and ready to go’ in more ways than one which is something I think a lot of people can relate to.” -Michael Tedder","<p>After leading the Willowz for eight years, Richie Follin needed a break.

Pronounced “alt-J”, the delta sign is created when you hold down the alt key on your computer keyboard and punch ‘J’ on a Mac computer. The symbol has a deeper meaning for the band, as guitarist/bassist Gwil Sainsbury notes, “in mathematical equations it’s used to show change,” and the band’s relatively new name came at a turning point in their lives. Gwil, Joe Newman [guitar/vocals], Gus Unger-Hamilton [keyboards] and Thom Green [drums] met at Leeds University in 2007. Gus studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art. In their second year of studies, Joe played Gwil a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Gwil acting as producer on Garageband. Needless to say, the response to Joe’s hushed falsetto yelps and Gwil’s rudimentary sampling skills was good. When Thom was played the tracks he joined the band straight away. “I hadn’t heard anything like it,” he says. “It was music I was looking for, I just didn’t know I was. I just loved it.” Gus completed the band’s lineup and together – first as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as Films – the four friends spent the next two years playing around town, developing a precise and unique brand of alt. pop that draws on poignant folk verses, crushing synths, smart hip hop syncopations and tight vocal harmonies. They dropped the moniker of Films in 2007, largely to avoid confusing the band with Californian punk troupe The Films. alt-J gave them a unique name to go with the unique ‘folk-step’ that they now concoct in the basement of a terrace house in Cambridgeshire. Admiration and favourable comparisons have come thick and fast for alt-J. Before the release of their instantly sold out debut single on Loud And Quiet last October, the band were described as “Nick Drake meets Gangsta Rap,” and they were likened to Wild Beasts, ‘In Rainbows’ era Radiohead, The xx and Anthony & The Johnsons – acts acclaimed for their ability to create the kind of patient, sophisticated, intricate music that alt-J do. An early demo of the skittish, euphoric ‘Breezeblocks’ gained healthy radio play without even being released and alt-J’s Soundcloud generated over 70,000 plays in its first 6 months with little to no promotion. From Joe’s high soul cry and Thom’s refusal to drum with cymbals (he started with saucepans because he couldn’t fit a full drum kit in Gwil’s bedroom where the band first practiced), to the sparse guitars and Gus’ delicate key clunks on songs like ‘Bloodflood’, a neat sound-bite for alt-j’s music is yet to be coined, and perhaps never will be. And by challenging what constitutes folk, hip hop, indie and pop music, the band have quickly found themselves in the studio at the beginning of 2012, recording their debut album for Infectious Music with long-time producer Charlie Andrew (Micachu & The Shapes, Eugene McGuinness). Veering wildly from psychedelic avant pop to skeletal folktronica, the finished album promises to trade in understated beauty one minute and epic oddities the next, just as you’d expect from a debut album that tackles everything from love to bullfighting to the heroic life of 1930s war photographer Gerda Taro, crushed by a tank on the frontline. Other tracks are inspired by cinema, including ‘Matilda’ (about Natalie Portman’s character in Luc Besson’s Leon) and the Good The Bad And The Ugly-referencing ‘Tessellate’.","<p>alt-J’s name takes a little explaining.

The funky psych-pop of 2011’s Underneath the Pine evinced an artist who could create similar atmospheres even without the aid of source material and drum machines. His Freaking Out EP, a handful of singles and remixes, and a retrospective box-set plot points all along the producer-songwriter spectrum in which he’s worked since his debut, and his third full-length, Anything In Return, sees him poised directly in the middle of the two. The product of a move to Berkeley, CA and the subsequent extended separation from loved ones, Anything in Return shows a pervasive sense of peace with Bundick’s tendency to dabble in both sides of the modern music-making spectrum, and he sounds comfortable engaging in intuitive pop production, putting forth the impression of unmediated id. The producer’s hand is prominent—not least in the sampled “yeah”s and “uh”s that give the album a hip-hop-indebted confidence— and many of the songs feature the 4/4 beats and deftly employed effects usually associated with house music. Tracks like “High Living” and “Day One” show a considerably Californian influence, their languid funk redolent of a decidedly West Coast temperament, and elsewhere—not least on lead single, “So Many Details”— the record plays with darker atmospheres than we’re used to hearing from Toro Y Moi. Sounding quite assured in what some may call this songwriter’s return to producer-hood, Anything in Return is Bundick uninhibited by issues of genre, an album that feels like the artist’s essence.","<p>Since his first offerings began making the Internet rounds in 2009, Toro Y Moi’s Chaz Bundick has proven himself to be not just a prolific musician, but a diverse one as well, letting each successive release broaden the scope of the his oeuvre.

It was, Aino says quite reasonably, “the best thing that ever happened”. So the day after the best thing that ever happened happened, these two girls from the Stockholm suburbs formed a electronic pop duo band, and on the Monday – when the hangovers had cleared and it still all seemed like the best thing that had ever happened – they booked their first gig – Icona Pop was born. This felt all very well, but then they realised they had four weeks until their gig, but no songs. Autumn of 2011, Icona Pop moved from Stockholm to London, and with an album ready to go the tunes are in no short supply. Icona Pop says: “We like galloping drums, and synthesisers, but we still like the classical pop melodies. And that’s ‘what we are’. We don’t have to decide, because there’s no decision to be made. We just have to do exactly what we want.” In the intervening years they’ve working with The Knocks (voted one of NME’s hottest production outfits of the hour), Patrik Berger (Robyn), Elof Loelv (Niki & The Dove), Fredrik Berger (The Good Natured) and Style of Eye, as well as sessions with UK producers like Starsmith (Kylie, Ellie Goulding) and Burns. Their Neon Gold-released double a-side single ‘Manners’ / ‘Top Rated’ prompted journals like NME and The Guardian say things along the lines of “effortlessly cool” and “all the makings of a 24-carat pop hit”, and the duo have perfected their live show, too – that first performance back in 2009 went rather well, all things considered, while their first London gig was impressive enough to bag them a management deal with Artist Company TEN, the team behind Niki & The Dove and Erik Hassle. There’s plenty more of this evocative stuff right across Icona Pop’s as-yet-untitled debut album, due out in 2012. Effervescently romantic number ‘Sun Goes Down’ is a Knocks collaboration written on a trip to New York. “We both had a crush at home,” Caroline recalls, “and we were thinking about our lovely men on the other side of the ocean, singing, ‘I will be waiting for you until the sun goes down’.” The sound of it all is hard to pinpoint, but there are some unmistakeable Madonnaisms on spirited anthem ‘Beat The L’. So that original plan for Caroline to give Aino her best night ever? Well, that night they met in 2009 has since been immortalised in song, on the vivid and joyous ‘Nights Like This’ Caroline explains, “everything that night was like magic, and the lyric ‘nights like this, you will never be alone’, is what Icona Pop is all about. It’s about being together and having fun, and inviting as many people as possible because the best nights out are the ones you want to share with everyone.” As nights out go, Icona Pop’s first must of one of pop’s most vital, and it’s still in full effect three years later. In fact, it feels like it’s just getting going. “We’re having so much fun all the time,” Aino smiles. “It’s kind of scary.”","<p>Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt met on a Saturday night in February 2009.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/macklemore-and-ryan-lewis","Macklemore & Ryan Lewis","SEATTLE, Washington, US","","Macklemore holds a singular place in both the Pacific Northwest and now across the country as he emerges as a premier national hip-hop artist with numerous career highlights to his name. A genuine lyricist and a captivating performer, Macklemore, with his DJ/production partner Ryan Lewis, have garnered critical acclaim, a devoted fan base, and a steadily growing anticipation for their upcoming work.Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ music is distinct for channeling cultural moments and refreshingly self-aware testimony through candid lyricism and expertly crafted composition. Their work has impressed and enthused a multitude of listeners, nowhere more evident than in the populist barometer of the internet, where some of Macklemore’s songs, videos and even fan-uploaded media have over one million listens and views. The recent single “Wings” is an anthemic meditation on being of the Air Jordan generation with a lucid perspective on an otherwise trodden motif. “Otherside” offers a darkly searing portrait of his own story of addiction and the hype of substance within hip-hop culture. Crowd-favorite songs like “And We Danced” and “Irish Celebration” demonstrate Macklemore’s ability to get raucous with disarming candor and relentlessly energetic showmanship.On their first national headlining tour in the spring of 2011, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis packed houses and sold out a majority of their shows, including those in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and a three-night run at Seattle’s Showbox at the Market, where over 3,500 tickets sold out in less than 48 hours.Macklemore’s freshman release in 2005, Language of My World, featured production by Rhymesayer’s Budo and was well-received by circles who noted Macklemore’s fresh perspective and a striking balance of insight and levity. After several subsequent years of artistic stagnation and frustration due to substance abuse, Macklemore made a commitment to sobriety with a newfound, more intrinsic dedication to his music. The catalyst to this change was establishing a partnership and ongoing collaboration with Ryan Lewis, an accomplished, consummate artist in design, photography, and production, who also acts as Macklemore’s touring DJ. They released the VS EP in 2009 & VS Redux in 2010, the latter reaching #7 on the iTunes Hip Hop charts.The pair has been featured at a significant number of major festivals and showcases, including the 2011 Rock The Bells Tour, Soundset (MN), MusicFest NW (OR), Bumbershoot (Seattle), Sasquatch (WA), Outside Lands (San Francisco), and a much-talked about run at SXSW, including a set at the Fader Fort. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis also performed their tribute song “My Oh My” at the Seattle Mariners home opener on April 8, 2011, at Safeco Field for over 40,000 attendees. Publication appearances of note include a “Show-And-Prove” feature in XXL Magazine, front-page feature on the Seattle Times and the cover of City Arts Magazine.Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are now hard at work on their first full-length album as well as a 7” that will feature two new songs later on this year. For all the thresholds that they’ve crossed—always bolstered by the loyalty and love of listeners and fans—the momentum that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis have generated makes their breakthrough to new heights imminent.#sharkfacegangvia Facebook","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">Macklemore holds a singular place in both the Pacific Northwest and now across the country as he emerges as a premier national hip-hop artist with numerous career highlights to his name.

With their whimsical tunes about astral phenomena and spider bites, Merry Prankster-style stage antics, and a frontman with a voice that evokes Neil Young on nitrous oxide, the Oklahoma City band managed to build a cult following that exploded into something bigger in the late Nineties and 2000s.Melodically, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titles—such as “Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus with Needles”, ""Free Radicals (A Hallucination of the Christmas Skeleton Pleading with a Suicide Bomber)"" and “Yeah, I Know It’s a Drag… But Wastin’ Pigs Is Still Radical”. They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne’s signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of the “50 Bands to See Before You Die”.The group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a hit in 1993 with “She Don’t Use Jelly”. Although it has been their only hit single in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999’s The Soft Bulletin (which was NME magazine’s Album of the Year) and 2002’s Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe than in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award in the “Best International Act” category. By 2007, the group garnered three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.On October 13, 2009 the group released their latest studio album, titled Embryonic. On December 22, 2009, the Flaming Lips released a remake of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side Of The Moon. In 2011, the band announced plans to release new songs in every month of the year, with the entire process filmed.","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "" class=""wysiwyg-color-black"">The Flaming Lips are an American rock band, formed in Norman, Oklahoma in 1983.</span><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; ""><br></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; ""><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: 12px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal; ""><span class=""wysiwyg-color-black"">The weirder, jokier and more indulgent the Flaming Lips get, the more their fans seem to love them.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-joy-formidable","The Joy Formidable","Wrexham, Wales","indie, female vocalists, indie rock","Not a lot goes down in Casco, Maine. In the winter months, this sequestered hamlet around 30 miles from Portland in the North Easternmost tip of the United States acquires a Siberian stillness as suffocating snow descends and carpets this eerily remote and reclusive region. Yet it was to a forest just outside Casco that The Joy Formidable singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan and bassist Rhydian Dafydd retired at the start of 2012 to dream up their magnificent second album, Wolf’s Law, a record that teems with imagination, yearning and a Carpe Diem restlessness. “It was just the two of us in this isolated spot where we hardly saw anybody else all the time we were there,” says Ritzy. “It snowed every day and the surroundings and the solitude gave us a different level of intensity. “We had no phone signal, no wi-fi – it was fucking bliss! It is Stephen King country up there and we worried that we’d turn into The Shining and cave each other’s heads in. But it was very still, very beautiful – and in a strange way it reminded us of our home area of North Wales.” Wolf’s Law is a driven, hugely emotive record, an alluring and attitudinal follow-up to The Joy Formidable’s keenly received 2011 debut, The Big Roar. It’s an album that was recorded in very different circumstances to its predecessor, both geographically and emotionally. “We had a very difficult period in our personal lives making The Big Roar,” says Rhydian. “Ritzy’s parents were going through a very painful, long-drawn-out divorce and also we lost both close friends and family. We made it in very tight, enclosed studio spaces and it made it a very frustrated and aggressive record. “With Wolf’s Law, some of the difficult personal circumstances have been resolved, so while there is still aggression there, the record is a lot more harmonious and focussed. It helped that we were completely lost in nature in Maine because it is really an album about reconnecting – with yourself, with nature and with spirituality.” Such heavyweight and profound themes run through Wolf’s Law like a pulse. The album’s audacious reach and ambition is clear in the extraordinary film that The Joy Formidable commissioned for its title track: a breathtaking sequence of monochrome images of birth, death and the natural world. “That track (Wolf’s Law) was always meant as an art piece, we wanted to make a visual that introduced the mood of the record. It’s a song about encouragement, reawakening hope and knowing that time is precious,” says Ritzy. “It’s very aware of its own mortality and how fleeting a moment can be.” “It encapsulates the themes of the album,” agrees Rhydian. “It’s about how beautiful and cruel life can be and how it’s always moving, and also about seizing the moment, because life is short.” It’s evident that the stark serenity of snowbound Casco impacted on the marrow of Wolf’s Law. Themes of the raw beauty and majesty of nature are laced throughout the album. The buzzsaw, ragged yet beautifully melodic Cholla was inspired by the giant cacti of the Joshua Tree National Park, yet also details familial breakdowns; The Leopard and the Lung was written in honour of a doughty environmentalist campaigner. “It’s about a true hero – a Kenyan female activist, Wangari Maathai who fought against an entire corrupt establishment for nature and for women’s rights,” says Ritzy. “She was so fucking brave! Her name,Wangari, means leopard in Kukuru. She told Kenyan women to plant trees because she said that trees are the lungs of the earth.” Yet not all of the audacious, propulsive Wolf’s Law is about such extraneous matters. Although Ritzy and Rhydian have been a couple since before the making of The Big Roar, they have never previously referenced their relationship in song. On the taut Tendons, a shimmering rock reverie powered by the martial beat of Joy Formidable drummer Matt Thomas, they courageously affix their hearts firmly to their sleeves. “Rhydian and I were making music together before we became a couple, so we have never experienced our relationship outside of the bubble of this band,” muses Ritzy. “It can be a difficult dynamic to maintain and it sometimes makes me wonder – is our relationship based on the chaos of this band and our music, and if that were to change, where would it leave us?” “The tendons reference is because we’re so inextricably linked,” adds Rhydian. “This band and music join us so closely together; we’re soul mates, but could it destroy us as well?” Precarious relationships. Confessionals. Catharsis. The call of the wild. Life, birth, death and all points in-between. With such vast, profound and heartfelt themes, wrapped up in some of the most visceral and voluptuous art-rock-and-roll that has exploded since the halcyon days of the Pixies, it’s no surprise that a lot of people expect Wolf’s Law to be The Joy Formidable’s quantum-leap breakthrough album, a springboard to arena-filling status, this fiercely driven band’s tipping point into rock’s A-League. Are they ready for this? Is it even what they want? “If we can keep our artistic integrity,” says Ritzy, “and carry on writing songs that are important to us, and keep the thrill and the excitement of doing what we do, and carry on moving forward and evolving, and still manage to connect with an arena full of people – fuck it, that would be fantastic! But it’s not the reason why we do what we do. We won’t change to get there.” “That’s true,” agrees Rhydian. “The point is to reach as many people as possible – but for all the right reasons.” Their charming reticence may soon become immaterial. The Joy Formidable have made an album so colossal, so compelling that it may even put Casco, Maine on the map. If there is any justice in the world, 2013 will be the Year of the Wolf.","<p>Not a lot goes down in Casco, Maine.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/ra-ra-riot","Ra Ra Riot","Syracuse, NY","indie, indie rock, indie pop","Ra Ra Riot first met seven years ago while attending school in Syracuse, New York, and quickly graduated from basement rehearsals and student dance parties to blog buzz and press acclaim for their debut The Rhumb Line. After extensive touring for their meticulously recorded second record The Orchard and some membership changes, Ra Ra Riot decided to mix things up for their album Beta Love, leaving upstate New York for Sweet Tea, the Oxford, MS studio of producer Dennis Herring (Modest Mouse/Elvis Costello/Wavves). Herring pushed singer Wes Miles, guitarist Milo Bonacci, bassist Mathieu Santos and violinist Rebecca Zeller to embrace spontaneity and rethink their roles. The band recreated themselves on Beta Love, a collection of giddy pop songs and heady lyrics that pull inspiration from futurist Ray Kurzweil, among others. Gathered in their manager’s Williamsburg apartment, the band took a few moments to talk So the first thing I noticed listening to the album is that the longest song is three minutes and sixteen seconds. Was there a concentrated effort to get things as concise as possible this time around? Wes Miles: I think it was slightly a reaction from our last record. But I think it was secondary to the overall goal that the process should serve the song, rather than having long jams and stuff to showcase our musicianship. It’s more about the songs. Did you make a conscious effort to approach the songwriting differently? WM: With this record, I wanted to work with Dennis on pre-production to really find out what the songs were going to be, and from there do nothing that wouldn’t serve the songs. Sometimes we get handcuffed by “bring the demo to the band, then try to play it and then that’ll be the song.” Rebecca Zeller: Also we wanted for everyone to not go in knowing exactly what we’d be doing, like “I’m going to play violin on this one,” or “I’m playing bass.” It was a sense of putting away our…. Milo Bonacci: Egos RZ: Egos and pre-defined roles. It was amazing how quickly we were able to put that stuff aside and focus on the fun of making music without worrying about anything else. MB: The idea that “nothing is precious” really set the tone for all of us, how we felt about our contributions or whatever. Anything can change at any moment. I felt like we spent two albums incubating these little ideas we had and it got to the point where they would become so precious that nothing was excludable, but in a weird way we had also limited the sonic spaces we were operating in for those albums. And for this album you guys were down to a four-piece. How did that affect the way you wrote songs and approached the recording process? WM: Well, the four of us are pretty different to begin with and once everyone was able to buy into this idea of “you’re gonna have to just roll with the punches,” I think it helped everyone look past “oh, where is my role?” You sort of just figure it out. RZ: On both The Rhumb Line and The Orchard we all sat down and we jammed through these songs, and it wasn’t a question of “does this song need strings?” It was “what is the string part going to be for this?” And so approaching these songs it was really thinking, as Wes said, “what does this song need? What serves this song the best?” I was so excited for the “Dance With Me” string part, which is just two notes. Doing something so simple seemed fun and effective. MS: Becca would be working with string parts and she’d send demos to all of us and it felt more of a collaborative discussion where we’re all on the same page all the time, where in the past it seemed like the string department was… MB: Departmentalized. MS: Yeah. And we didn’t really allow ourselves to really reach out across to each other. How much of this album is you guys reacting to your previous worries of preciousness? Were you consciously trying to react against whatever images people may have of you or you may have had of yourself? RZ: Back in Syracuse, in the early days, our roots were that we’d play these dance parties and everybody would be dancing and I guess we sort of strayed from that with The Orchard. MB: We started thinking too much about it. But in some ways I feel this record is more similar to how we approached things when we first started. Using our gut reaction to things and more immediate sort of decisionmaking. WM: We always liked making music that moves people physically So, Wes, you went out and worked with Dennis on demos first for a little while before the rest of the band came out. Tell me a little more about that process. WM: I didn’t know what to expect going down there at first, but he told me to “bring an open mind and a positive attitude” and my little Casio keyboard. We had sent him a few early, early demos. I didn’t know which ones we’d be working on. So I got there and he basically just set me up in their little edit suite at Sweet Tea Studios. We went down the list and were like “which ones would be fun to work on this week?” We would work for a few hours together and then he’d leave me in there to shape things on my own and sing things or improvise or cut things up and then he’d come back the next morning. He’d go on the computer and cut things up or tell me which things he really liked and where things could be thrown away. It was really active editing and recording and we ended up basically completing a demo every day that I was there. For the songwriting process, there’s a lot of letting go of control and trying to be in the moment and not have firm ideas of what’s going on. Lyrically, did that kind of transfer over? WM: Yeah, yeah it did. In the past I would have been afraid to write a lot of the lyrics that I wrote on this record, because a lot of them are sort of specific and weird about science fiction or inspired by specific people. The attitude in general was to let go and to not worry so much and so basically if I thought something was interesting I’d just sort of go for it, whereas in the past it’s “is this a good thing to write a song about?” And usually I would compromise it to a degree, but I felt liberated by Dennis’ encouragement and the band’s encouragement to just go for whatever. So it was a lot of work, but it was a lot of fun, too. Looking back I’m very proud of the lyrics on this album. Tell me about “Binary Mind.” That definitely seems to have a lot of science fiction-as-emotional conflict metaphor in it. WM: Well, that song is about Ray Kurzweil. We got into him at the end of The Orchard. I majored in physics in college and I’ve always been interested in science-type things, so that was a very easy thing for me to get into and Mat was also really into that. MS: I ordered The Singularity Is Near. WM: It’s all about his mathematical extrapolations of estimating when humans and computers will merge and be indistinguishable. And there’s also a great documentary about him, sort of exploring that idea. MB: Transcendent Man. WM: Yeah, Transcendent Man. So we got really into him and his ideas. Watching the movie, you realize one of his biggest hopes for singularity is to sort of recreate his father. He has these boxes and boxes of his father’s legal and financial documents and personal writings and all these things he thinks are going to help create sort of an avatar of his dad when singularity happens. And meanwhile he’s racing against time in his own way, because according to his theory, singularity happens at a certain time and he’s battling human deterioration. So that’s basically what the song’s about, from his perspective, hoping when singularity happens, he’ll be able to sync with his computer and create his father, bring his father back to life, basically. I thought that was a really amazing, crazy, real life story. In a way, that seems the exact opposite of your mindset where you guys are trying to give up control, he’s trying to have control over death. Reminds me of “Dying Is Fine,” from your first album… So Beta Love is an interesting phrase – there’s the idea of beta as an in progress software program, not quite ready to go. There’s also the idea of a beta male, someone who’s less aggressive and more thoughtful than an alpha male. Was that a combination you’d go for in the lyrics? WM: To be perfectly honest, I hadn’t thought of the second meaning that you brought up. The lyrics for that song were finished pretty late. It was just a really exciting moment because it encapsulates a lot of other topics on the record. It’s supposed to be about this beta version of an android discovering love. But listening to it and writing the rest of the lyrics, it felt like it was really representative of everything. “Angel, Please” is probably the most danceable song on the record. How did it come about? WM: That was sort of a contentious one in the studio, because we weren’t really sure how to go about it. It was much slower in demo and had this meandering melody that of course Dennis wasted no time getting us to trim down. MS: Dennis called us all into the control room and he played us OutKast’s “Hey Ya!” and then he was like… WM: “Let’s just all go super happy, super positive.” Is that a change of pace for you? Being positive and happy? WM: No, but it was challenging us to be even more happy and positive. MB: Just like, really go for it. WM: Just don’t hold back. -Michael Tedder","<p>Ra Ra Riot first met seven years ago while attending school in Syracuse, New York, and quickly graduated from basement rehearsals and student dance parties to blog buzz and press acclaim for their debut The Rhumb Line. After extensive touring for their meticulously recorded second record The Orchard and some membership changes, Ra Ra Riot decided to mix things up for their album Beta Love, leaving upstate New York for Sweet Tea, the Oxford, MS studio of producer Dennis Herring (Modest Mouse/Elvis Costello/Wavves).</p> <p>Herring pushed singer Wes Miles, guitarist Milo Bonacci, bassist Mathieu Santos and violinist Rebecca Zeller to embrace spontaneity and rethink their roles. The band recreated themselves on Beta Love, a collection of giddy pop songs and heady lyrics that pull inspiration from futurist Ray Kurzweil, among others. Gathered in their manager’s Williamsburg apartment, the band took<br /> a few moments to talk</p> <p>So the first thing I noticed listening to the album is that the longest song is three minutes and sixteen seconds. Was there a concentrated effort to get things as concise as possible this time around?</p> <p>Wes Miles: I think it was slightly a reaction from our last record. But I think it was secondary to the overall goal that the process should serve the song, rather than having long jams and stuff to showcase our musicianship. It’s more about the songs.</p> <p>Did you make a conscious effort to approach the songwriting differently?</p> <p>WM: With this record, I wanted to work with Dennis on pre-production to really find out what the songs were going to be, and from there do nothing that wouldn’t serve the songs. Sometimes we get handcuffed by “bring the demo to the band, then try to play it and then that’ll be the song.”</p> <p>Rebecca Zeller: Also we wanted for everyone to not go in knowing exactly what we’d be doing, like “I’m going to play violin on this one,” or “I’m playing bass.” It was a sense of putting away our….</p> <p>Milo Bonacci: Egos</p> <p>RZ: Egos and pre-defined roles.

Drawing their inspiration from art and philosophy, Fear of Men deliberately juxtaposes iconic museum imagery and lyrical themes of loneliness and fragmentation with buoyant pop melodies.While studying for a Fine Art & History of Art degree, Jessica Weiss (vocals + guitar) was exhibiting some of her home recordings of ambient soundtracks to short films when these recordings caught the attention of Daniel Falvey (guitar). The two began swapping mix tapes and started a friendship based on a shared love of melody and an eclectic mix of artists such as The Chills, Grouper, Neutral Milk Hotel, The Magnetic Fields, and The Byrds, ultimately leading to the start of a more pop-focused project which they called Fear of Men.Starting out, the duo recorded their music on a 4-track and transferred it onto their laptops, which Jess would then use as part of her degree work. They uploaded their songs to bandcamp and immediately caught the attention of UK blogs. Enlisting the help of friends to play drums and bass, Fear of Men approached DIY promoters and immediately began playing live shows.Fear of Men, completed by Michael Miles (drums) and Robyn Edwards (bass), began releasing singles on DIY and independent UK labels and capturing the attention of Pitchfork, NME, Gorilla vs. Bear, Stereogum, The Fader, Drowned in Sound and topping the Hype Machine charts. For a wider introduction into North America, Fear of Men is releasing “Early Fragments” a reverse chronological collection of their previous single releases, many of which were only available in Europe on limited edition 7” and cassette pressings.Fans of Broadcast and Julie Doiron will instantly gravitate toward Jess’ tender vocals and melodies. The songs are beguilingly sweet while the lyrics are often bleakly nihilistic, meaning that you’ll find yourself singing along to these intelligent, well-crafted pop songs while unwittingly sinking deeper into Fear of Men’s world.Press Quotes“Fear of Men’s swoony, sweet dream-pop is both euphoric and miserable, all at once” - Stereogum“A dreamy four-piece band split between London and Brighton” -Pitchfork“Fear of Men are truly one of the most consistent groups on the rise- every new song is like a dive into a leaf pile, and the heaps are piling up impossible to ignore” - The Fader“One of the best new bands of 2012” - Gorilla vs. Bear“At just the slightest of guitar riffs or harmonic woos, the Brighton-sometimes-London fourpiece can evoke the sort of spine tingle that most bands could only bring about after layers and layers of ear-numbing reverb.” - The Line of Best Fit","<p class=""wysiwyg-text-align-justify""><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">Fear of Men, born of an art school project, has turned into one of the most promising bands of 2013.

The band formed in 2002 and has since released five records and toured fifteen countries. The Thermals’ sixth LP and debut for Saddle Creek, Desperate Ground will be released April 16. The album was produced by John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr, Sonic Youth) in Hoboken, NJ. Agnello and The Thermals completed the record and evacuated the studio just hours before Hurricane Sandy ravaged New Jersey, a fate quite fitting when you consider the product. Desperate Ground is a true scrappy and scratchy return-to-form for The Thermals, with all the raw power and unhinged adolescent energy that made their early LP’s so insanely enjoyable. Lyrically, Desperate Ground is a brash and irresponsible ode to human violence, a black celebration of the inevitability of war and death. A dark and yet joyous affair, Desperate Ground tells the (murky) tale of a lone rogue in the night. One man, one path, one sword. An unceasing urge to destroy. A never-ending battle against the forces of nature. A destiny impossible to avoid. The Thermals are Hutch Harris, Kathy Foster and Westin Glass.","<p>The Thermals are a post-pop-punk trio from pre-Portlandia-Portland, Oregon.

Autre Ne Veut rivaled other lovelorn “missteps” such as Marvin Gaye’s Here My Dear and Big Star’s Sister Lovers. If you didn’t hear the connection, you weren’t listening closely enough. Be that as it may, ANV brazenly decided to make it easier for people with his post-canonical return. No longer playing the role of pauper or king, Anxiety is simply his high definition arrival. Born April 20th, 1982 Arthur Ashin is the first of two children and the only son of American ex-patriots living in rural Kenya. He’s struggled with minor bouts of depression throughout his life, but a year of intensive psychoanalysis helped Arthur to realize that anxiety was at the crux of his problems. Anxiety is in some sense Ashin closing a chapter on his adolescence through song-form depictions of his own relationship struggles and ecstasies. There are club bangers on Anxiety, for sure; “Counting” a cybernetic sea shanty tips its hat to Timbaland, and opening track “Play By Play” rolls out like a slowly evolving Top 40 operetta with nods to Dr. Luke and Patti LaBelle in equal measure. But when experienced as a whole, there is an unfolding sense of confession to Anxiety. Like a collection of photographs, each featuring our anti-hero surrounded by lovers, friends, and family and, ultimately, the world, Ashin himself is peripheral to the action. He is always a little too aware of the joke, laughing at the wrong time. The influences on Anxiety range from David Byrne to Lee “Scratch” Perry, Laurie Anderson and Annie Lennox to Katy Perry and Rihanna. But Arthur’s primary influence – and the influence most evident in his music – is of karaoke- the solitary person singing along with their favorite song. In karaoke we get to be someone bigger than who we usually are. When we sing karaoke or when we sing in the shower, we get to be gods; gods with bars of soap, gods with plastic cups in our hands. We’re going to tell iTunes that this a Pop/R&B record, but our gut says it’s so much more. Anxiety is available via the Software Recording Co. February 12th, 2013 in limited vinyl edition as well as CD and digital formats.","<p>“Anxiety in children is originally nothing other than an expression of the fact they are feeling the loss of the person they love” – Sigmund Freud</p> <p>Anxiety is the full-length follow up to Autre Ne Veut’s 2010 self-titled debut, which was for many the definitive post-millennial Failure Pop statement outside of time and style.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/avoxblue","Avoxblue","Boston, MA","","Experimental beats, otherworldly echoes, and thick of deep, dark textures surround Avoxblue, the new solo project of Jimmy Rossi, Jr., creating an ethereal atmosphere which can easily consume the listener. Over the past five years, Cambridge has been recognized as a hotspot for the regeneration of shoegaze – first made popular by bands like My Bloody Valentine in the late 80s/early 90s – with the appearance of sub genres like metalgaze, stargaze, and spacegaze. Rossi’s former project, The December Sound was on the forefront of psychedelic shoegaze movement, epitomizing the “wall-of-sound” that was associated with this genre. However, after going on a hiatus in 2009, Rossi felt inspired to experiment freely with his own music. By fusing the electronic, synthetically hypnotic sounds of new wave with the reverb heavy, lyrically indistinguishable, and distorted features of shoegaze, Rossi is able to create, in his own words, “an electric wall of sound”. The dreamy soundscapes that Avoxblue creates are recreated live, and it is not uncommon to find yourself hypnotized for the entire duration of the set. Recent live performances, like his August 9th show with Memoryhouse and Twin Sister, have been causing a buzz in the live music circuit. His stunning visuals, live multi-tracking, and sense of the audience has been impressing local music critics and national touring acts. With an album scheduled to drop in early February, Avoxblue has been planning tour dates, both locally and nationally.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/blessed-feathers","Blessed Feathers","West Bend, WI","indie, singer-songwriter, folk, acoustic","West Bend is a Southeast Wisconsin town where the Milwaukee River shifts directions, angling to suddenly head West. It’s also the home of Blessed Feathers, a duo that initiated when Donivan Berube’s life similarly altered course. Hailing from Lakeland Florida, FL, Berube was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, teaching himself guitar and recorded songs in his bedroom in an attempt to pursue his passion. The musician eventually left home at 17, disassociating himself from the church and driving 36 hours from the Florida sunshine into a Wisconsin blizzard. Berube found work in a restaurant in West Bend where he met Jacquelyn Beaupre, who is now his partner in both music and life. Blessed Feathers arose from Beaupre’s solo material, which Berube produced while living on a farm in Farmington, WI in 2009. Originally he was only interested in augmenting her songwriting, bolstering the organic, folk-inspired track with additional instrumentation and vocal harmonies, but slowly the duo began constructing songs together, each bringing their own stylistic tendencies to the table. “We didn’t really have a plan set in our minds,” Berube says of the music. “It’s just what happened.” The pair played their first show at a West Bend bookstore in April of 2010 at a meeting of the Fireside Books’ Poetry Club, building a reputation in the surrounding towns. Their stock of songs grew, all captured via a laptop and microphone in their bedroom. In mid-2012, however, Blessed Feathers selected their favorite five tracks to record with producer Kevin McMahon (Real Estate, Titus Andronicus, The Walkmen) at his studio in New Paltz, NY. The songs, which comprise the band’s debut EP, Peaceful Beasts in an Ocean of Weeds, encapsulate Berube and Beaupre’s collective experiences, aiming to capture both their emotional and geographic journeys. “I feel like these songs were birthed in Wisconsin so what we’re recording is how we feel about our home and focused on imagery from our home,” Beaupre says. “Donivan has a few songs from Florida, from before he came up to Wisconsin. But most of the songs are little bits and pieces of our life in Wisconsin. They’re all rooted in locale, all about places we’ve lived. We’re trying to pick out small pieces of our own history and enlighten people with that.” Berube adds, “This EP compiles our five best songs to date. We wanted to put our best foot forward, so to speak.” The pair contributed numerous instruments to the album, including banjo, flute, vibraphone and various percussion. But, ultimately, McMahon and the band focused on maintain the earthy, homespun sound that Blessed Feathers has cultivated over the past few years. The EP resonates with a woodsy vibe, urging the listener into an intimate, skillfully crafted sonic space—aided in many ways by McMahon’s recording style. “He has little tricks up his sleeve,” Beaupre notes. “Because we recorded it in a barn he took our vocals and recorded them through a microphone and then played them into the silo of the barn and record the natural echoes. That became the album recording. It’s a wonderful sound and we loved that idea. Things like that have helped shape the EP.” Berube and Beaupre still work in the same restaurant where they first met, spending their time, as Berube says, “cooking dinner for strangers.” They share a 10-year-old cell phone and can only access the Internet from their local library. They are interested in capturing all their experiences, not just the ones they’ve found in West Bend. Their music is optimistic, gleaming with a sense of appreciation for the things around them and the things within them. The pair likes to say that Beaupre plays everything and Berube plays everything else, but a better way to put it is that together they play everything.","<p>West Bend is a Southeast Wisconsin town where the Milwaukee River shifts directions, angling to suddenly head West.

Taking a no-holds-barred attitude to music creation Flume takes inspiration from a wide variety of sources and scenes distilling his sound into a melodic bass heavy style of his own. International press has come from tastemaking sources including XLR8R (USA – 8.6/10 review), Lodown Magazine (UK – 8/10 review) & Electronic Beats (Germany). In Australia, Flume has received strong support from leading youth broadcaster Triple J (morning Host Zan Rowe naming ‘Sleepless’ as her “Catch of The Day”) and community radio nationally, with high rotation on RRR, PBS, RTR, FBi and 2ser. Flume is getting significant buzz online with ‘Sleepless’ amassing 500,000+ plays on YouTube, and 120,000+ on Soundcloud and his facebook page has 23,000+ fans in less than a year of being online. Sleepless was soft released in August 2011 and has been #1 on the iTunes Australia Electronic Chart for several weeks and in the top 10 for several months. Flume has also featured on a vinyl co-release with Anna Lunoe and has released remixes for Hermitude, Junior Boys, Onra, The Aston Shuffle and Ta-ku. Flume’s live shows have now come into full effect after 2 sold out national headline tours of 300-500 capacity rooms, Sydney and Melbourne supports for the xx and Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (forthcoming) and festival bookings for Splendour in the Grass, a sold-out show at Vivid LIVE at the Sydney Opera House where he headlined alongside Jacques Renault & Isolee, and has been confirmed for the full national run for Parklife, as well as Harbourlife, Foreshore and several more New Years period festivals in Australia and New Zealand. He’s also been the main support for shows by Hermitude, Oscar + Martin, Chet Faker and New Navy. Internationally Flume has been confirmed to perform at CMJ in New York in October 2012 and been signed for UK and European booking by Elastic Artists (Flying Lotus, Major Lazer) with plans for both a European and North American tour in 2013. Flume’s debut self-titled album will be out on 12 November 2012 released worldwide by Future Classic (Flight Facilities, New Navy). It will be preceded by a vinyl/digital release of Sleepless on 24 September with remixes by Shlohmo (USA) and Midland (UK) and a video clip.

Their idiosyncratic sound, typified by chiming pianos, distorted synths and pounding kick drums, deftly explores the musical space between euphoric warehouse rave and melancholic, emotive pop. Glitched, machine-like cries and haunted, pure harmonic vocals interplay & counterbalance one another, creating a fascinating tension and atmosphere within the tracks. Be it their music, or their artistic videos, striking artwork or direct website, all of which they create and control themselves, this juxtaposition of the inhuman and the soulful, of the aggressive and the beautiful, works to underpin everything NO CEREMONY/// do. Originating in August 2011, the band announced their arrival onto the musical landscape in style, with their widely-lauded track ‘HURTLOVE’ setting blogs alight within 24 hours of release. Since then, they have shown no intention of slowing down, and over the last year have released six tracks to their ever-growing fanbase, each available as a free digital download, and two 10” vinyls on their own label, NOC///. Alongside this, they have collaborated on original music with the likes of Joey Santiago (PIXIES), Mike Joyce (The Smiths) and Stay+, remixed numerous well known and up and coming artists including Alt-J, The Temper Trap and Patrick Wolf, and created mixtapes for legendary electronic music DJ Mary Anne Hobbs and popular French music site HORS D’OEVRES. From the outset, the trio chose to shun traditional methods of self-promotion, instead choosing to keep the personas behind the music away from the limelight. They still do not appear on social media sites, have had no press shots taken and no personal biography written. Rather than simply being obfuscating, this decision was a way for them to focus all their efforts on creating music without the distraction of social media publication or autobiographical self-promotion. As the band themselves comment – ‘It’s not about being secretive or mysterious and more of a reluctance to engage. We want to engage through our music – that’s where we put our message and emotion.’ Subsequently, they have received a vast amount of critical acclaim purely for their consistent output of innovative, forward-thinking electronica, both at home and abroad. Hailed as Zane Lowe’s (BBC Radio 1) Next Big Hype, and featuring as one of The Independent’s Most Blogged Artists, NO CEREMONY/// have received Hype Machine Top 10 rankings twice, including a prolonged stay in the number 1 position for most recent release ‘FEELSOLOW’. They have also been featured on Pitchfork, playlisted on XFM (UK), Amazing Radio (UK), NRK (Norway) and Flux FM (Germany), and have appeared twice as Lauren Laverne’s (BBC 6 Music) MPFree of the Day. Taking their music into the live arena has also proved fruitful. Since their first gig in May 2012; a sold out hometown show with Mercury Award Winning Alt-J; they have also shared stages with SBTRKT, Zola Jesus, Willy Moon, Peace and Niki & The Dove. Soon after their first performance, and before they had even had a chance to play their own headline show, they had been invited to both the BBC’s prestigious Maida Vale Studios and the XFM Evening Show studios to record two captivating live radio session performances. All of the shows they have played in the UK have sold out, and they have toured in France, Germany, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, at such high profile events as Pukkelpop, MIDI, Swn, Dockville and Reeperbahn Festivals. In a glowing review of their performance at MIDI festival this summer, iconic French publication Les Inrocks poetically described NO CEREMONY/// as “A Volcano under the Ice”. This succinctly summarizes both the intensity and self-control the band have been acclaimed for, and the torrid emotion that lurks just below, frequently seeping through the mechanical surface of their music. Above all, it marks the genesis of a band for who these notable plaudits are just the beginning. They have recently finished recording their debut album, which is to be released in the early part of 2013. Whilst the achievements of this formative year are undoubtedly impressive, their inventive music, expanding admirers, and the method by which they connect the two, look set to ensure the future is even more exciting for NO CEREMONY///.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/linear-downfall","Linear Downfall","Nashville, TN","","From Facebook:Are you happy, sad, laughing, crying, smiling, frightened, or all of the above at the same time? Nashville-based experimental/psychedelic rock band LINEAR DOWNFALL explores musical dimensions that most bands dare cross into. Band members Charlee Cook (vocals, bass, synth), Chance Cook (guitar, vocals), Will Hicks (drums, keys) ,and Dom Marcoaldi (guitar, etc) are all multi-instrumentalists and share a passion for creativity. Their debut album, Daydreaming at Night (released October 2009), introduced listeners to music that inspired them to open their mind to a new sound. gloomillume (released December 2010) is a concept album that begins on earth in the midst of the apocalypse and ends on a beautiful planet called gloomillume. This fifteen-song combustion of originality fuses multiple musical styles. The “gloom” is present in songs like Just a # (a glitchy, bass-driven, view of the inside of a mental hospital), a Wave of (an ambient, tranquil, emotional experience), and Pick.Pull.Claw (a psychedelic, acidic, composition). The transition from dark to light takes place during Projector Eyes (chaos into 60s sunshine pop). The “illume” half of the album produces songs like Intergalactic Festivity (A disco space party hopping genres), and Rainbow Don’t Go (electronic pop). Another facet of LINEAR DOWNFALL often experienced is their outward expression of their music through a dynamic theatrical stage show. Fans are drawn into the adventure and encouraged to participate, releasing their own interpretation of the music and free-flowing expression. In 2012, Linear Downfall had a very crazy and ambitious year. They added a new member, Dom, on guitar to help fill out their layered sound, went and recorded at Wayne Coyne’s (Flaming Lips’ frontman) house, played two songs “21st Century Schizoid Man” (a King Crimson cover) and the Flaming Lips/Lightning Bolt Collaboration “I’m Working at NASA on Acid” live on the O Music Awards on stage with the Flaming Lips, was a part of the remake of King Crimson’s 1969 debut album “In the Court of the Crimson King” featuring the Flaming Lips, Stardeath and White Dwarfs, New Fumes, and Space Face with Linear Downfall on “21st Century Schizoid Man” and collaborating with the all of the bands on the song “Epitaph”,and supported the album with the “Exploding the Moon a Million Times” tour with Stardeath and White Dwarfs, New Fumes, and Space Face. They also completed their third album entitled “Fragmental Hippocampus” which is their most experimental and personal album to date. Linear Downfall has big plans for the future including some interesting albums and lots of touring.","<p>From <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lineardownfall/info"">Facebook</a>:<br><br><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">Are you happy, sad, laughing, crying, smiling, frightened, or all of the above at the same time?

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/fitz-and-the-tantrums","Fitz and the Tantrums","Los Angeles, CA","indie, pop, soul","In just a year or so, soulsters Fitz & the Tantrums went from the living room to the main stage. The recipe for meteoric success? Six killer musicians, five dapper suits, irresistible songs, some serendipity and one vintage organ. Since their first show at Hollywood’s Hotel Café in December 2008, Fitz and co. have toured with Maroon 5, played to thousands at Colorado’s world famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre, shared the stage New Year’s Eve with Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, and performed on KCRW’s esteemed show, Morning Becomes Eclectic. All this on the strength of their stellar five-song EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1. For some bands, it takes a lifetime to build this success, but few performers deliver an unrestrained blast of soul-clapping, get-down-on-the-floor, moneymaker shakers like Fitz and the Tantrums. Now post-release of their debut full length, Pickin’ Up the Pieces, which has since earned them a 3 ½ star album review in ROLLING STONE, the troupe is poised to get down in dancehalls across the universe. It all began when… [cue flashback sounds] “I got a call from my ex-girlfriend,” Fitz explains, “And she said, ‘My neighbor is moving out in a hurry and has to sell everything. And, he has this organ…” Fitz, the Svengali frontman of the crew, describes the find like the discovery of a compass, or that treasure map in Goonies, which undoubtedly leads to adventure. Not one to say no, Fitz called some piano movers, cashed in some favors, and seven hours later, the organ went from the curb to his living room. That night, Fitz stationed himself in front of that vintage instrument and wrote a blue-eyed soul anthem, “Breaking the Chains of Love.” “Sometimes, the Music Gods just give it to you,” Fitz says. The overflow of inspiration startled Fitz. He’d spent years in L.A.’s music industry, writing music and working in a studio with Beck producer, Mickey Petralia. But at those 88 keys, just seven hours after that organ dropped into his life, Fitz had finally found his voice. “I’ve always been a singer,” Fitz says, “but with so much music, I felt that I was trying to push a square peg through a round hole. I was being not true to myself, and it never felt right until I wrote that song, and I sang like that. I thought, this feels so real, so natural.” Fitz shared his vision with long-time friend and saxophonist, James King, who immediately connected with the sound. While the electric guitar drives rock, the saxophone takes center stage in soul, and that’s the way Fitz likes it. “We wanted to find a new vocabulary for the genre, I wanted to make a record without any guitars. Could we make a huge sound with out any guitars?” A huge sound takes a huge studio—Motown had Studio A in Detroit, Philadelphia International had Sigma Studios, Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound was created in Hollywood’s legendary Gold Star Studios— but when it came time to capture the feeling and the soul of soul, Fitz knew of the perfect studio: his home. There in the living room, he recorded Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, a burst of effervescent swingers and floor-stompers, infused with the energy of long forgotten songs. The infectious, rolling rhythms of “Breaking the Chains of Love,” immediately turns your head and actually get cemented in your brain, like a good pop song should. The sound is familiar, but distinct. That’s what grabbed the attention of Maroon 5’s Adam Levine. Levine was getting a tattoo in New York when the tattoo artist told him he had to hear this new band he had discovered. After that one encounter, Levine personally invited Fitz and the Tantrums to join their tour. Like the EP, Fitz recorded the full-length debut back at home, to bottle the lightning that struck in those first jam sessions. He now delves into more acerbic lyrical territory, going on the offensive against gold diggers on the exceptionally funky “MoneyGrabber,” and even gets political on the piano-banging, handclap-driven call to action, “Dear Mr. President.” “L.O.V.” is a jaunt through pop music history embarking with a groovy organ intro, meandering through juicy big band breakdowns and Fitz’s svelte croons, then carrying us away with flute outro. It’s a funk-filled plea to give love a chance. These powerful songs take the band’s energy up a notch, but like their energized performances, they never loose control. Those blistering performances are now well-chronicled for adequate ubiquity, Last Call With Carson Daly nailing the money shot for “MoneyGrabber” at the band’s sold out show in November at LA’s El Rey Theatre featuring a sea of a thousand pogoing fans and a handful of F.A.T.T. gems rocked along with blue-eyed soul vet, Daryl Hall on the band’s spot on Live From Daryl’s House. Lest we forget, omnipresent the T-Mobile HTC ad that actually namechecks the band that, for the past several months, is impossible not to see if you’re watching even an hour’s worth of television. Oh, and there are the hot spots on Criminal Minds, Desperate Housewives and a great many more, not to mention a ton of success at radio for the aforementioned runaway “MoneyGrabber,” all with the promise of more to come. In their sound and on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are nothing but professionals, and never less than classy. Enter the Tantrums, Fitz’s airtight ensemble keeping it real like it’s1969. Funky drummer John Wicks is a Motown B-side aficionado and prolific session player, Jeremy Ruzumna manned the keyboards for Macy Gray, while King and bassist Ethan Phillips backed De La Soul (Phillips has since been replaced by Joseph Karnes). Then there’s Noelle Scaggs, the powerful voice behind Fitz’s croons. Make no mistake, Scaggs is not just there for “doo-wops” and handclaps. She shimmies and flirts, she stokes the crowd and simmers them down, and she has no qualms about keeping Fitz in check. “She is not just a backup singer,” Fitz says, “We have repartee. Onstage, we’re Ike and Tina.” There, on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are not just a band, they’re an explosion. Scaggs high steps it to the tight-as-hell rhythm section, while Fitz, cooler than cobalt, croons like the aforementioned Mr. Hall for a new generation. It’s obvious that this is no tryst for the band, this is a full-blown, head-over-heels love affair.

But make no mistake: When it comes right down to it, the Wheel as a collective unit plays second fiddle to no one.

The band’s name may be a joke (Benson is as known for his sense of humor as for his mellifluous voice and imposing stature), but there’s no fooling around when it comes to the serious musicianship on display as the Wheel careens all over the highways and byways of American music.","<p>Yes, Asleep at the Wheel makes great music when paired with superstars.

He is one of the most prominent rappers in underground hip-hop, and is critically acclaimed frequently, despite not being incredibly commercially successful. His name is Arabic, meaning ‘the seeker’ or ‘student of truth and knowledge’. His parents were both college professors: his mother an English professor, his father a sociology professor. As a youth, he was drawn to Afrocentric rappers, such as De La Soul(LA LE LU) and other members of the Native Tongues Posse and soon began recording with producer Hi-Tek and rapper Mos Def who he met at central park, and later attended New York University with. With Mos Def (together the pair were known as Black Star), Kweli achieved some mainstream success with the eponymously titled album Black Star. (1998) While Mos Def went on to a solo career, Kweli released the Hi Tek-produced Reflection Eternal in 2000, which sold better than most alternative hip hop albums at the time. He has since released a critically acclaimed solo debut, Quality, in 2002. In 2004, Kweli released his second solo album, The Beautiful Struggle, which features production more akin to commercial rap, while Kweli’s lyrical content retains its powerful social-political content. His third solo album Ear Drum was released on August 21st, 2007 on Warner Bros./Blacksmith Music. Kweli has created his own record label, Blacksmith Records and has recently signed acclaimed female rapper Jean Grae, with rumors continuing to grow that underground veteran MF DOOM is the next artist to be picked up. He left Geffen Records and has signed with the Warner Music Group. He has since broken through slightly more towards the mainstream, thanks in large part to several appearance on the comedy show Chappelle’s Show, both solo and with long-time collaborator Mos Def, this is due to a friendship between the host and creator of the show, comedian Dave Chappelle and the rapper. He also had a guest spot on friend and frequent collaborator Kanye West‘s widely succesful debut album The College Dropout on the track ""Get ’Em High"". West has also produced some of Kweli’s songs, including his biggest commerical hit ""Get By"". He also can be seen in a commercial for the NCAA’s Big Ten Conference, rapping about the league’s basketball teams. Recently, he provided the voice for the main character, Trane, in the video game Marc Ecko’s Getting Up, released in 2006.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/ben-kweller","Ben Kweller","Greenville, TX (born in San Fran, live in Austin)","indie, singer-songwriter, indie rock","Ben Kweller was born in San Francisco, CA in 1981. In 1982 his family relocated to Emory, TX where his father Howard Kweller became the town’s first doctor. In 1986, The Kwellers moved to a much larger city, Greenville, TX. Ben was exposed to music at a very early age. Howard taught Ben how to play the drums when he was 7 years old. For the next year, the father and son would jam together almost every night after Howard got home from work. With Howard singing and playing guitar and Ben keeping the beat, the duo would play songs by The Beatles, The Hollies, Jimi Hendrix, and other artists of the 1960s. Howard is also a long-time friend of Nils Lofgren, the two went to high school together. When Ben turned 8, someone showed him how to play ""Heart And Soul"" on the piano. The youngster immediately began to create his own songs using the same chords. By the time he was 9 he had a dozen original compositions under his belt and entered a songwriting contest sponsored by Billboard magazine. Kweller won honorable mention. In 1993 Kweller became friends with another young local musician, drummer John Kent, and the two formed the band Radish with bassist Ryan Green. The trio played locally in and around Greenville, Texas and recorded two independent releases, ’’Hello’’ (1994) and ’’Dizzy’’ (1995), with Martin Baird at Verge Music Works recording studio in Dallas, Texas. Around the time of ’’Dizzy’s’’ release, Ryan Green decided to leave the band and focus his attention on school. Lorin Hamilton filled in for a few months until Bryan Bradford AKA Bryan Blur joined on for most of the band’s career. Ben sent a copy of ’’Dizzy’’ to Nils Lofgren. Nils was impressed with Radish and recommended them to Roger Greenawalt who was producing Lofgren’s album at the time, ‘’Damaged Goods’‘. Greenawalt took Radish into a studio where they recorded a demo tape which was subsequently shopped around to record labels nationwide, After an unexpected bidding war, Radish eventually signed to Mercury to release the album Restraining Bolt. Radish made appearances on ’’The Weird Al Show’’, ‘’Late Night with Conan O’Brien"" and ‘’Late Show with David Letterman’‘, but despite the much-hyped signing, the band failed to strike big success. Radish earned a large cult following in the United Kingdom with their top 40 hit ""Little Pink Stars"". The band toured several times in Europe including opening slots for Faith No More and Main Stage at Reading Festival ’97. Radish released two singles. In 1998 Radish became a quartet featuring Joe Butcher (Polyphonic Spree, Ufofu) on lead guitar and Debbie Williams on bass. Radish went to Muscle Shoals Studio in Alabama to record the follow-up to ’’Restraining Bolt’’, provisionally titled ‘’Discount Fireworks’‘. The band recorded with record producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, The Lemonheads). While mixing ’’Discount Fireworks’’ in NYC, Kweller and Kent met bassist Josh Lattanzi who would become Radish’s 5th and final bass player. As a result of Polygram’s merger with Universal Music Group, the 18-song album was never released and Radish soon secured a release from their contract with Mercury Records. At age 19, Ben Kweller moved to New York with his girlfriend Liz Smith, where he began his solo career. He played acoustic shows and self-released four EP’s, comprising some of the unreleased Radish ‘’Discount Fireworks’’ recordings and other songs recorded in his apartment on a laptop computer. It was one of these EPs, ‘’Freak Out, It’s Ben Kweller’’, that caught the attention of Evan Dando of The Lemonheads, and Dando invited Kweller out on tour with him, playing across America and Europe. Jeff Tweedy, Juliana Hatfield and Guster also began to notice Kweller and took him on tour with them In 2001 Ben Kweller became ATO Records’s first worldwide signing and released a 5-track EP entitled ‘’EP Phone Home’‘. In March 2002, ’’Sha Sha’’, Kweller’s first solo studio Album was released. ‘’Sha Sha’’ included the very radio-friendly and popular single ""Wasted & Ready"". The album featured John Kent on drums, Josh Lattanzi on bass, and showcased a wide variety of sound from Quirky Pop music to Folk to Punk. The album grew in popularity with a grassroots effort based on his website and a promotion group called teamBK, which promoted via word-of-mouth advertising. To support the release of the album and EP, he put together a live band, initially comprising Lattanzi on bass, Fred Eltringham on drums, and Mike Stroud on guitar and keyboards. Towards the end of the ‘’Sha Sha’’ album cycle, the four-piece performed on PBS’s Austin City Limits In 2003, Kweller toured Australia with Ben Folds and Ben Lee as The Bens. The trio produced an eponymous four-song EP, with each member taking lead vocals on one song, and a final song in which they all contributed vocals. In an interview on October 14 2006 Ben hinted that The Bens may do another album. Later in 2003, Kweller provided lead vocals on the song ""I Hope Tomorrow is Like Today"" from Guster’s album ‘’Keep It Together’‘. Kweller and Guster co-wrote the song after a late night jam at Gusters’ Brooklyn studio. The song is prominently featured in the movie The Wedding Crashers. ‘’On My Way’’ (2004), Kweller’s second album, went in a new direction. The album, produced by Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams, Kings of Leon), was recorded ‘live’ – there were limited overdubs and no use of headphones. After the release of On My Way, Kweller embarked on more touring, playing to his largest audiences ever, including a US tour co-headlining with Death Cab for Cutie. By this point, the lineup of his live band had changed to include John Kent on drums and Jason Roberts on guitar and keyboards, after Mike Stroud left to concentrate on his own band Ratatat and Fred Eltringham left to play drums in The Wallflowers. In 2006 he recorded his third album, ‘’Ben Kweller’’ with record producer, Gil Norton. Unlike the previous studio albums, Kweller played all the instruments on this record himself. Kweller continued to tour to support his self-titled album, and expanded his band into a five piece, which grew to include Dan Horne on bass, Mark Stepro on drums, Jay Barclay on guitar and organ, and Jason Roberts on lead guitar. Kweller continued to play guitar and piano on this tour, but it also gave him the opportunity to just sing on certain songs. His tie-in ""Trio on the Train Track Tour"" included a new live band comprising Chris Morrissey on bass and Mark Stepro on drums. During the Australian leg of the tour, the band was composed of Jay Barclay on guitar, Dan Horne on bass and Mark Stepro continuing on drums. As part of his 2006 tour, Kweller played the Austin City Limits Music Festival, where he was plagued by a severe nosebleed for the entirety of his set. After covering his guitar in blood, he attempted to stop the flow by inserting a travel-size tampon thrown onto the stage by a fan, which expanded painfully during a performance of ""This Is War."" After attempting to play ""Falling"" at the piano, which also became covered in blood, Kweller was forced to end the set early. In the Spring of 2007, Kweller co-headlined with his label-mates Gomez. He continued through the summer with his own string of headlining dates which eventually ended at another appearance at ACL fest. This time no bloody nose, however, commemorative T-shirts were sold at the merch booth with fake blood stains that said ""ACL 2007: The return of Ben Kweller"". Immediately following his performance at ACL, Kweller began recording his fourth full-length LP, ‘’Changing Horses’’ in Austin, Texas on September 21, 2007. The album features the trio on the train tracks, and Pedal Steel/Dobro player Kitt Kitterman. In 2008, Kweller re-signed with ATO Records who will be releasing ‘’Changing Horses’’ in early 2009. Listen at Last.fmThe fact that Ben Kweller didn't quite break out as the teen grunge god that his early buzz seemed to peg him as has only served him well in the long run. In the mid-'90s, when Kweller was only 15, the New Yorker dedicated a feature story to him and his Dallas-area rock band, Radish, that suggested they might very well be the next Nirvana. It didn't happen. But after Radish fell short of expectations, Kweller emerged as a prodiciously talented singer-songwriter whose razor-sharp pop instincts made all that early hype actually seem conservative. In 2002, Kweller moved from Texas to New York and launged his solo career with the promising Freak Out…It's Ben Kweller, followed by 2002's even better Sha Sha, a hodgepodge of pop from piano to pop that found a music genius showing the true bredth of his abilities to the world for the first time. His third album, 2004's On My Way, was his finest effort to date, boasting both a tighter focus and, impossibly, even catchier songs. Kweller, a proud veteran of both the Austin City Limits TV show and the ACL Festival, will no doubt have plenty of new songs to share at Zilker Park this year, as September happeens to be the target release month for his next record, simply titled Ben Kweller. In addition to recording his own album, Kweller also recently traveled to France to produce a record by another ACL Festival '06 performer, Pierre Guimard; that record hists stores in September, too.","<p>Ben Kweller was born in San Francisco, CA in 1981.

After covering his guitar in blood, he attempted to stop the flow by inserting a travel-size tampon thrown onto the stage by a fan, which expanded painfully during a performance of ""This Is War."" After attempting to play ""Falling"" at the piano, which also became covered in blood, Kweller was forced to end the set early. In the Spring of 2007, Kweller co-headlined with his label-mates <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Gomez"" class=""bbcode_artist"">Gomez</a>. He continued through the summer with his own string of headlining dates which eventually ended at another appearance at <span class=""caps"">ACL</span> fest. This time no bloody nose, however, commemorative T-shirts were sold at the merch booth with fake blood stains that said ""<span class=""caps"">ACL</span> 2007: The return of Ben Kweller"". Immediately following his performance at <span class=""caps"">ACL</span>, Kweller began recording his fourth full-length LP, ‘’Changing Horses’’ in Austin, Texas on September 21, 2007. The album features the trio on the train tracks, and Pedal Steel/Dobro player Kitt Kitterman. In 2008, Kweller re-signed with <a href=""http://www.last.fm/label/ATO+Records/"" class=""bbcode_label""><span class=""caps"">ATO</span> Records</a> who will be releasing ‘’Changing Horses’’ in early 2009. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Kweller"" target=""_blank"">Listen at Last.fm</a><br />The fact that Ben Kweller didn't quite break out as the teen grunge god that his early buzz seemed to peg him as has only served him well in the long run. In the mid-'90s, when Kweller was only 15, the New Yorker dedicated a feature story to him and his Dallas-area rock band, Radish, that suggested they might very well be the next Nirvana. It didn't happen. But after Radish fell short of expectations, Kweller emerged as a prodiciously talented singer-songwriter whose razor-sharp pop instincts made all that early hype actually seem conservative. In 2002, Kweller moved from Texas to New York and launged his solo career with the promising Freak Out…It's Ben Kweller, followed by 2002's even better Sha Sha, a hodgepodge of pop from piano to pop that found a music genius showing the true bredth of his abilities to the world for the first time. His third album, 2004's On My Way, was his finest effort to date, boasting both a tighter focus and, impossibly, even catchier songs. Kweller, a proud veteran of both the Austin City Limits TV show and the <span class=""caps"">ACL</span> Festival, will no doubt have plenty of new songs to share at Zilker Park this year, as September happeens to be the target release month for his next record, simply titled Ben Kweller. In addition to recording his own album, Kweller also recently traveled to France to produce a record by another <span class=""caps"">ACL</span> Festival '06 performer, Pierre Guimard; that record hists stores in September, too.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7759842/499bfadb15773a0279eba46903eba0cf_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/-CRPLtpTJUI?enablejsapi=1&version=3"
"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-trishas-","The Trishas","Austin, TX","","The four principal members of Austin’s The Trishas would have you believe that they’re not blood related. But a DNA test might be in order. True, their individual bios may support their claims of having all had separate lives before meeting each other; but to hear them sing together, you’d swear they were harmonizing from the womb. Then again, sometimes luck and fate sing in perfect harmony, too, and uncontested magic just happens — just as it did the very first time Jamie Wilson, Kelley Mickwee, Liz Foster and Savannah Welch ever shared a stage together. It was ostensibly supposed to be a one-off gig — two songs as part of a tribute to Savannah’s father, famed songwriter Kevin Welch, at the 2009 MusicFest in Steamboat Springs, Colo. But midway through their first practice, it became clear to all in the room that they were on to something good. Goosebumps don’t lie. “I remember we were at Kevin’s house, working up one of his songs — I think it was ‘Satan’s Paradise’ — when I first heard it,” Wilson recalls. “We were going over the song, figuring out our parts and everything, and we tried it and didn’t hit it, tried it again and didn’t hit it … until one time, finally, we actually got it, and I thought, ‘Cool!’ And then we worked up the whole song, and all of us were like, ‘You know, this is actually pretty good. We’re actually going to be pretty good — if we can pull this off.’” By all accounts, they did indeed pull off “Satan’s Paradise” at the Welch tribute. But it was their gorgeous way with “Till I’m Too Old to Die Young” that really killed — and still does, on the rare occasions when they still perform it. “We only do it now at a certain kind of special gigs, if the mood feels right,” explains Savannah. Fortunately, they captured it perfectly in the studio for their self-released debut, They Call Us The Trishas. The five-song “mini album” (don’t call it an EP!) is the perfect calling card for the Trishas, distilling the essence of their full live show into a svelte 20 minutes that also proves they can write songs every bit as striking as their voices, as shown by the sterling originals “Give It Away,” “Rise Above” and “So Blue.” They Call Us The Trishas was released to warm reviews and enthusiastic fan reaction in August 2010, after the group had already chased their successful MusicFest debut with nearly two solid years’ worth of buzz- and confidence-building shows. Most of those were in and around their home base of Austin (the self-styled “Live Music Capital of the World”), but there were also strategic forays throughout the rest of Texas and points beyond. It wasn’t long before they began nabbing plumb opening-act gigs with the likes of Dwight Yoakam, Raul Malo, Rodney Crowell, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Todd Snider, as well as studio work singing on two of 2010’s most acclaimed Americana releases, Kevin Welch’s A Patch of Blue Sky and Ray Wylie Hubbard’s A. Enlightenment, B. Endarkenment (Hint: There Is No C). Hubbard also secured them a spot onstage singing backup for Joe Walsh at his 2011 Grit ’N Groove Festival in the Texas Hill Country. As potent as they all are as a unit, it’s the combo plate of unique styles and personalities each Trisha brings to the table that makes the group truly, well, sing. “We all have different strengths,” says Liz, “and because of that we’ve been able to educate each other in a lot of different things. I think that’s what’s really connected us more and made us stronger, being able to feed off each other.” To wit: Liz, with a background in Motown revues, stands out with her rafter-raising, gospel-mama boom of a voice and assertive harp. “Musically, Liz brings the Joe Cocker to the group — she’s the wailer,” says Jamie, who in turn leans more to the country/folk side of the fence and is the group’s primary guitarist. “Jamie’s our rock, because she’s the one who has been playing the longest and is the best and the strongest at it,” says Kelley. “Like, we can’t do a gig without her.” Kelley, born in Birmingham and raised in Memphis, brings a heaping helping of bluesy, southern soul to the mix — along with what Jamie calls “a very strong right hand” on mandolin that keeps the band in rhythmic step sans a bass player. And Savannah? “I bring the learning curve,” she offers. “I’m the rookie on deck.” The others share her laugh, but note that she also brings a certain je nais ce quoi “chill factor.” “I don’t know how to describe it, but Savannah’s got a really, really strong voice that has the most delicate little break in it,” observes Jamie. “There’s not really a classification for it, but it’s like the Patty Griffin thing, where there’s just a lot of movement.” Jamie, a native of Sealy, Texas, cut her teeth playing in the alt-country band The Gougers, which recorded four albums over the course of seven years before she struck out on her own with a solo EP, 2008’s Dirty Blonde Hair. San Antonio-born Liz started performing in her teens, singing in various rock and soul cover bands before finding her own artistic voice in Liz and Lincoln, a promising but short-lived duo project with her ex, songwriter Lincoln Durham. Meanwhile, Kelley spent five years touring in a rootsy Americana duo, Jed and Kelley, with her ex, a stint that produced two albums. Savannah was born and raised in Nashville but spent her early adulthood marinating amongst the punks and rockers of Austin’s music scene. She sang backup in her brother Dustin’s rock band and dabbled in songwriting, but spent most of her time pursuing a career in film acting. For now, though, Hollywood will just have to wait, because outside of immediate family — most notably, Jamie’s baby daughter, Joanie (already a road veteran) — The Trishas’ priority No. 1 is working toward the completion of their next album. In 2010, they were signed to a group publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music in Nashville, and they’ve been diligently writing, stockpiling and rehearsing new songs while also fortifying and expanding their grassroots audience by touring more and more outside of Texas. And should the right record deal present itself along the way, well, they’ll weigh their options with savvy, road-hardened Trisha street smarts. “We’re just trying really hard to not have to change anything about ourselves,” Kelley explains. “It’s real hard, but it can be done that way.” “What matters is being able to respect the music that you make 20 years from now,” concludes Jamie, the others nodding in perfect Trisha harmony. “It’s more of a career thing than a go-be-a-star thing.”","<p>The four principal members of Austin’s The Trishas would have you believe that they’re not blood related.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/free-energy","Free Energy","Philadelphia, PA","indie, alternative, indie rock","There are certain bands that demand to be listened in a certain way: Pink Floyd might require a bong & lazer light show; Led Zeppelin benefits from giant, wood-paneled speakers, and FREE ENERGY—a band responsible for having crafted some of the finest guitar-filled power pop this side of Weezer or Cheap Trick—should be played on a cassette deck in a Camaro screaming down the highway; stereo cranked, feather roach clip dangling from the rearview. “Being from the Midwest definitely informed our aesthetic,” says Free Energy vocalist Paul Sprangers. “Growing up in a small town with radio and MTV—then later discovering indie rock and punk rock—really shaped the kind of music we make now. So, I had the same kind of unabashed love for Phil Collins as I did for Pavement—I don’t think I ever grew out of that. It probably shows.” The story of FREE ENERGY, however, doesn’t begin in the backseat of a muscle car, rather St. Paul, Minnesota, where Sprangers and guitarist Scott Wells—both members of the late, great Hockey Night—were signed to NYC powerhouse DFA records based on their homemade demos. After signing and spending a year writing and demoing they moved to NYC to record with James Murphy. As the record neared completion, Sprangers and Wells moved to Philly, brought in their Minnesota friends to fill out the band, and toured relentlessly behind the release of 2010’s Stuck on Nothing. While it might have seemed an odd fit for a power-riffing pop rock act to put out a record on a West Village disco label, the euphoric vibe of Free Energy—embodied in tracks like “Free Energy” and “Bang Pop”—was actually a perfect compliment to the roster of artistically different but equally accomplished bands, such as Black Dice, Yacht, The Rapture, and LCD Soundsystem. The record spawned nearly two years of solid touring and a pile of accolades, including a Best New Music nod from Pitchfork and Rolling Stone’s assessment that the band “totally fucking rules.” At a time when a lot of indie rock is mired in gloom or coated with layers of reverb, FREE ENERGY is interested in sounding like Thin Lizzy or Fleetwood Mac: old-school juggernauts that made clear, well-crafted hook-laden singalongs; songs about love, truth, and the journey within. It’s a time-tested formula, but clearly one that can still sound fresh in the right hands. “For some reason, DFA was the only label that really understood us,” says Sprangers, “They got what we were trying to do, and could hear potential in our demos. We learned so much from their philosophy, and continue to apply it to this day—it was a true education. So, after having done a record with James and DFA—which was a dream come true—it felt like a good time to push ourselves further, which turned out to be making and releasing a record ourselves.” As the band began work on album number two they flirted with a couple different producers. They cut an unreleased track with Jeff Glixman (the producer responsible for Kansas’ classic rock staple, “Dust in the Wind”) before doing a trial run with John Agnello. Agnello’s work with the likes of Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and The Hold Steady made him a good fit for the band, but it was his formative work in the 80’s with the likes of Cyndi Lauper, Hooters, and Bruce Springsteen that sealed the deal. “He really produced,” says Wells. “He came to band practices in Philly. He helped us shape the songs and get the sounds that we needed. He helped us get more clean, digital drum sounds like The Outfield used, which was a priority for us. We wanted to make the biggest, brightest rock songs we could. ” The resulting album is Love Sign, to be released on the band’s new imprint “Free Energy Records” in January of 2013. Much like it’s predecessor, the new record flirts with hysteria-inducing pop songwriting and classic rock production. Tracks like “Electric Fever,” “Hey Tonight” and “Girls Want Rock” demonstrate the band doing what they love—condensing handclaps, harmonies, fist-pumping choruses, and lazer guided guitar leads in such a way that the songs always feel vaguely familiar. These are songs that demand to be blasted in a car as one sings along at the top of one’s lungs. These are songs crafted by young men who clearly have an understanding of pop music’s DNA; the way a good melody can be more catchy than the common cold. Given their go-for-broke vibe, It makes sense that the band keeps a framed photo of Van Halen in their practice space. Ultimately, Free Energy occupy their own interesting niche. Are they an indie rock band? A classic rock band? A power pop band? Even the band isn’t sure (“I wish someone would tell us what we are,” says Sprangers, “because we’ve been described as everything!”), but in the end it doesn’t matter. The tracks on Love Sign flirt with the great themes of lasting rock music—the search for truth, falling in and out of love, and the quest for happiness—without ever sounding like retreads of a bygone era. Love Sign proves that there will always be ways to reconfigure the rock and roll archetypes into something fresh and —for lack of a better word—rocking. “When I think of great songs by Peter Gabriel, or Tom Petty, I hear the them almost like hymns. They speak to something greater than ourselves. Even the simplest rock music—songs about partying and girls—can be transcendental,” says Sprangers. “I hope people can relate to what we do on some level. I hope kids like it. I hope moms like it. I don’t care about being cool, I just want to connect. I want people to know that no matter what, life is good, and every experience is meaningful. Maybe that’s weird. But we definitely feel like weirdos and we always have…maybe we always will, which is totally fine.“","<p>There are certain bands that demand to be listened in a certain way: Pink Floyd might require a bong & lazer light show; Led Zeppelin benefits from giant, wood-paneled speakers, and <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">FREE</span> <span class=""caps"">ENERGY</span></span>—a band responsible for having crafted some of the finest guitar-filled power pop this side of Weezer or Cheap Trick—should be played on a cassette deck in a Camaro screaming down the highway; stereo cranked, feather roach clip dangling from the rearview.</p> <p>“Being from the Midwest definitely informed our aesthetic,” says Free Energy vocalist Paul Sprangers. “Growing up in a small town with radio and <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">MTV</span></span>—then later discovering indie rock and punk rock—really shaped the kind of music we make now.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/josh-ritter","Josh Ritter","Moscow, Idaho","singer-songwriter, folk, acoustic","Over the clatter of piano and strum of an electric guitar that opens his fourth studio album, Josh Ritter leaps into rapid-fire lyrics that reference Joan of Arc, Calamity Jane and Florence Nightingale, all of whom seem to be stuck together in the belly of a whale. As the follow-up to last year's critically-acclaimed album The Animal Years, The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter is his most adventurous, fresh, and freewheeling work to date. While The Animal Years was a meticulously crafted and stately paean, for Conquests the artist radically revamped his working methods and his sound. “I needed to be somebody different,” the singer says. “The air of gravitas around me was getting oppressive. For some reason it seemed like there was a premium being placed on earnestness and that can be pretty stifling. There was a lot of talk about true love and righteous indignation. I wanted to write about gunslingers and missile silos.” The result is an often raucous, occasionally dizzying affair, with pounding keyboards, strings, horns, and his new producer and long-time collaborator Sam Kassirer, leading the charge. About the recording conditions in the Maine farmhouse where the record was made, Ritter enthuses, “You should have seen it up there. It was January and twenty below. We had horns in the attic, we had strings in the barn, we had a gaggle of people shooting targets with bb guns in the woods. It was a full house and everyone was there to throw themselves at the music. There was no holding back.” The artistic leaps Josh Ritter displays on Conquests are not without their stepping-stones, however. On a conceptual level, Paul McCartney’s Ram served as an ever-present reminder to enjoy the process of writing. Ritter was attracted to the free-spirited quality of the solo album McCartney made at his own farmhouse—amidst the Beatles’ tumultuous breakup: “It sounded like he had something to prove, but also like he didn’t really care. In terms of my favorite records, Ram is more about the philosophy. If this guy can do this after what he came through, then, okay, maybe I could try something like this too. It really loosened me up.” Stepping farther back, he cites Buddy Holly’s apocryphal ""The Apartment Tapes"" as a major influence. “A friend passed me Buddy Holly’s Apartment Tapes. The tapes are plain and genius. Buddy sang ‘Learning the Game’ and ‘That’s What they Say’ in his apartment in New York City and you can hear his wife bumping around in the kitchen and the whole thing feels clear but not simple. Those recordings feel like a Raymond Carver story. I listen to him and remember that it doesn’t have to be all nine-minute songs. That guy can get more across in a couplet than some people are lucky to learn in their whole life.” Given the new lyrical and musical trails that he is blazing, The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter proves that one can still cross any number of Rubicons all the while not taking themselves too seriously. Historic indeed.","<p align=""left""> Over the clatter of piano and strum of an electric guitar that opens his fourth studio album, Josh Ritter leaps into rapid-fire lyrics that reference Joan of Arc, Calamity Jane and Florence Nightingale, all of whom seem to be stuck together in the belly of a whale.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/passion-pit","Passion Pit","CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts, Un","indie, electronica, electronic, indie pop","Getting to Where We Belong: The Making of Passion Pit’s Gossamer “Hideaway” Hundreds of hipsters, college kids and music biz schmoozers gather under a massive white tent to see Passion Pit. It is an afternoon shindig hosted by the blog Brooklyn Vegan, at the 2009 South by Southwest festival. The sun is setting and it is a classic make-it-or-break-it moment for Passion Pit, who is headlining despite having just released a lone EP, Chunk of Change. The crowd is giddy on both free Izze fruit soda and the Boston band’s bubbly pop. Between songs, frontman Michael Angelakos runs his fingers and sweat through his thick, curly, Greek hair. He starts to rant—about a shirt he bought for his new girlfriend, about veganism, about inane blog comments. After a few awkward minutes, the music kicks back in. By the end of the performance, Michael is rolling on a red Persian rug amongst many, many keyboard and effects pedal cables, clutching his microphone, wailing in his signature helium falsetto. The audience cheers, the Tweeters tweet, the bloggers blog ecstatically. Michael leaves the stage and begins crying. He has made it, and he has broken. When the festival ends, the rest of the Passion Pit guys van back to Massachusetts. Michael stays behind in Texas. He calls a friend for support and begs her to come be with him. In a panic, he buys her a plane ticket. It is for the wrong year, 2010. He calls his parents in Buffalo, New York. “I’m going to a hospital,” he tells them. Michael is standing with his father outside a hospital in Houston, looking at mock-ups of album artwork on his cellphone. Passion Pit has just signed to Columbia Records, and a debut album, Manners, is due in a couple months. The record cover is green and messy and murky. Michael is not crazy about it, but there is no time, as the hospital is about to take his phone away from him. “It looks fine, Michael,” his dad says. “Just go.” In the hospital, Michael is not allowed to talk about work. “Up there, onstage, you’re alone, darling, ” a nurse tells him. “And if your life evolves into ruin, everyone will watch what you’re doing.” Michael thinks these would make good lyrics. His friends smuggle in positive reviews of Manners. When one magazine blesses the record with an 8 out of ten, he almost cries again. “I’ll Be Alright” This first sentence was not always the first. Originally, I was going to start with a simile: Michael Angelakos’ brain is like a shaken can of spray paint with no nozzle. Millions of particles of bright ideas bounce around in there. When inspiration punctures his head, art sprays out. Often, someone else must puncture the can, or smash it. Only, if you hold Michael’s bursting skull up to a canvas, you would not get a cloudy splatter of dripping bits. The paint would land perfectly in a detailed map of the knotty Tokyo subway system. You can hear this “I’ll Be Alright,” the second song on Gossamer, in which a sudden seizure of skittering programmed drums swarms over diced synths. “My brain is racing and I feel like I’ll explode!” Michael sings amidst the orchestral glitch. He compares it to the sensation you feel after an orgasm. Writing about creativity is like architecturing about dance. When I sat down to describe Michael’s thought process, a can of paint formed in my mind for whatever reason. After that, I thought no nozzle, because I like the alliteration. Then I tacked on a subject and verb. I start with a phrase, an image or a rhythm of words and construct around it. I’m not a beginning-to-end sentence builder. Michael asked me to write this piece because he intuited, correctly, that my writing is akin to his song crafting. A spark of a Passion Pit song might be found in the fuzz of a guitar pedal. It might be a stumbled-upon drum loop, the tintinnabulation of layered chimes or some gibberish harmony he’s humming. It might be one of the 200 scratch melodies Michael has stored on his iPhone. Later, Michael might sit at a keyboard and work out a melody. “I do things backwards,” he admits, “and I’m a maximalist.” Indeed. The songs on Gossamer carry anywhere from 60 to 200 instrumental tracks, according to Michael. If you ask Alex Aldi, Michael’s engineer, the number 80 to 120. (The maximum output on their version of ProTools is 120 tracks.) Whatever, it’s a fuckton. But it’s important to talk to Alex. “Constant Conversations” When Alex and Michael set forth to record Gossamer in January of 2011, the two first rented a studio near the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn’s DUMBO neighborhood. Well, it was technically an office space. The new Passion Pit headquarters shared the building with digital media start-ups, dot.coms, that sort of thing, which were not appreciative of gut-rumbling bass bumps rattling the uninsulated walls. “We’d blast these huge R. Kelly–like booms,” Michael says. “There would be fists pounding the walls,” Alex remembers. The duo began working from 6PM to 6AM, partly to avoid pissing off the neighbors, partly because Michael is “really OCD about who’s hearing me” In the wee hours, Michael would toil at his array of keyboards, sequencers and computers. The fruit of this first stage is the stunning slow jam “Constant Conversations.” It’s the kind of stank-faced, flesh-slapping R&B groove that makes a name like “Passion Pit” sound positively filthy. That is, until you pay attention to the lyrics. They are not nocturnal; they are dark. “I’m drunker than before / They told me drinking doesn’t make me nice,” Michael sings. “Well, you’re standing in the kitchen and you’re pouring out my drink.” It’s important to pay attention to the lyrics. “Slip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life.” –“Mirrored Sea” What makes Southern California’s orange sherbet sunsets so gorgeous? It’s the life-strangling smog. Toxic clouds can sometimes lead to beauty. In June of 2011, Michael headed to L.A. to continue work on Gossamer with a variety of big name producers. One producer would bring in pretty girls to sit on a couch in the studio. He would play back tracks at top volume. If the girls got up and danced, it was a hit. Michael slept in another studio beneath the control room, where he could hear some dude fucking people’s brains out all night. The walls were marble. Michael slept where Fiona Apple once slept. Michael recorded in a fancy house outside of which photographers snapped model in lingerie. Michael worked with a prominent hip-hop producer. They tinkered with “Hideaway,” an upbeat tune set to a speech a nurse once gave him. Michael played the hip-hop producer his demo. “You don’t need anyone to produce you,” the producer humbly admitted. Michael flew back to Brooklyn, ending what he now calls his “June gloom.” “Everyone let’s me make these mistakes,” Michael says. “Carried Away” “He plays music so loud in his headphones, I can hear everything he’s doing. When he’s working, he won’t get up to use the bathroom or to take a sip of water. Watching him is watching someone in their element, someone doing what they were born to do. But it can be a waiting game for him to get an idea. Then, bam, ninety minutes later there’s this amazing finished song. He does stuff on the fly. Michael thrives on that, the immediate pressure. Everyone else game-plans. The game-plan is in Michael’s head and he’s twenty steps ahead. Conveying that is difficult. It’s information overload.’” — engineer Alex Aldi “It’s Not My Fault, I’m Happy” Aside from the sarcastic “Love Is Greed,” all the songs on Gossamer are one-hundred-percent true. I know this because I’ve compared the lyric sheet to a 3,672 word life story Michael emailed me. It begins, “A main talking point seems to be about the fact that there is a dichotomy in my music.” It ends with, “The next day I quit drinking.” I read it one evening while listening to “It’s Not My Fault I’m Happy” repeatedly as tears welled in my eyes. Unlike some songwriters, Michael does not write in character. He compares the album to a collection of John Cheever stories. “It’s non-fiction, but dramatized. It’s euphoric pain,” he tells me. The record is more intimate than that. Listening and reading along, I feel as if I am reading his chart. I am eavesdropping. I am putting him inside one of the TSA’s full-body millimeter wave scanners. Ah, I think, “Take A Walk” must be about his father and his father’s father, his Papou, who sold old roses and owned a candy kitchen, using his savings to bring his village to America. Hearing the celestas and xylophones skittering about the opening of “Love Is Greed,” I envision bolts of blue electricity flashing across Michael’s grey matter. The systolic, panicked pulse of “Mirrored Sea” is awash in adrenaline and amphetamine salts. The pomp and silver twinkle of “On My Way” is confetti for a forthcoming wedding. “Are you sure you want to be this open,” Alex asked when he first heard the lyrics. “This music is so on point with myself, I don’t know that I could do it any other way,” Michael replied. Yes, Michael’s music juxtaposes dark subject matter and ebullient pop. It is at once escape and reality. It is also consciously androgynous. In the past, this was suitably captured with Michael’s falsetto. Now the unisexuality is enhanced by Erato, a female Swedish a cappella trio, two brunettes and one blonde, who went viral with a performance of Robyn’s “Call Your Girlfriend” on empty yogurt cups. Michael likes the idea of us not being able to discern if he or they are singing in certain parts. This is not duality or dichotomy. This is depth and honesty. Human beings are emotional, messy and murky creatures. “On My Way” It is a misconception that Manners was written for a girl. It was a record about Michael. Gossamer was written for a couple. “It’s an album about making an album that’s straining the relationship that’s helping you make that album. But say it better than that,” he tells me. Kristy is an editor for a prominent food website. Her face appears throughout the Gossamer artwork. The back cover is a letter Michael wrote to her. He proposes to her in the chorus of “On My Way.” Originally the tune was called “Ballerina.” “Just believe in me Kristina,” he sings. “All these demons, I can beat ’em.” “Where We Belong” Upon returning to Brooklyn from California, Michael reconnected with producer Chris Zane, who helmed Manners. Here is a sporting analogy, hockey specifically, according to Michael: “Chris is the general manager and Alex is the coach. Without Chris I wouldn’t have been able to do this record. Without Alex I wouldn’t have been able to do anything.” Alex is ten years Michael’s senior, Chris a little older. Michaels refers to them as his older brother and his older, older brother. The trio hunkered down in Gigantic Studios and started over on Gossamer as a mild winter fell upon New York. Michael admits he will often redo songs “like thirteen times. It’s one of my worst habits.” Manners was largely built on three keyboards. There was a conscious effort this time to avoid the same process, to use more organic ingredients. Composer Nico Muhly dropped in, dueling pianos with Michael on “Love Is Greed” and arranging strings. That being said, there were still dozens of keyboards, walls of keyboards, “some Herbie Hancock shit.” Yamahas, Moogs, Arps, MS-20s, SH-101s, Junos, Prophets, a Japanese piano. They flipped over a couch in the control room to stuff in even more keyboards. Ask Michael to explain the differences between these many keyboards and he synesthetically describes it by texture: “One is felt, one is 100% cotton, one is tweed…” Alex would watch and listen in a busted La-Z-Boy recliner permanently stuck in the recumbent position. “I did a calculation of the time I spent on this record. It was 4% of my life,” Alex tells me. He has recently heard the finished record. We chat about the sequence of the songs and debate the decision to cut a string section that originally opened the album. “It dawned on me this morning” he says. “After having a best friend for thirteen months, Michael is gone. I’m like, what the fuck do I do now?” When I hang up, I must immediately play Gossamer again.","<p>Getting to Where We Belong: The Making of Passion Pit’s Gossamer</p> <p>“Hideaway”</p> <p>Hundreds of hipsters, college kids and music biz schmoozers gather under a massive white tent to see Passion Pit. It is an afternoon shindig hosted by the blog Brooklyn Vegan, at the 2009 South by Southwest festival. The sun is setting and it is a classic make-it-or-break-it moment for Passion Pit, who is headlining despite having just released a lone EP, Chunk of Change. The crowd is giddy on both free Izze fruit soda and the Boston band’s bubbly pop. Between songs, frontman Michael Angelakos runs his fingers and sweat through his thick, curly, Greek hair. He starts to rant—about a shirt he bought for his new girlfriend, about veganism, about inane blog comments. After a few awkward minutes, the music kicks back in. By the end of the performance, Michael is rolling on a red Persian rug amongst many, many keyboard and effects pedal cables, clutching his microphone, wailing in his signature helium falsetto. The audience cheers, the Tweeters tweet, the bloggers blog ecstatically.</p> <p>Michael leaves the stage and begins crying. He has made it, and he has broken.</p> <p>When the festival ends, the rest of the Passion Pit guys van back to Massachusetts. Michael stays behind in Texas. He calls a friend for support and begs her to come be with him. In a panic, he buys her a plane ticket. It is for the wrong year, 2010. He calls his parents in Buffalo, New York. “I’m going to a hospital,” he tells them.</p> <p>Michael is standing with his father outside a hospital in Houston, looking at mock-ups of album artwork on his cellphone. Passion Pit has just signed to Columbia Records, and a debut album, Manners, is due in a couple months. The record cover is green and messy and murky. Michael is not crazy about it, but there is no time, as the hospital is about to take his phone away from him. “It looks fine, Michael,” his dad says. “Just go.”</p> <p>In the hospital, Michael is not allowed to talk about work. “Up there, onstage, you’re alone, darling, ” a nurse tells him. “And if your life evolves into ruin, everyone will watch what you’re doing.” Michael thinks these would make good lyrics. His friends smuggle in positive reviews of Manners. When one magazine blesses the record with an 8 out of ten, he almost cries again.</p> <p>“I’ll Be Alright”</p> <p>This first sentence was not always the first. Originally, I was going to start with a simile: Michael Angelakos’ brain is like a shaken can of spray paint with no nozzle. Millions of particles of bright ideas bounce around in there. When inspiration punctures his head, art sprays out. Often, someone else must puncture the can, or smash it. Only, if you hold Michael’s bursting skull up to a canvas, you would not get a cloudy splatter of dripping bits. The paint would land perfectly in a detailed map of the knotty Tokyo subway system.</p> <p>You can hear this “I’ll Be Alright,” the second song on Gossamer, in which a sudden seizure of skittering programmed drums swarms over diced synths. “My brain is racing and I feel like I’ll explode!” Michael sings amidst the orchestral glitch. He compares it to the sensation you feel after an orgasm.</p> <p>Writing about creativity is like architecturing about dance. When I sat down to describe Michael’s thought process, a can of paint formed in my mind for whatever reason. After that, I thought no nozzle, because I like the alliteration. Then I tacked on a subject and verb. I start with a phrase, an image or a rhythm of words and construct around it. I’m not a beginning-to-end sentence builder. Michael asked me to write this piece because he intuited, correctly, that my writing is akin to his song crafting.</p> <p>A spark of a Passion Pit song might be found in the fuzz of a guitar pedal. It might be a stumbled-upon drum loop, the tintinnabulation of layered chimes or some gibberish harmony he’s humming. It might be one of the 200 scratch melodies Michael has stored on his iPhone. Later, Michael might sit at a keyboard and work out a melody. “I do things backwards,” he admits, “and I’m a maximalist.” Indeed. The songs on Gossamer carry anywhere from 60 to 200 instrumental tracks, according to Michael. If you ask Alex Aldi, Michael’s engineer, the number 80 to 120. (The maximum output on their version of ProTools is 120 tracks.) Whatever, it’s a fuckton. But it’s important to talk to Alex.</p> <p>“Constant Conversations”</p> <p>When Alex and Michael set forth to record Gossamer in January of 2011, the two first rented a studio near the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn’s <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">DUMBO</span></span> neighborhood. Well, it was technically an office space. The new Passion Pit headquarters shared the building with digital media start-ups, dot.coms, that sort of thing, which were not appreciative of gut-rumbling bass bumps rattling the uninsulated walls.</p> <p>“We’d blast these huge R. Kelly–like booms,” Michael says. “There would be fists pounding the walls,” Alex remembers.</p> <p>The duo began working from 6PM to 6AM, partly to avoid pissing off the neighbors, partly because Michael is “really <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">OCD</span></span> about who’s hearing me” In the wee hours, Michael would toil at his array of keyboards, sequencers and computers.</p> <p>The fruit of this first stage is the stunning slow jam “Constant Conversations.” It’s the kind of stank-faced, flesh-slapping R&B groove that makes a name like “Passion Pit” sound positively filthy. That is, until you pay attention to the lyrics. They are not nocturnal; they are dark. “I’m drunker than before / They told me drinking doesn’t make me nice,” Michael sings. “Well, you’re standing in the kitchen and you’re pouring out my drink.”</p> <p>It’s important to pay attention to the lyrics.</p> <p>“Slip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life.” <br /> –“Mirrored Sea”<br /> What makes Southern California’s orange sherbet sunsets so gorgeous? It’s the life-strangling smog. Toxic clouds can sometimes lead to beauty.</p> <p>In June of 2011, Michael headed to L.A. to continue work on Gossamer with a variety of big name producers. One producer would bring in pretty girls to sit on a couch in the studio. He would play back tracks at top volume. If the girls got up and danced, it was a hit.</p> <p>Michael slept in another studio beneath the control room, where he could hear some dude fucking people’s brains out all night. The walls were marble.</p> <p>Michael slept where Fiona Apple once slept. Michael recorded in a fancy house outside of which photographers snapped model in lingerie. Michael worked with a prominent hip-hop producer. They tinkered with “Hideaway,” an upbeat tune set to a speech a nurse once gave him. Michael played the hip-hop producer his demo. “You don’t need anyone to produce you,” the producer humbly admitted. Michael flew back to Brooklyn, ending what he now calls his “June gloom.”</p> <p>“Everyone let’s me make these mistakes,” Michael says.</p> <p>“Carried Away”</p> <p>“He plays music so loud in his headphones, I can hear everything he’s doing. When he’s working, he won’t get up to use the bathroom or to take a sip of water. Watching him is watching someone in their element, someone doing what they were born to do. But it can be a waiting game for him to get an idea. Then, bam, ninety minutes later there’s this amazing finished song. He does stuff on the fly. Michael thrives on that, the immediate pressure. Everyone else game-plans. The game-plan is in Michael’s head and he’s twenty steps ahead. Conveying that is difficult. It’s information overload.’” — engineer Alex Aldi</p> <p>“It’s Not My Fault, I’m Happy”</p> <p>Aside from the sarcastic “Love Is Greed,” all the songs on Gossamer are one-hundred-percent true. I know this because I’ve compared the lyric sheet to a 3,672 word life story Michael emailed me. It begins, “A main talking point seems to be about the fact that there is a dichotomy in my music.” It ends with, “The next day I quit drinking.” I read it one evening while listening to “It’s Not My Fault I’m Happy” repeatedly as tears welled in my eyes.</p> <p>Unlike some songwriters, Michael does not write in character. He compares the album to a collection of John Cheever stories. “It’s non-fiction, but dramatized. It’s euphoric pain,” he tells me.</p> <p>The record is more intimate than that. Listening and reading along, I feel as if I am reading his chart. I am eavesdropping. I am putting him inside one of the <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">TSA</span></span>’s full-body millimeter wave scanners.</p> <p>Ah, I think, “Take A Walk” must be about his father and his father’s father, his Papou, who sold old roses and owned a candy kitchen, using his savings to bring his village to America.</p> <p>Hearing the celestas and xylophones skittering about the opening of “Love Is Greed,” I envision bolts of blue electricity flashing across Michael’s grey matter. The systolic, panicked pulse of “Mirrored Sea” is awash in adrenaline and amphetamine salts. The pomp and silver twinkle of “On My Way” is confetti for a forthcoming wedding.</p> <p>“Are you sure you want to be this open,” Alex asked when he first heard the lyrics.</p> <p>“This music is so on point with myself, I don’t know that I could do it any other way,” Michael replied.</p> <p>Yes, Michael’s music juxtaposes dark subject matter and ebullient pop. It is at once escape and reality. It is also consciously androgynous. In the past, this was suitably captured with Michael’s falsetto. Now the unisexuality is enhanced by Erato, a female Swedish a cappella trio, two brunettes and one blonde, who went viral with a performance of Robyn’s “Call Your Girlfriend” on empty yogurt cups. Michael likes the idea of us not being able to discern if he or they are singing in certain parts. This is not duality or dichotomy. This is depth and honesty.

He has immersed himself completely in a world of delicate symphonic compositions generating near weightless orchestral pieces. Arnalds explores the crossover from classical to pop by mixing chamber strings and piano with discreet electronics which makes him a perfect fit for cinematic music label Erased Tapes. His motivations are clear: ‘The classical scene is kind of closed to people who haven’t been studying music all their lives. I would like to bring my classical influence to the people who don’t usually listen to this kind of music…open people’s minds.’ Through relentless touring and determination this young artist has steadily gained recognition worldwide since his 2007 debut ‘Eulogy for Evolution’. His 2008 follow-up EP ‘Variations of Static’ earned Ólafur acclaim from both the contemporary and classical field – transcending a traditional divide. He has sold out some of the world’s most renowned music venues including Barbican Hall in London and has been awarded ‘Best Live Session of 2008’ by BBC Radio 1 presenter Gilles Peterson. Over the past eighteen months Arnalds has advanced from a former support-act for Sigur Rós to an internationally respected artists in his own right. In April 2009 Arnalds created the 7 song series ‘Found Songs’ – recording a song a day for 7 days and instantly making each track available via Twitter and the official Erased Tapes website with over 300.000 people downloading for free. December 2009 saw the release of Ólafur’s contemporary dance score ‘Dyad 1909’, commissioned by the award-winning choreographer Wayne McGregor. The dance piece, inspired by Shackleton’s South Pole premiered at the Sadler’s Wells theatre in October 2009 and became a much talked about 5-nights of live music, dance and visuals. BBC Four, the ITV1 South Bank Show and Arte TV Europe broadcasted ‘Dyad 1909’ on primetime television. In March 2010 he embarked on his first ever China Tour, which included sold-out shows in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing, and a live webcast watched by thousands of fans all round the world. Ólafur Arnalds’ second full-length album ‘…and they have escaped the weight of darkness’, continues his mission to lure an indie-generation of pop and rock fans into an emotive world of beguiling electronic chamber music and delicate classical arrangements. The sense of an organic crossover recording is reinforced by the involvement of co-producer Barði Jóhannsson of eccentric pop/rock/electronica-formation Bang Gang. Those expecting a mere continuation of the minimal melancholia of his previous albums are in for a surprise, as the record may be the most uplifting and richly orchestrated work of his career. ‘Precocious Nordic composer’s sumptuous second LP … Timeless and sublime’ **** – UNCUT ‘An artist of immense maturity’ (9/10) – Drowned In Sound","<p>Born in 1986, Ólafur hails from the suburban Icelandic town of Mosfellsbær, just a few kilometres outside of Reykjavík.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/jovanotti","Jovanotti","Cortona, Italy","hip-hop, pop, rap, italian","The 2011 Bonnaroo performance by the polyglot Tuscan artist Jovanotti (nee Lorenzo Cherubini) won over American live music fans, critics and industry alike. Among those taken by Jovanotti’s artistry and charisma was the leadership of ATO Records, which will introduce American audiences to him with Italia 1988-2012, a career retrospective including four new tracks, on August 7. This is the artist’s first physical album of studio recordings to be released in the U.S., and the first time much of the material has been released here in any format. Rather than a greatest hits collection, album producer Ian Brennan compiled and remixed what he considers Jovanotti’s most compelling material—the songs that exemplify the latter’s reputation as a Springsteen-style rock poet and a distinctive singer. (Jovanotti laughingly reacted to some of Brennan’s choices with, “Are you sure I recorded that song?”) The album also includes four altogether-new tracks: the new songs “New York for Life” and “Con La Luce Negli Occhi,” and radical reworkings of Jovanotti’s songs “La Porta É Aperta” (from the Ora album) and”Mezzogiorno” (from the Safari album). Brennan is a longtime Jovanotti fan who won a Grammy earlier this year for Tinariwen’s Tassili (Anti-); produced the debut of Rain Machine, the solo project of Kyp Malone (TV on the Radio); has helmed Grammy-nominated albums by Peter Case and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott; and has worked with Flea, Lucinda Williams, Nels Cline (Wilco), Fugazi, Green Day, Merle Haggard, Corin Tucker (Sleater-Kinney), Bill Frisell, Jonathan Richman and others. Jovanotti has already achieved rock star status in much of the rest of the world. In his native Italy, over the course of 25 years, he has sold over five million albums. Jovanotti’s most recent studio album, 2011’s Ora (Now), debuted at #1 there, went on to become the best-selling album of the year, and resulted in sell-outs over 50 arena and stadium dates. In the last few years, he has graced the cover of the Italian editions of Rolling Stone, GQ, Vanity Fair and L’Uomo Vogue, among other magazines. Outside Europe, Jovanotti has long been a favorite of Latin American listeners and artists, including Oscar winner Jorge Drexler and Juanes, with whom Jovanotti has collaborated live and on recent recordings. Although Jovanotti is still in his early 40s, a whole generation of younger Latin alternative artists grew up admiring him; he has in turn invited Los Amigos Invisibles, Ana Tijoux, Bomba Estereo and others to open for him on recent tours. Jovanotti has begun to spend a considerable amount of his time and career energies in the U.S. In the summer of 2009, he and a mostly US-based band performed 16 sold-out shows at downtown New York clubs. He has returned for brief stints in other parts of this country, including a performance at Central Park SummerStage in 2010, and earlier this year, with TV on the Radio, in The Music of The Rolling Stones Hot Rocks 1964-1971 at Carnegie Hall. This fall, Jovanotti will move to New York for a year. The relocation is a sort of return to origins for the artist, who counts The Beastie Boys as his primary influence (and, later in his life, collaborators and friends). When Jovanotti performed at the Bowery Ballroom in March 2012, he sang some lines from “No Sleep till Brooklyn.” He was not only acknowledging his whereabouts, but his beginnings, when he sported a sideways baseball cap and a “Get Off My Dick” t-shirt on the cover of his 1988 debut, the rap album Jovanotti for President.","<p>The 2011 Bonnaroo performance by the polyglot Tuscan artist Jovanotti (nee Lorenzo Cherubini) won over American live music fans, critics and industry alike.

When Jovanotti performed at the Bowery Ballroom in March 2012, he sang some lines from “No Sleep till Brooklyn.” He was not only acknowledging his whereabouts, but his beginnings, when he sported a sideways baseball cap and a “Get Off My Dick” t-shirt on the cover of his 1988 debut, the rap album Jovanotti for President.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7884270/ba258fd62b38848cb4cf99e298869377_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/cFOIWoiKK-g?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

After sitting in the orgone box planted in Burroughs’ back yard of Lawrence, Kansas in the midpoint of the 1990s, Thurston Moore came to the realization that at some point he’d need to form a band that played Burroughs Rock.

His set is characterized by lively, rapid-fire renditions of his poems, usually performed a cappella. He opened for Be-Bop Deluxe on their 1977 U.K. tour and later for Rockpile on their 1979 U.S. tour. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clarke enjoyed some chart success in the UK with the single “Gimmix! Play Loud”,1 and subsequent album Snap, Crackle & Bop. In 1979 he applied to join actors’ union Equity, but as there was already a member named John Cooper Clarke, he joined under the name Lenny Siberia.2 Performing in Cardiff, 1979 Often referred to as “the bard of Salford”,1 he usually refers to himself on stage as “Johnny Clarke, the name behind the hairstyle”. His first job was a laboratory technician at the University of Salford.3 Having released a handful of records into the early 1980s, Clarke performed his live act less frequently, and spent much of that decade addicted to heroin.4 He made an appearance in two UK adverts for Sugar Puffs in 1988, taking second billing to the Honey Monster. More recently, Clarke has turned some of his stage act away from an emphasis on performance poetry and towards more of a stand-up-oriented affair, but poetry is still very much a key part of his performance. He also supported Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros. He can often be seen supporting The Fall on British tours or performing as a headlining act in his own right. He also duetted with a poem entitled Last Resort with Reverend Jon McClure at a Reverend and the Makers concert at London’s Spread Eagle, which Later was released as the b-side for the band’s single “Heavyweight Champion of the World”. Clarke also recorded a song with the band entitled “Dead Man’s Shoes”. Clarke’s recording of “Evidently Chickentown” from his album Snap, Crackle & Bop was also featured prominently in the closing scene of The Sopranos episode Stage 5. A live performance of the same poem appears in the film Control with Clarke portraying himself in a re-creation of a 1977 concert where he supported Joy Division, despite having aged 30 years since the events depicted in the movie. Clarke had a “domestic partnership” with singer Nico in the 1980s.5 At Bedford’s Rhythm Festival, 2006 Clarke appeared in a 1982 music documentary compilation Urgh! A Music War, where he performed his poem “Health Fanatic”.6 The film featured live performances of main-stream artists (The Police, The Go-Gos, Pere Ubu, XTC, Devo) as well as more obscure bands (The Alley Cats, Invisible Sex, Athletico Spizz ’80, Chelsea) using concert footage from around the world. For many people, this was their first introduction to the works of John Cooper Clarke. He also starred in another 1982 film titled Ten Years in an Open Necked Shirt, produced for the Arts Council of Great Britain and Channel 4. Somewhere between a narrative film, a series of music videos, and a documentary, the film features interviews and performances by the poet.7 His poem “Out of Control Fairground” was printed inside Arctic Monkeys’ single “Fluorescent Adolescent” CD, which was released on 9 July 2007. The poem is also the inspiration behind the single’s video in which clowns brawl. Another poem was printed inside the 10"" release of the same single. Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys has said he is very fond of Cooper Clarke’s work and takes inspiration for lyrics from his poems.89 A version of his poem “Evidently Chickentown” is performed at the start and end of the video for Joy Division’s “Transmission” single which shows John Cooper Clarke reading the refrain and third verse from the poem whilst coming down escalators and then walking in the Manchester Arndale Centre. As of 2011, Clarke is still writing and performing, and regularly plays gigs all over the UK and abroad, reading new material as well as older favourites.","<p>Clarke has opened for such acts as the Sex Pistols, The Fall, Joy Division, Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Elvis Costello, and New Order (at their May 1984 Music for Miners benefit concert at London’s Royal Festival Hall).

Eleanor and Chris, who were married in 2009, spent most of the last year on tour with Steve Earle as an integral part of his band The Dukes and Duchesses. Each night, Earle stepped aside mid set and let the Mastersons play. The young couple took the opportunity to introduce audiences to songs from their debut record Birds Fly South, which will be available from New West Records on April 10th, 2012 as both a CD and limited edition 180-gram vinyl. The Mastersons will continue to play with The Dukes and Duchesses as Earle adds more tour dates, but also will be out on the road promoting Birds Fly South throughout 2012.Chris and Eleanor met in 2005 appropriately at a music festival; Chris was playing with Jack Ingram and Eleanor with Susan Gibson. Their accomplished songwriting talents and inherent musical ability have allowed them to co-write and play with many high-caliber musicians over the years. Chris, who at the age of 13 could be seen playing guitar regularly around his hometown of Houston, collaborated with Jack Ingram on the song “Don’t Want To Hurt” and co-wrote “Virginia Belle” and “Sleeping With The Lights On” with Pat Green for his record Cannonball. He’s played in Son Volt, with Bobby Bare Jr, Hank Williams III and Ingram. Eleanor, who fell in love with the violin after attending an Itzhak Perlman concert with her opera singer mother, has played with an impressive list of musicians herself including Regina Specktor, Diana Ross, Kelly Willis, Bruce Robison and Angus and Julia Stone. She also has co-writing credits including writing “Shape I’m In” with Susan Gibson (who wrote “Wide Open Spaces.”)Both Eleanor and Chris have released solo albums but Birds Fly South is the first Mastersons album. As Chris recently told the Houston Press ""We’ve been on the road so much the past few years it took some time to jell as one act,"" says Masterson. ""We’ve been writing songs as they came, and we finally started to sound like a band instead of a song swap. So we thought we were ready to do an album together.""On Birds Fly South, The Mastersons worked with friends in Austin including Grammy® Award Winning Engineer Steve Christensen to record their rootsy, melodic, twangy, pop songs. Eleanor’s whimsy, sultry vocals meet Chris’ angular guitar playing while their harmonies tangle as they sing dark words dressed in bright melodies. Chris and Eleanor showcase their musical talents playing most of the instruments on the record themselves. They both play electric and acoustic guitar, mandolin, and high strung guitar with Chris also playing 12-string and resonator guitars while Eleanor also adds tenor guitars, violin, and baritone violin. Rounding out the sound on the record is George Reiff playing bass guitar and Falcon Valdez on drums and percussion. Additional players include Mike Hardwick, Sweney Tidball and Andrew Duplantis. Produced collectively by Steve Christensen, Chris Masterson, George Reiff, Falcon Valdez, and Eleanor Whitmore, Birds Fly South was recorded at The Finishing School in Austin, TX.","<div> The Mastersons, a Brooklyn based band who make “music that fuses indie pop and folk music with big, sweet melodies…” (Houston Chronicle.)

Each song on this album rests on a juncture with a person, a real person, and it recounts a particular episode of life with that person. The scenes and the people are not especially unusual or stirring but the idea that the precise installment will never, in all of time, happen again was enough to interest Crain. She is taking a microscope to the simplest of human interactions and feelings, turning them over in her hands, looking at them from all angles, measuring them on all sides, and taking them apart, realizing they really are exceptional but only in the smallest ways. For a project that engages in so much dissection, Crain solicited Joey Lemon, producer of her Confiscation EP and guru of the Midwestern avant-garde band, Berry, to help her glue it all back together. They, along with Eric Nauni (Student Film) and Ben Wigler (Arizona, New Beard), recorded the eleven songs in 7 days at Joey’s studio in a white pole barn on the north side of Wichita, KS. Feeling the importance of giving each of these songs a sound as customized as the experiences and the people themselves, Crain reached out for different tools than on the country-tinged Songs In the Night LP. The guitars got fuzzier, the time signatures got modified, the drums got audacious, the spaces got bigger, the highs were higher, and the lows were lower. She got caught up in it, caught up in the decibels and the dynamics and the people. This is her attempt to preserve her contact with some human beings, 16 to be exact. There are 16 people that affected her through the writing and recording of these songs and You (Understood) is her monument to those sporadic and revered chapters.","<p>Anais Nin said, “Each contact with a human being is so rare, so precious, one should preserve it.” That suggestion was the muse impelling the conception of Samantha Crain’s second LP, You (Understood).

Just blocks from Brooklyn’s largest garbage dump, a group of people are huddled around a space heater in a wasted apartment above a metal shop. It seems like a place where things go to die. The view out the window reveals a strip club and a poultry slaughterhouse. Even by the standards of a city not known for its scenic beauty, it’s a dirty place. It’s in this primordial ooze that Fort Lean was born. For five old friends tired of working shit jobs, this is the very beginning, but it feels like the last chance. “You can only make so many heros,” quips frontman Keenan Mitchell. “Sandwich art is exhilarating, but I feel like I’m starting to run out of ideas.” Having holed up in their metal shop bunker, writing and rehearsing for the first two months of 2011, they played their early March debut in front of a sold out crowd. “Beach Holiday,” “Dreams (Never Come True),” “High Defintion,” and “Perfect” are the band’s first recordings. The result of a weekend recording session, the four songs were released for free on April 13. Fort Lean is on an urgent mission.

The disguise is fitting. The songs maintain a fuzzy glow beyond a thin veil of dust and distortion. All songs were committed live by playing electric guitar and singing through a tiny overblown Marshall practice amp. The songs were then left to their own ghosts, slowly to be taken by subtle string arrangements, hidden guitar feedback, distorted drum machines, and the occasional backbone of a full band. Brian Borcherdt has already found a devoted cult following through previous solo releases, such as Coyotes and the Moth EP, and found international acclaim through his polar opposite Holy Fuck. With Dusted he finds a fitting middle ground, unencumbered by the trappings of a solo singer/songwriter while offering something more lasting and personal than performance-based experimentation. Dusted came into focus in a small converted garage in Toronto through the helping hands of Leon Taheny, while a couple of songs crept up from a cabin in rural Nova Scotia.

Originally from Johannesberg, St. Lucia grew up performing with the Drakensberg Boys Choir School. When the choir wasn’t traveling – they toured Japan, Australia, Europe and more – they stayed in an enclave tucked in the South African mountains, learning everything from Bach to minimalist opera.A young musician could hardly find better training. But musically, St Lucia’s heart lay elsewhere, and South Africa was full of other rhythms. “My mom says I used to sing along to Michael Jackson,” he says – an ordinary anecdote, until he adds, “when I was an infant.” As a young teenager, he started to feel that he’d had his fill of classical, and it felt like an epiphany when he discovered the direct emotionality of pop. Eventually, he left the creative “small pond” of South Africa for England, where he spent three years studying music in Liverpool.St. Lucia’s journey ended – as so many journeys do – in New York City, where he started working on the tracks that would ultimately turn into his self titled debut release on Neon Gold. The atmospheric quality of St. Lucia’s electronic pop is powerful, with the musician’s global travels and history of secret hideaways effortlessly passed onto the audience through his dreamy, shimmering synths.Neon Gold will release St Lucia’s debut album later this year.

Whilst the band might not share actual familial bonds, the ties that keep this Nashville 6-piece together are just as strong.The Family began creating music together in Nashville in Fall 2007. What began as late night talks about life and dreams gradually flowed into eccentric, beautiful music. Kelsey and Gabe settled on the name (Kelsey’s last name lent itself well to a sort of ‘family band’ name), and recruited their friends to join the fold.Gabe (guitar, vocals) and Kelsey (vocals, keys) lead the family, along with Steven (lead guitar), Corey (bass), Markus (cello), and David (drums). The music is emotive, the lyrics evoking raw honesty and vulnerability. The band will undoubtedly capture your attention with their unmistakable power and presence. The sounds created by the booming and orchestral-like 6-piece challenge the listener’s ear and yet offer sweet melodies to sing along with. You’ll be dancing up a storm by the end of a Kopecky set, and perhaps also be holding a maraca or two!The band debuted their first EP, Embraces in 2008. In spring of 2010, the family packed into their 15-passenger van (lovingly called “The War Wagon”, RIP) and headed to Austin for their first SXSW. It was during their performance at Next Big Nashville in the same year that they picked up steam, catching the ears of some influential folks. They headed back into the studio after this with Partners in Crime, Russ Long and Chris Grainger (Wilco) and produced The Disaster EP which was released in August 2010.They trekked to New York City the same year, hitting up CMJ where they won over NPR‘s own Bob Boilen; and were invited to play the official Paste Magazine showcase. Straight back into the studio after CMJ, the band produced the follow up to The Disaster, the perfect compliment entitled Of Epic Proportions. The EP comprised digital B-Sides & rarities including “Howlin’ at the Moon“ and a remix of “God & Me”.A limited edition split 7″ vinyl with Seattle friends Ivan & Alyoshafollowed, as did several more tours and another SXSW jaunt. The band played 7 or so showcases this time around, with a marked performance at the infamous Paste Magazine showcase. And to keep themselves really busy early in 2011, the band played the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, notching up 3 amazing sets and amassing several new friends and fans along the way. In other 2011 news, a deal was inked management company Red Light. Large tours alongside GIVERS and Gomez helped close out a super successful year, as did another visit to CMJ.Early 2012 finally meant a break in the band’s relentless touring schedule, and the chance to get away to work on their debut full-length album, which had already begun with ideas and songs being hatched whilst on the road. After a co-headlining tour with The Lumineers in April, the family once again bunkered down to put the finishing touches on the album. The result is Kids Raising Kids, a culmination of 5 years of hard work shared amongst friends, family, and fans.

The result is <strong><em>Kids Raising Kids</em></strong>, a culmination of 5 years of hard work shared amongst friends, family, and fans. <br><br>Indie / Classical / Folk Rock<br><a href=""http://do512.com/event/2012/10/13/do512-lounge-sessions-presented-by-shiner-kopecky-family-band"">Watch videos of Kopecky Family Band playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!</a><br></p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7791504/6763c36e8e57b6e39da7be916dc9e72d_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/OcBWJ7YK9aM?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

Record stores, but they became a band in an even more rare and special space—a California basement, dug out somewhere between the mountains and the beach. They began gigging shortly after their conception in and around Los Angeles in the later part of 2008. It wasn’t until three years later that they would find the proper environment to record their first single “Long Journey” which now bookends their self-titled release. These were the kind of songs that bounced between London and Los Angeles, the kind of thing that could have come from Mick Jagger or Arthur Lee or both at once, with crystalline guitar and slow-mo drums that recalled the way the waves take big bites of the beach at night. This was mystery music from the strange and ancient-modern California fringe, more Night Tide than Easy Rider. Allah-Las were a reflection of a reflection, an echo of an echo, a band that was psychedelic not because of reverb or shredding through pedals but for the simple way their songs seem to extend to infinity.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-features","The Features","NASHVILLE","rock, indie, pop, modern","There are two groups with this name: When The Features signed to Universal Records in 2004, no one was surprised. They’d appeared on the Murfreesboro scene a decade earlier with an invigorating, quirky pop sound that lent itself to easy crowd participation with rowdy sing-alongs and whimsical handclaps. Immensely likable and talented, they were shoo-ins for local band most likely to succeed. So when news spread that the band were dropped in just under a year, fans were shocked. Sparking weeks of message-board rants and raves, the cause for the drop split their loyal following along the increasingly blurred line between art and commerce. The band had refused to cover a song for a commercial. The commercial? Chase Credit Cards. The song? The Beatles’ “All You Need Is Love.” From the cheap seats, it looked like the band might have shot themselves in the foot. In an age of MySpace, digital downloads and band branding, the formula for success is murkier than ever, and musicians are advised not to be too picky about who signs their paychecks. Artists must be shrewd businesspeople always looking for the next promotional opportunity, whether it’s ringtones, clothing lines or product endorsements, and commercial placement has both launched new careers and salvaged old ones. But The Features dug in their heels and opted not to take the money and run. Here’s why. It’s certainly a horror story we’ve heard before: band signs record deal, doesn’t get promoted. Label drops band for not selling enough records. In the music industry, success is a crapshoot. Lady luck gives with one hand and takes away with the other. Majors drop bands like most of us drop change in a tip jar, and they’ve practically turned career crushing into an art form. Just ask anybody courting label attention what it takes to score the elusive record deal, and they’ll give you a slew of contradictory messages about the equation for success. If you have great songs, you haven’t toured enough. Or if you’ve spanned the globe in a shitty van on a 3-dollar per diem, your image isn’t marketable. How’s your web presence these days? We don’t see that X factor. Or hey, you’re road warriors with great tunes and star appeal, but your songs don’t test well with the radio demographic. Maybe you’re over 25, or your live show’s not that exciting. Maybe they just don’t hear a single. That a band like The Features bypassed these roadblocks—they didn’t tour much, weren’t the types to stump for the cause and, after a decade together, hadn’t even released a full-length—is a feat in itself. Most bands never even get the deal. And the ones who do often talk of their stars aligning just right, as though some higher power were at hand. Though they’ve arguably had luck—songs with as much staying power as the fans they attract—it’s perseverance that has kept the band charging forward, through more than 10 years, two botched record deals, two lineup changes, three unreleased albums and two unexpected bundles of joy. The Features formed as middle-schoolers in Sparta, Tenn., a typically homogenous small Southern town about 15 miles outside of Cookeville that boasts bluegrass picker Lester Flatt as its musical calling card. The three original members—Matt Pelham on guitar and vocals, Don Sergio on guitar and Roger Dabbs on bass—came to Murfreesboro in the mid-’90s, where they met drummer Jason Taylor. Sergio brought friend and keyboardist Parrish Yaw on board, and they began playing their off-kilter pop with a slacker vibe, Hawaiian shirts and coordinated moves. Whereas most artists struggle to define their sound and attract a following, The Features never wanted for compelling songs, devout fans, industry attention or critical praise. They were an instant success at The Boro and Chameleon Café, long before the “The” bands had taken over, even before vintage keyboards and synthy waves made their resurgence. The darkly appealing Sergio was the heartthrob of the band, but Pelham’s shyness and introversion offstage in contrast to his possessed, kinetic live performances drew many a curious girl to the front of the crowd. So it wasn’t long before a new label in town came calling. Spongebath was the brainchild of former local Matt Mahaffey, along with veteran songsmith Seth Timbs and entrepreneur Richard Williams. The label’s roster included Mahaffey’s and Timbs’ groups—Self and Fluid Ounces—alongside acts like Gumption, The Roaries, The Katies and Count Bass D. Excitement buzzed around the hip new office in the ’Boro’s square, with its purple painted walls and ’70s pop-art logo. Fliers advertising Spongebath lineups—particularly those that included The Features—were guaranteed draws around town. Matt Meeks, who now co-manages The Features with Rory Daigle (both of whom did time at Spongebath during its heyday), remembers the first time he saw the band play, long before he knew them. “At first, I thought they were a Pavement ripoff,” Meeks says. “So I resisted liking them. Plus, at all their shows, there were always tons of girls up front fawning over them, just entranced. I was in a band at the time, and it made me not want to like them. But I ended up really liking them anyway.” There were four Features songs over two Spongebath samplers in 1998, Soaking in the Center of the Universe volumes I and II. But the first substantial introduction to the band was the previous year’s eponymous EP featuring the crowd favorite, “Armani Suede.” The track is a falsetto thrill with a jagged bounce that hinges on the slow burn from casual musing to frustrated explosion. Its love-obsessed subject matter would find its way into countless future songs. “Maybe she will / Maybe she won’t / Find what she’s looking for,” Pelham sings casually over a jaunty guitar riff and twinkling synth line. The jangle builds along a disco beat, then climaxes on the angry outburst, “I thought I knew / What you were going through / But I don’t!” Andy McLenon, who ran Nashville’s first indie rock label, Praxis, had since moved to a position as general manager at Spongebath. He’d heard about The Features through Williams. “He found The Features in a Pizza Hut,” McLenon says. “I don’t think that’s a legend—I think it’s true. I think they were still in high school. They were my favorite out of the batch. What I heard in them was like The Kinks. I heard the new Southern rock. That was part of what I did—I tried to figure out how to spin it. I know that sounds corny, but I thought that if The Kinks came to Sparta, they would sound like The Features.” Though the band technically came to Williams through Timbs, Williams did finalize Spongebath business with the band at a Pizza Hut. Myth aside, the band’s infectious live show confirmed McLenon’s suspicions. “I saw them live and they were so tight. I’d be thinking, if anybody saw this band they would see them as the premier band of the ’90s,” McLenon says. “My fantasy for them was that they’d define the new Southern rock. It used to bug them, ’cause they hated that phrase and at the time they didn’t like Southern rock. But to me it was just like the B-52s in Athens.” Despite the group’s inexperience with the industry machine, they were already showing early signs of what would become their reputation for staying tight-knit and tight-lipped about band affairs. “I’d never seen anything like them,” McLenon says. “They were so young, but they always seemed like they knew more than I knew about them. I could never figure them out, except that I knew they were great. If you had a meeting about something controversial—about something going on in their career at the time—they just stuck so together. You couldn’t separate them, no matter how much you tried. You’d leave not knowing. They’d never say, ‘This is what we think.’ They’d get all the information—this was so smart—they’d hear all your arguments and then say, ‘We need to talk about it.’ Then three days later you’d get their answer. This when they were nobodies. They were so tight.” But it wasn’t in the cards for Spongebath to make The Features a success. Self enjoyed premier status on the label, which wasn’t equipped to devote its meager resources beyond its star talent. The Features were stalled along with other acts on the roster like The Roaries and Fluid Ounces. “If we’d done things right, they’d have been huge,” McLenon says. “I felt they were ready way before they had the opportunity.” Not only had the band not been a priority at Spongebath, but they also produced three albums during that time that never saw the light of day. There’s speculation that Pelham’s insistence on perfection held up the records as much as the label’s inefficient handling of the band, which Pelham admits is partly true. “Part of that was the band, and part of that was Spongebath,” says Pelham, who speaks carefully and deliberately, and has the sort of thin, sensitive face and delicate features ideal for a Modigliani rendering. “It was mostly lack of confidence on Spongebath’s behalf. It seemed like they needed a band to break to have the money to put out a Features record. We recorded three records and none of them were this great thing that anyone thought would do something. It just ended up being this thing where I started second-guessing everything. You know—‘Is any of this really that good?’ I think that’s why some of that stuff never got released.” The band also lost two members over the stasis—Sergio and Taylor left in ’98—provoking its second setback. But it was a loss that soon proved fruitful. Rollum Haas assumed the sticks, and with a second guitarist gone from the band, Yaw’s circus whirl moved to the forefront, and Haas’ drumming—a maniacal beat that whips from trotting to hyperspeed on a dime—solidified the band’s sound. They no longer sounded like slackers, but like a tightly wound, adventurous pop band. With the new lineup, the band instead focused on singles, releasing the 10-inch “Thursday.” It’s a track that illustrates the band’s strengths, where musically sunny songs belie wistful lyrics and plangent frustration. It begins with a simple but propulsive pluck, the occasional guitar squiggle and swipe, and the yearning lyrics, “Thursday is the only day that I’ve been looking forward to / ’Cause Thursday is the only day that on my way I run into you.” Pelham’s voice shifts toward defeat on the next line, cracking into the whine, “I’ve been trying hard, I’ve been trying hard for a while / Change my walk, change my talk, change my hair, try to make you…smile.” The la-da-da-da’s kick in, overlapped by a drunken ya-da-da-da, before the song stomps off, headed for confrontation and chaos. It’s a scorned lover’s rebuke, but Pelham’s sweet frustration makes it sound harmless. If the band were finally ready to take a forward leap beyond local success, it would be now, with a solid lineup and a flawless batch of material. But there was another snag—or rather, two. Pelham learned his wife was pregnant, and he found himself the sole breadwinner of the family. 2001 brought an EP and a set of twin daughters. Recorded with local analog loyalist Brian Carter, the self-released The Beginning is a five-song tribute to impending fatherhood that shows the band alternately tender and fierce. But with newborns, extensive touring was suddenly impossible without substantial income for the band. Still, the songs cut through, and the EP was picked up two years later by UK label Fierce Panda, who had released singles from acts like Coldplay and Death Cab for Cutie. With that leverage, Daigle and Meeks began shopping it along with a three-song demo, which included the song “Blow It Out,” to various majors like Island, Atlantic, Warner Brothers and Universal. “We felt they were a major-label band,” says Meeks. “If they were at the right label, they could be successful at that level.” Universal bit. The A&R representative, Jolene Cherry, a former film music supervisor and head of the Cherry/Universal imprint, loved the band’s sound and worked up a one-year, two-option deal. That meant the band would release one record, giving the label the option to release the next two albums if they liked them, or release them from the terms if they didn’t. Along with the deal came an advance—six figures, according to Meeks—that gave the group enough money to make a record, tour and live for a year without day jobs. Out of all the labels they’d talked to, Universal seemed the most enthusiastic. “It came down to the excitement of the A&R person—her excitement for the band,” Pelham says. “She seemed to really have a genuine enthusiasm for what we were doing. But even with Universal, we wondered if it was the right thing for us, because they were mainly pop. They didn’t really have any rock records at the time.” Exhibit A was released on Sept. 14, 2004, in the States, the previous April in the UK. It’s a stunning 33-minute album that buzzes with addictive hooks and fervent pop gospel, and everything you’d expect from a debut that, in many ways, was some 10 years in the making. Search for press on the record, and you’ll have to dig just to find a lukewarm review. (One reviewer, referring to the lyrics of the single “Blow It Out,” remarks: “Ridiculous, expect it to be stuck in your head for days.”) But the album’s release was an early sign that the label wasn’t promoting the band as it should have been. “Before the record came out, there was pretty much no press and no publicity,” Pelham says. “But six months after the record came out, that’s when a press team really started working for us. And by that time, anyone at press had either already heard of us or said, ‘Well, this record’s been out for six months. It’s too late for us to write about it.’ It fell apart.” Though the label paid generously for the group to tour the UK a handful of times, most notably on a few runs with Kings of Leon, even those shows weren’t promoted. “We got really lucky with the Kings asking us out on the road,” Haas says. “But once again it seemed like the ducks weren’t in a row,” adds Pelham. “We would get there and there wouldn’t be promotion. It was really odd. The last tour we did with Kings of Leon—we heard at one point it was the biggest tour of the summer in the UK. We were the opening act for the biggest tour of the summer in the UK, and there was absolutely no press, no posters in the venues saying, ‘The Features, Exhibit A, Buy it now.’ ” The band received modest exposure for the track “Blow It Out,” notably a two-week run on CBS—but it wasn’t Universal who pushed the track to television. The CBS hookup was more serendipitous. An ad agency had heard the band and contacted them directly about using the song. The Features might have been more excited about potential exposure for their single, had they not been concerned with making a second record, which the label had already optioned. They’d sent demos to Cherry for consideration, with the answer that they should keep working on them. “The main time it started to go sour for me was when we were working on songs for the second record,” says Haas, who is the antithesis of Pelham’s quiet, reserved manner. He has a smiling, boyish face and speaks quickly with animated gesturing. “And it was the kind of thing where we were working very hard at it. Practicing a lot, trying to piece songs together and send them to our A&R person. Every time it was like, ‘No, this isn’t cutting it.’ That started to shake the confidence of the band.” Just as the deal with Spongebath left the band feeling like an afterthought, so did the deal with Universal. The record wasn’t selling well by industry standards—just over 12,000 copies in all were sold in the U.S., with UK sales thought to match that amount—and the single wasn’t getting the airplay the band or the label had hoped for. “The things I remember hearing were, ‘People at radio like it, but it doesn’t fit with what’s going on right now,’ ” Pelham says. “The Kaiser Chiefs had just been signed to Universal in the States, and their single ‘I Predict a Riot’ came out to radio when ‘Blow It Out’ did, and they said, ‘This is what’s big.’ I think all focus, if there was any focus on The Features, always seemed to get pushed to the backburner for something else—for another band. And that’s the way it is on a major. It’s sort of just priority. Just like on most labels.” With an ill-promoted record not exploding on radio, the label did what labels do. It sought to recoup its investment, and looked for a last-ditch effort to salvage the band’s career. All the band needed to do was cover a Beatles song for a Chase Credit Card commercial, put it on their second record and release it as a single. And not just any old Beatles song—one of the top Beatles songs of all time, used for the first worldwide televised broadcast in 1967: “All You Need Is Love.” It’s worth noting that The Beatles got their start playing covers. But all you need is love…and a 23-percent APR? It’s one of the least-covered Beatles songs due to its revered status, a flower-power anthem that espouses utopian ideals and astonishing optimism. It was incongruous to the band. “That Beatles song for that commercial feels really wrong to me,” says Haas. “As far as covering the song, whatever. If we were just to do that, cool. But using it for something like that seems wrong to me.” Not that the band were averse to putting a song in a commercial. “From the beginning it felt very wrong, the whole idea of it,” Pelham says. “If they had asked us to use one of our own songs, we would have considered it. But to ask us to cover a song without some sort of permission, especially ‘All You Need Is Love,’ seemed wrong.” And along with the request came pressure, the dangling carrot that the band’s career might be launched from this precarious move. “She [Cherry] said, ‘This is a great opportunity; it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,’ ” Pelham says. “ ‘This could potentially break the band. We put it on the record, it could be a single, and you can get the next record out.’ ” In their eyes, the label’s request showed a complete lack of confidence in the band. And not only did Universal need an answer, they needed it in an hour, with a finished song in two days. It’s not unusual for songs used in commercials to be turned around quickly—artists working on spec often churn out tracks in 24 hours to be considered for placement. But those are veterans, used to working under tight deadlines. The Features, used to working at their own pace, were understandably flustered. But far worse was the label’s response when the band admitted they didn’t think the cover was such a good idea. According to Pelham, the rep had already obligated the band to do the commercial, and when the band said they didn’t want to do it, Universal took a hard-line stance. The Features were two weeks away from entering the studio for their second record. “It’s so odd to wake up, get a phone call asking, ‘What do you think about this? Think about it for maybe 45 minutes to an hour,’ ” Pelham says. “Then being on the phone with the A&R person saying, ‘If you don’t do this, you’re gonna lose your record deal.’ We were so excited about going into the studio. Everything just completely changed.” If they’d had more time to discuss the cover, things might not have escalated within the band and become divisive to the point that keyboardist Parrish Yaw left the group. The band might not have shut down the message board on their site if the discussions of what the band should or shouldn’t have done hadn’t grown so heated. As Pelham puts it, “It was getting out of hand. People started taking it too seriously, and it was weird. We were just trying to figure out what happens next.” Pelham and Haas admit that despite the label’s botched efforts, they could have been better about promoting and networking—something they weren’t accustomed to in sleepy Murfreesboro, where they’d spent years honing their sound and perfecting their lineup. They have a certain childlike naïveté about the business, but it isn’t surprising. Pelham is a songwriter who finds joy in the little things—the monograms on his daughter’s clothes, the catharsis of a solitary jam session. It’s not that The Features aren’t smart guys or didn’t understand the consequences of their decision—it’s that they’ve never had to hustle for it. Their fans are as steady as they come, and it’s easy to see why a band in their favor would become complacent. This much they know. They’re intent on keeping the momentum going, even if that means dreaded networking. They’ve replaced Yaw with former De Novo Dahl keyboardist Mark Bond. All four band members are married, and Pelham of course has the twins to look after. But they’re getting used to thinking about video concepts and artwork for an EP, Contrast, that the band will self-release in September. And they will continue to seek a balance between their lives and their art. There’s talk of new label interest and showcases, but the band don’t want to discuss anything until it’s official. Meeks has even passed the torch of MySpace upkeep to Haas. Despite the experience with Universal, the band actually came out lucky—they were smart enough not to sign away their publishing. They aren’t sore toward major labels, and they realize compromise is necessary. To detractors who ranted on various forums about what they should or shouldn’t have done, Pelham and Haas are adamant that The Features made the right decision. “I think some people look at this like, ‘They had a deal, didn’t they know what that entails?’ ” Haas says. “But I think you still have to keep your integrity. You still have to do what feels right to you. Being on a major doesn’t mean doing whatever they ask and buckling to any pressure. “I’d like the band to be successful,” Haas continues. “I think that’d be really great. That’s a weird thing to say, though. I mean, I’d like the band to be successful, but I don’t know what it takes to do that exactly. What I have noticed is that historically, most bands that have been successful have had it together on every angle.” “I think there’s a lot of luck involved,” Pelham interjects. “We realize you have to ‘play ball,’ ” he adds, with an obvious distaste for the phrase. “Or make some sort of compromise, but I don’t think you should have to compromise….” “To that point I don’t think you should have to compromise,” Haas adds. “I think the band should be secondary to a lot of things we have going on sometimes,” says Pelham. “When we come home from work, we don’t want to go out or get on the Internet and start hyping the band, or go out and do public relations. Just because we want to spend time with our families. I guess if I had to choose, if someone told me, ‘You can’t be in this band unless you go out and network,’ I’d probably say, ‘OK, I guess I won’t be in the band.’ ” Meanwhile, the machine churns on. Nada Surf recorded the Beatles song, which you can currently hear on the Chase commercials airing on television. Online, fans of Nada Surf seem to like the cover, while critics shake their heads at the legacy of The Beatles being dragged through the muck in such a way. On a muggy Thursday night, Pelham and Haas are waiting around at Murfreesboro’s Grand Palace to sound check for their first show in months. The show, despite its secret status, packs the crowd into the cramped showroom and fills the hallway, so that necks must crane to catch a glimpse of the band. (A second secret show the following night at The Basement will sell out.) Despite no advertising and little air conditioning in the venue, the fans have still found their way to The Features, and their faces are old and new, with ages that range from 18 to 40-something. The band sound lean and mean onstage, although it could be that, with Bond on keys, Yaw’s two-fingered plunk and frenzied carnival organs have been replaced with a more formal subtlety. It moves the skeletal structure of the songs back into the foreground. The band debut new material that’s stronger than ever, like the glittery but pensive “Contrast.” “Look at what we have done / See the colors begin to fade,” Pelham croons in a soft warble. “Soon we’ll lose everyone / And they’ll only be shades of gray.” The song is meant to signal new beginnings. But its lyrics could be interpreted as a response to the controversy—that by holding true to their convictions, The Features have risked losing everything they have worked for, including making a career of playing music. A cynic might wonder whether anyone that naive belongs in the music industry, at a time when selling out is not a stigma but a strategic career move. But tonight, The Features are at home, before a crowd that will love them whether they sell 12,000 copies or shill for credit-card consumption. The band kick into a frenetic number called “Exorcising Demons,” and when it hits the chorus, “Demons / Be gone / Leave me alone tonight,” the crowd’s hands shoot up in the air with the beat, like a congregation testifying. Soon afterward, the show ends. And now The Features are about to learn whether love is really all you need. by Tracy Moore www.nashvillescene.com 2) The New Zealand post punk act who recorded two EP’s in the early 1980s.

They’d appeared on the Murfreesboro scene a decade earlier with an invigorating, quirky pop sound that lent itself to easy crowd participation with rowdy sing-alongs and whimsical handclaps. Immensely likable and talented, they were shoo-ins for local band most likely to succeed. So when news spread that the band were dropped in just under a year, fans were shocked. Sparking weeks of message-board rants and raves, the cause for the drop split their loyal following along the increasingly blurred line between art and commerce. The band had refused to cover a song for a commercial. The commercial? Chase Credit Cards. The song? The Beatles’ “All You Need Is Love.” From the cheap seats, it looked like the band might have shot themselves in the foot. In an age of MySpace, digital downloads and band branding, the formula for success is murkier than ever, and musicians are advised not to be too picky about who signs their paychecks. Artists must be shrewd businesspeople always looking for the next promotional opportunity, whether it’s ringtones, clothing lines or product endorsements, and commercial placement has both launched new careers and salvaged old ones. But The Features dug in their heels and opted not to take the money and run. Here’s why. It’s certainly a horror story we’ve heard before: band signs record deal, doesn’t get promoted. Label drops band for not selling enough records. In the music industry, success is a crapshoot. Lady luck gives with one hand and takes away with the other. Majors drop bands like most of us drop change in a tip jar, and they’ve practically turned career crushing into an art form. Just ask anybody courting label attention what it takes to score the elusive record deal, and they’ll give you a slew of contradictory messages about the equation for success. If you have great songs, you haven’t toured enough. Or if you’ve spanned the globe in a shitty van on a 3-dollar per diem, your image isn’t marketable. How’s your web presence these days? We don’t see that X factor. Or hey, you’re road warriors with great tunes and star appeal, but your songs don’t test well with the radio demographic. Maybe you’re over 25, or your live show’s not that exciting. Maybe they just don’t hear a single. That a band like The Features bypassed these roadblocks—they didn’t tour much, weren’t the types to stump for the cause and, after a decade together, hadn’t even released a full-length—is a feat in itself. Most bands never even get the deal. And the ones who do often talk of their stars aligning just right, as though some higher power were at hand. Though they’ve arguably had luck—songs with as much staying power as the fans they attract—it’s perseverance that has kept the band charging forward, through more than 10 years, two botched record deals, two lineup changes, three unreleased albums and two unexpected bundles of joy. The Features formed as middle-schoolers in Sparta, Tenn., a typically homogenous small Southern town about 15 miles outside of Cookeville that boasts bluegrass picker Lester Flatt as its musical calling card. The three original members—Matt Pelham on guitar and vocals, Don Sergio on guitar and Roger Dabbs on bass—came to Murfreesboro in the mid-’90s, where they met drummer Jason Taylor. Sergio brought friend and keyboardist Parrish Yaw on board, and they began playing their off-kilter pop with a slacker vibe, Hawaiian shirts and coordinated moves. Whereas most artists struggle to define their sound and attract a following, The Features never wanted for compelling songs, devout fans, industry attention or critical praise. They were an instant success at The Boro and Chameleon Café, long before the “The” bands had taken over, even before vintage keyboards and synthy waves made their resurgence. The darkly appealing Sergio was the heartthrob of the band, but Pelham’s shyness and introversion offstage in contrast to his possessed, kinetic live performances drew many a curious girl to the front of the crowd. So it wasn’t long before a new label in town came calling. Spongebath was the brainchild of former local Matt Mahaffey, along with veteran songsmith Seth Timbs and entrepreneur Richard Williams. The label’s roster included Mahaffey’s and Timbs’ groups—Self and Fluid Ounces—alongside acts like Gumption, The Roaries, The Katies and Count Bass D. Excitement buzzed around the hip new office in the ’Boro’s square, with its purple painted walls and ’70s pop-art logo. Fliers advertising Spongebath lineups—particularly those that included The Features—were guaranteed draws around town. Matt Meeks, who now co-manages The Features with Rory Daigle (both of whom did time at Spongebath during its heyday), remembers the first time he saw the band play, long before he knew them. “At first, I thought they were a Pavement ripoff,” Meeks says. “So I resisted liking them. Plus, at all their shows, there were always tons of girls up front fawning over them, just entranced. I was in a band at the time, and it made me not want to like them. But I ended up really liking them anyway.” There were four Features songs over two Spongebath samplers in 1998, Soaking in the Center of the Universe volumes I and II. But the first substantial introduction to the band was the previous year’s eponymous EP featuring the crowd favorite, “Armani Suede.” The track is a falsetto thrill with a jagged bounce that hinges on the slow burn from casual musing to frustrated explosion. Its love-obsessed subject matter would find its way into countless future songs. “Maybe she will / Maybe she won’t / Find what she’s looking for,” Pelham sings casually over a jaunty guitar riff and twinkling synth line. The jangle builds along a disco beat, then climaxes on the angry outburst, “I thought I knew / What you were going through / But I don’t!” Andy McLenon, who ran Nashville’s first indie rock label, Praxis, had since moved to a position as general manager at Spongebath. He’d heard about The Features through Williams. “He found The Features in a Pizza Hut,” McLenon says. “I don’t think that’s a legend—I think it’s true. I think they were still in high school. They were my favorite out of the batch. What I heard in them was like The Kinks. I heard the new Southern rock. That was part of what I did—I tried to figure out how to spin it. I know that sounds corny, but I thought that if The Kinks came to Sparta, they would sound like The Features.” Though the band technically came to Williams through Timbs, Williams did finalize Spongebath business with the band at a Pizza Hut. Myth aside, the band’s infectious live show confirmed McLenon’s suspicions. “I saw them live and they were so tight. I’d be thinking, if anybody saw this band they would see them as the premier band of the ’90s,” McLenon says. “My fantasy for them was that they’d define the new Southern rock. It used to bug them, ’cause they hated that phrase and at the time they didn’t like Southern rock. But to me it was just like the B-52s in Athens.” Despite the group’s inexperience with the industry machine, they were already showing early signs of what would become their reputation for staying tight-knit and tight-lipped about band affairs. “I’d never seen anything like them,” McLenon says. “They were so young, but they always seemed like they knew more than I knew about them. I could never figure them out, except that I knew they were great. If you had a meeting about something controversial—about something going on in their career at the time—they just stuck so together. You couldn’t separate them, no matter how much you tried. You’d leave not knowing. They’d never say, ‘This is what we think.’ They’d get all the information—this was so smart—they’d hear all your arguments and then say, ‘We need to talk about it.’ Then three days later you’d get their answer. This when they were nobodies. They were so tight.” But it wasn’t in the cards for Spongebath to make The Features a success. Self enjoyed premier status on the label, which wasn’t equipped to devote its meager resources beyond its star talent. The Features were stalled along with other acts on the roster like The Roaries and Fluid Ounces. “If we’d done things right, they’d have been huge,” McLenon says. “I felt they were ready way before they had the opportunity.” Not only had the band not been a priority at Spongebath, but they also produced three albums during that time that never saw the light of day. There’s speculation that Pelham’s insistence on perfection held up the records as much as the label’s inefficient handling of the band, which Pelham admits is partly true. “Part of that was the band, and part of that was Spongebath,” says Pelham, who speaks carefully and deliberately, and has the sort of thin, sensitive face and delicate features ideal for a Modigliani rendering. “It was mostly lack of confidence on Spongebath’s behalf. It seemed like they needed a band to break to have the money to put out a Features record. We recorded three records and none of them were this great thing that anyone thought would do something. It just ended up being this thing where I started second-guessing everything. You know—‘Is any of this really that good?’ I think that’s why some of that stuff never got released.” The band also lost two members over the stasis—Sergio and Taylor left in ’98—provoking its second setback. But it was a loss that soon proved fruitful. Rollum Haas assumed the sticks, and with a second guitarist gone from the band, Yaw’s circus whirl moved to the forefront, and Haas’ drumming—a maniacal beat that whips from trotting to hyperspeed on a dime—solidified the band’s sound. They no longer sounded like slackers, but like a tightly wound, adventurous pop band. With the new lineup, the band instead focused on singles, releasing the 10-inch “Thursday.” It’s a track that illustrates the band’s strengths, where musically sunny songs belie wistful lyrics and plangent frustration. It begins with a simple but propulsive pluck, the occasional guitar squiggle and swipe, and the yearning lyrics, “Thursday is the only day that I’ve been looking forward to / ’Cause Thursday is the only day that on my way I run into you.” Pelham’s voice shifts toward defeat on the next line, cracking into the whine, “I’ve been trying hard, I’ve been trying hard for a while / Change my walk, change my talk, change my hair, try to make you…smile.” The la-da-da-da’s kick in, overlapped by a drunken ya-da-da-da, before the song stomps off, headed for confrontation and chaos. It’s a scorned lover’s rebuke, but Pelham’s sweet frustration makes it sound harmless. If the band were finally ready to take a forward leap beyond local success, it would be now, with a solid lineup and a flawless batch of material. But there was another snag—or rather, two. Pelham learned his wife was pregnant, and he found himself the sole breadwinner of the family. 2001 brought an EP and a set of twin daughters. Recorded with local analog loyalist Brian Carter, the self-released The Beginning is a five-song tribute to impending fatherhood that shows the band alternately tender and fierce. But with newborns, extensive touring was suddenly impossible without substantial income for the band. Still, the songs cut through, and the EP was picked up two years later by UK label Fierce Panda, who had released singles from acts like Coldplay and Death Cab for Cutie. With that leverage, Daigle and Meeks began shopping it along with a three-song demo, which included the song “Blow It Out,” to various majors like Island, Atlantic, Warner Brothers and Universal. “We felt they were a major-label band,” says Meeks. “If they were at the right label, they could be successful at that level.” Universal bit. The A&R representative, Jolene Cherry, a former film music supervisor and head of the Cherry/Universal imprint, loved the band’s sound and worked up a one-year, two-option deal. That meant the band would release one record, giving the label the option to release the next two albums if they liked them, or release them from the terms if they didn’t. Along with the deal came an advance—six figures, according to Meeks—that gave the group enough money to make a record, tour and live for a year without day jobs. Out of all the labels they’d talked to, Universal seemed the most enthusiastic. “It came down to the excitement of the A&R person—her excitement for the band,” Pelham says. “She seemed to really have a genuine enthusiasm for what we were doing. But even with Universal, we wondered if it was the right thing for us, because they were mainly pop. They didn’t really have any rock records at the time.” Exhibit A was released on Sept. 14, 2004, in the States, the previous April in the UK. It’s a stunning 33-minute album that buzzes with addictive hooks and fervent pop gospel, and everything you’d expect from a debut that, in many ways, was some 10 years in the making. Search for press on the record, and you’ll have to dig just to find a lukewarm review. (One reviewer, referring to the lyrics of the single “Blow It Out,” remarks: “Ridiculous, expect it to be stuck in your head for days.”) But the album’s release was an early sign that the label wasn’t promoting the band as it should have been. “Before the record came out, there was pretty much no press and no publicity,” Pelham says. “But six months after the record came out, that’s when a press team really started working for us. And by that time, anyone at press had either already heard of us or said, ‘Well, this record’s been out for six months. It’s too late for us to write about it.’ It fell apart.” Though the label paid generously for the group to tour the UK a handful of times, most notably on a few runs with Kings of Leon, even those shows weren’t promoted. “We got really lucky with the Kings asking us out on the road,” Haas says. “But once again it seemed like the ducks weren’t in a row,” adds Pelham. “We would get there and there wouldn’t be promotion. It was really odd. The last tour we did with Kings of Leon—we heard at one point it was the biggest tour of the summer in the UK. We were the opening act for the biggest tour of the summer in the UK, and there was absolutely no press, no posters in the venues saying, ‘The Features, Exhibit A, Buy it now.’ ” The band received modest exposure for the track “Blow It Out,” notably a two-week run on CBS—but it wasn’t Universal who pushed the track to television. The <span class=""caps"">CBS</span> hookup was more serendipitous. An ad agency had heard the band and contacted them directly about using the song. The Features might have been more excited about potential exposure for their single, had they not been concerned with making a second record, which the label had already optioned. They’d sent demos to Cherry for consideration, with the answer that they should keep working on them. “The main time it started to go sour for me was when we were working on songs for the second record,” says Haas, who is the antithesis of Pelham’s quiet, reserved manner. He has a smiling, boyish face and speaks quickly with animated gesturing. “And it was the kind of thing where we were working very hard at it. Practicing a lot, trying to piece songs together and send them to our A&R person. Every time it was like, ‘No, this isn’t cutting it.’ That started to shake the confidence of the band.” Just as the deal with Spongebath left the band feeling like an afterthought, so did the deal with Universal. The record wasn’t selling well by industry standards—just over 12,000 copies in all were sold in the U.S., with UK sales thought to match that amount—and the single wasn’t getting the airplay the band or the label had hoped for. “The things I remember hearing were, ‘People at radio like it, but it doesn’t fit with what’s going on right now,’ ” Pelham says. “The Kaiser Chiefs had just been signed to Universal in the States, and their single ‘I Predict a Riot’ came out to radio when ‘Blow It Out’ did, and they said, ‘This is what’s big.’ I think all focus, if there was any focus on The Features, always seemed to get pushed to the backburner for something else—for another band. And that’s the way it is on a major. It’s sort of just priority. Just like on most labels.” With an ill-promoted record not exploding on radio, the label did what labels do. It sought to recoup its investment, and looked for a last-ditch effort to salvage the band’s career. All the band needed to do was cover a Beatles song for a Chase Credit Card commercial, put it on their second record and release it as a single. And not just any old Beatles song—one of the top Beatles songs of all time, used for the first worldwide televised broadcast in 1967: “All You Need Is Love.” It’s worth noting that The Beatles got their start playing covers. But all you need is love…and a 23-percent <span class=""caps"">APR</span>? It’s one of the least-covered Beatles songs due to its revered status, a flower-power anthem that espouses utopian ideals and astonishing optimism.

The band might not have shut down the message board on their site if the discussions of what the band should or shouldn’t have done hadn’t grown so heated.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/court-yard-hounds","Court Yard Hounds","","","Strictly speaking, it’s only a few feet from stage left or stage right to the center spotlight. But it took Martie Maguire and Emily Robison a couple of decades to move those couple of yards. As the mainstays of the Dixie Chicks since they formed the group in 1989, the sisters have been familiar faces to many millions of fans, yet just a little mysterious in that familiarity, content as they were to cede the lead vocalist position and remain music’s most recognizable “sidewomen.” Chicks fans couldn’t help but hear those ever-present harmonies and wonder if Emily and Martie might ever come out from hiding in plain sight. That’s just what they’ve done in their newly hatched incarnation as Court Yard Hounds, with a gorgeously assured debut album that has the siblings sounding like they’ve been fearless frontwomen all their lives. Is this band a side project? They can live with that label. Or something permanent? Yes, that, too. Robison and Maguire could no sooner take an indefinite vacation from music than they could from being related. So as the mother band’s hiatus grew into a longer vacation than anyone originally anticipated, “dormant” began to equal “torment” for these two working musicians. The Dixie Chicks were last seen triumphing at the Grammys in early 2007, winning the exceedingly rare trifecta of album, record, and song of the year for Taking the Long Way and its flagship single “Not Ready to Make Nice.” Something else they weren’t ready to do was make records or tour again, at least for a long while, as it turned out. All three Chicks enjoyed family time away from the media glare—but after a while Maguire and Robison felt refreshed and rarin’ to go, which still left them one singer short of a quorum. The usually bold Maines’ reticence to put herself through the grind again had the effect of pushing her slightly shyer bandmates out of the nest. “When Natalie first wanted to take a break,” says Maguire, “I remember this real fear in me, like: When are we getting back on the road? This is what I know! What will I do? I don’t have a college degree!” she recalls, laughing. Happily, rather than take night classes, they decided to school themselves in how to launch a new band. The Chicks haven’t disbanded, but Court Yard Hounds is no mere time-marker of a project. “Sony’s looking at this like an artist launch, and we’re looking at it like a new chapter in music,” Maguire avows. “We definitely are going to tour this and make another record. I know this isn’t just a one-time, get-it-off-our-chests, get-these-songs-recorded-and-go-back-to-our-lives thing.” Although Maguire is the lead vocalist on her own solo composition, “Gracefully,” the remainder of the tracks feature Robison singing material that arose out of a profoundly transitional period in her professional and personal life. “The first year of our hiatus, I was getting very restless and needed to be creative for my own sanity,” says Robison. “And at the same time I was going through my divorce”—from Texas singer/songwriter Charlie Robison—“so it was very fertile ground for writing.” The personal material that Robison was penning pretty well dictated what kind of album they would make. To the extent that anyone even knew the sisters were working on a new project, there were rumors that it might be a back-to-roots album, since they spent their teen years together in a bluegrass band and carried over a certain amount of that influence to the Chicks’ country-rock. It’s not such a preposterous notion; even Maguire thought it might be fun to revert back to the string-band music of their youth. “I remember one early conversation we had, where I said to Emily, ‘Well, do you want to form a bluegrass band?’ I was excited about that, because I’d been in my studio, recording a bunch of fiddle tunes from my past. And Emily said, ‘No, not exactly. That’s not where my head is.’” They both laugh at exactly how far away from that Court Yard Hounds ended up being. “Even though we played bluegrass,” Maguire says, “we listened to way more rock, folk-rock, and alternative music, and of course singer/songwriter stuff. And now I hear a lot of Shawn Colvin in Emily’s writing and voice. Because she is my sister and she was going through what she was going through, a lot of these songs brought me to tears. To hear her sing and express herself this way is very vulnerable, I think, and very brave.” Fans know how much Maguire and Robison are willing to reveal through songwriting with their other band, from “You Were Mine,” a ballad about their parents’ divorce that appeared on the 12-times-platinum Wide Open Spaces, to “So Hard,” a song from Taking the Long Way that addressed the issues of infertility they both struggled with before having their respective children. But the frank emotions of the new album may still come as a surprise from a pair who were previously content to have someone else give voice to their deeper sentiments. Rather than start off with a barnburner of an opener, it was Maguire’s suggestion that listeners be eased into the album with the subdued “Skyline,” which describes the inspiration Robison found just gazing at the view of San Antonio from her loft during a dark time. The song opens with just an acoustic guitar and Robison at her most tender, before a few soft drum rolls and Maguire’s lulling fiddle lead the ballad from the bitter into the sweet. Things then kick into higher gear—but, tellingly, stay in Texas—with “The Coast,” a good-times anthem that contentedly celebrates neither the east nor west but the south coast. There’s also a Texas theme to “See You in the Spring,” Robison’s duet with Jakob Dylan, the wry tale of a star-crossed couple from the northernmost and southernmost parts of the country who find their biggest obstacle is accepting each other’s climate change. Faster-paced songs range from the self-doubting feminine levity of “Then Again” to the fiery outrage of “Ain’t No Son,” a rocker sung from the myopic point of view of an angry, unaccepting father. Romantic themes veer between the bitter and sweet: “Fairytale” speaks to romantic enchantment, while there’s no happily-ever-after in sight in the breakup songs “April’s Love” and “It Didn’t Make a Sound.” The initial impetus behind Robison’s writing was to contribute to a future Chicks project, but upon realizing that the group’s hiatus had no clear end in sight, she started trying to write for other artists and movie projects. One problem with that: The demos felt too deeply personal to give away—especially in light of the barrage of emails she would get from Maguire after each new demo, warning, “You better not pitch this or I’m going to kill you.” At last, the eureka moment: Although Robison had never considered singing lead before—not even in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, when the Chicks cycled through two other singers before finding Maines—there was a sudden acceptance of the fact that maybe the last 20 years of pure harmonizing could be taken to the next level. Yet egolessness had been so self-ingrained into Robison and Maguire that laying aside that humility still involved a process of discovery. In Texas roots circles, the sisters had been well-known since they were pre-teen prodigies. Spurred on by their musically supportive parents, who would drive them from festival to festival, Martie joined her first band, the Blue Night Express, at 12, and a couple years later, Emily signed on, when she was 10. For all the instrumental training they had, though, there were no such formal lessons when it came to their sisterly harmonizing, which came from observing a lot of acts they saw on the bluegrass circuit, and, most probably, from something in the blood. “There was always comfort in the power of numbers,” Maguire says. “Emily and I have that kind of personality where we’re happy to support and happy to not be the center of attention. I remember my mom dragging us into the living room to play for company. It’s a different story than you hear from a lot of lead singers, who say ‘Oh, I used to get up on the table when I was 2 and belt out songs!’ We were very reluctant, at a young age. So with this album it was nice to discover that we had this other side to us that came pretty easily. Every day our confidence grew.” Adds Robison: “It can be intimidating when you sing with someone with the power that Natalie has. Martie and I have always been harmony singers, so you take your place in the mix. It was a huge learning curve for both of us—because Martie sings lead on one song, too—to figure out what your voice is, after you’ve sung so long just trying to blend. It really takes a lot of work, and there’s still a lot of work to be done, playing live, to find that voice. But I felt like I could interpret the songs because they meant something to me. It wasn’t like I was just trying to just sing any song. It was something very personal.” After Robison worked on a good chunk of the material with guitarist Martin Strayer, they settled in with co-producer Jim Scott at Maguire’s studio in May 2009, coming back for a second and final round of recording in October. “It was amazingly quick compared to how long Chicks records usually take,” laughs Maguire. “I loved every song Emily had written. You can’t create a sound when you don’t have the songs.” There remained, though, a slight degree of uncertainty about whether this would be for public consumption: “We knew we would know if there was a record there. And if there wasn’t, we had confidence that we would be honest enough with ourselves to say, “That was a great exercise, but that’s not getting packaged.’” After it was clear that self-veto power wouldn’t be necessary, the last element to come into play was a band name. Court Yard Hounds came from a novel Robison was reading called City of Thieves, by David Benioff. There’s a fictional book-within-the-book called The Courtyard Hound, but Emily points out that the specific impetus was “a quote in there about how inspiration comes and goes. The idea is that there are seasons of talent, and that at some point it’s gonna leave you, so you have to make the most of it when you are inspired.” It’s not difficult to see why that thought took root, with Maguire and Robison not wanting to let their own gifts lay fallow for another year, or even month. It was a deliberate decision to fly under the media and rumor-mill radar while the recording was in process. “One reason I felt like we needed to not let the cat out of the bag too soon,” says Robison, “is that every time I would tell someone about the project, they’d say, ‘Well, who are you going to get as the lead singer?’ I would just kind of kick the dirt and go ‘Well… we’re gonna try our hand at it.’ Until you have the music and you can play it for people, it was hard to explain what we were trying to do. It was important for us to get the music done first so that we had that confidence.” As Dixie Chicks, Maguire and Robison have grown used to having their private lives and thoughts put up for public scrutiny. Some Court Yard Hounds listeners may be eager to put every lyric up to a magnifying glass… and it’s not necessarily a completely misguided impulse, given that the sisters have penned obviously deeply felt songs before, even when Natalie was singing them. It’s no secret that Robison’s divorce sparked a good part of the material, but the sisters do discourage anyone from reading the album as a diary. “Everyone from our manager to our publicist already thinks it’s completely autobiographical, that everything’s so true and personal,” says Robison. “And it IS personal. But not everything is my life, even though people are gonna think it is. It’s better just to say that maybe 70% of it’s true, but I’m not gonna tell you which parts.” She laughs. “Keep ‘em guessing!” How to classify Court Yard Hounds on the career spectrum? Baby band? Superstar vanity project? It’s neither, but Maguire and Robison admit it’s tough to determine exactly where they fit in as they scale down considerably from the arena level. “It’s like you’re a new band, yet you’re not,” Emily says. “So it’s trying to walk that line of, okay, we have certain standards for ourselves, but we don’t have the payroll yet to pay for this or that. It is exciting, being able to step back and really get in the trenches. It’s a lot of work, but at the same time, we’ve never really been afraid of proving ourselves and working hard. The only difference now from when we first started out is that we have families and it is important to keep that balance.” And, possibly, a balance with that certain other band, down the line. “I think the elephant in the room for people is always ‘Well, what’s going on with the Chicks?’ When that presents itself, we’ll figure out how to marry the two,” says Robison. “Natalie will be the first one to tell you that she’s very supportive; she just doesn’t want to be in the studio and going through the whole process right now. Martie and I love to work and create and be making something, so being off was difficult for us. Just to be able to fulfill that and not have to dismantle the Dixie Chicks—why can’t we do both? We’re going to push to make it a complete entity and have fun with it.” When fans see Maguire and Robison from now on, whether they’re at side or center stage, it’ll be with a greater sense of the individual personalities of the sisters who’ve seemed ubiquitous, yet just a little elusive for so many years. Their easy smiles and rapport with fans from the front rows to the rafters have gotten them pegged as “the friendly ones,” but the material on Court Yard Hounds proves them as complex as they are approachable. “People do want to figure out: which one are you?” says Robison, of their traditional personas in the Chicks. “Martie’s ‘the nice one that smiles,’ I’m ‘the quiet one,’ and Natalie’s ‘the feisty one.’ And when you shake things up and make them see you in a different light, it kind of confuses people. So truly, as much as the song ‘Then Again’ is about me never wanting to shake things up, with age, I’ve come to this point where I just don’t care what people think as much.” And not only was it worth the wait, this flowering simply had to wait. “I don’t think I could have done this five or ten years ago with Martie,” Emily affirms. “I would have been too timid, too shy, too ‘Oh no, I can’t do that.’ Now, I think, if some people don’t like it, that’s fine.” No lap dogs here: Court Yard Hounds are ready to get out and work it. “Even if we have just 10 percent of the people who reacted to us before, or only new fans, whatever it is…we can make something of that.”","<p>Strictly speaking, it’s only a few feet from stage left or stage right to the center spotlight. But it took Martie Maguire and Emily Robison a couple of decades to move those couple of yards. As the mainstays of the Dixie Chicks since they formed the group in 1989, the sisters have been familiar faces to many millions of fans, yet just a little mysterious in that familiarity, content as they were to cede the lead vocalist position and remain music’s most recognizable “sidewomen.” Chicks fans couldn’t help but hear those ever-present harmonies and wonder if Emily and Martie might ever come out from hiding in plain sight.<br /> <br><br> That’s just what they’ve done in their newly hatched incarnation as Court Yard Hounds, with a gorgeously assured debut album that has the siblings sounding like they’ve been fearless frontwomen all their lives. Is this band a side project? They can live with that label. Or something permanent? Yes, that, too.<br /> <br><br> Robison and Maguire could no sooner take an indefinite vacation from music than they could from being related. So as the mother band’s hiatus grew into a longer vacation than anyone originally anticipated, “dormant” began to equal “torment” for these two working musicians. The Dixie Chicks were last seen triumphing at the Grammys in early 2007, winning the exceedingly rare trifecta of album, record, and song of the year for Taking the Long Way and its flagship single “Not Ready to Make Nice.” Something else they weren’t ready to do was make records or tour again, at least for a long while, as it turned out. All three Chicks enjoyed family time away from the media glare—but after a while Maguire and Robison felt refreshed and rarin’ to go, which still left them one singer short of a quorum. The usually bold Maines’ reticence to put herself through the grind again had the effect of pushing her slightly shyer bandmates out of the nest.<br /> <br><br> “When Natalie first wanted to take a break,” says Maguire, “I remember this real fear in me, like: When are we getting back on the road? This is what I know! What will I do? I don’t have a college degree!” she recalls, laughing. Happily, rather than take night classes, they decided to school themselves in how to launch a new band. The Chicks haven’t disbanded, but Court Yard Hounds is no mere time-marker of a project. “Sony’s looking at this like an artist launch, and we’re looking at it like a new chapter in music,” Maguire avows. “We definitely are going to tour this and make another record. I know this isn’t just a one-time, get-it-off-our-chests, get-these-songs-recorded-and-go-back-to-our-lives thing.”<br /> <br><br> Although Maguire is the lead vocalist on her own solo composition, “Gracefully,” the remainder of the tracks feature Robison singing material that arose out of a profoundly transitional period in her professional and personal life. “The first year of our hiatus, I was getting very restless and needed to be creative for my own sanity,” says Robison. “And at the same time I was going through my divorce”—from Texas singer/songwriter Charlie Robison—“so it was very fertile ground for writing.” <br /> <br><br> The personal material that Robison was penning pretty well dictated what kind of album they would make. To the extent that anyone even knew the sisters were working on a new project, there were rumors that it might be a back-to-roots album, since they spent their teen years together in a bluegrass band and carried over a certain amount of that influence to the Chicks’ country-rock. It’s not such a preposterous notion; even Maguire thought it might be fun to revert back to the string-band music of their youth. “I remember one early conversation we had, where I said to Emily, ‘Well, do you want to form a bluegrass band?’ I was excited about that, because I’d been in my studio, recording a bunch of fiddle tunes from my past. And Emily said, ‘No, not exactly. That’s not where my head is.’” They both laugh at exactly how far away from that Court Yard Hounds ended up being. <br /> <br><br> “Even though we played bluegrass,” Maguire says, “we listened to way more rock, folk-rock, and alternative music, and of course singer/songwriter stuff. And now I hear a lot of Shawn Colvin in Emily’s writing and voice. Because she is my sister and she was going through what she was going through, a lot of these songs brought me to tears. To hear her sing and express herself this way is very vulnerable, I think, and very brave.”<br /> <br><br> Fans know how much Maguire and Robison are willing to reveal through songwriting with their other band, from “You Were Mine,” a ballad about their parents’ divorce that appeared on the 12-times-platinum Wide Open Spaces, to “So Hard,” a song from Taking the Long Way that addressed the issues of infertility they both struggled with before having their respective children. But the frank emotions of the new album may still come as a surprise from a pair who were previously content to have someone else give voice to their deeper sentiments.<br /> <br><br> Rather than start off with a barnburner of an opener, it was Maguire’s suggestion that listeners be eased into the album with the subdued “Skyline,” which describes the inspiration Robison found just gazing at the view of San Antonio from her loft during a dark time. The song opens with just an acoustic guitar and Robison at her most tender, before a few soft drum rolls and Maguire’s lulling fiddle lead the ballad from the bitter into the sweet. Things then kick into higher gear—but, tellingly, stay in Texas—with “The Coast,” a good-times anthem that contentedly celebrates neither the east nor west but the south coast. There’s also a Texas theme to “See You in the Spring,” Robison’s duet with Jakob Dylan, the wry tale of a star-crossed couple from the northernmost and southernmost parts of the country who find their biggest obstacle is accepting each other’s climate change. Faster-paced songs range from the self-doubting feminine levity of “Then Again” to the fiery outrage of “Ain’t No Son,” a rocker sung from the myopic point of view of an angry, unaccepting father. Romantic themes veer between the bitter and sweet: “Fairytale” speaks to romantic enchantment, while there’s no happily-ever-after in sight in the breakup songs “April’s Love” and “It Didn’t Make a Sound.”<br /> <br><br> The initial impetus behind Robison’s writing was to contribute to a future Chicks project, but upon realizing that the group’s hiatus had no clear end in sight, she started trying to write for other artists and movie projects. One problem with that: The demos felt too deeply personal to give away—especially in light of the barrage of emails she would get from Maguire after each new demo, warning, “You better not pitch this or I’m going to kill you.”<br /> <br><br> At last, the eureka moment: Although Robison had never considered singing lead before—not even in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, when the Chicks cycled through two other singers before finding Maines—there was a sudden acceptance of the fact that maybe the last 20 years of pure harmonizing could be taken to the next level. Yet egolessness had been so self-ingrained into Robison and Maguire that laying aside that humility still involved a process of discovery.<br /> <br><br> In Texas roots circles, the sisters had been well-known since they were pre-teen prodigies. Spurred on by their musically supportive parents, who would drive them from festival to festival, Martie joined her first band, the Blue Night Express, at 12, and a couple years later, Emily signed on, when she was 10. For all the instrumental training they had, though, there were no such formal lessons when it came to their sisterly harmonizing, which came from observing a lot of acts they saw on the bluegrass circuit, and, most probably, from something in the blood. <br /> <br><br> “There was always comfort in the power of numbers,” Maguire says. “Emily and I have that kind of personality where we’re happy to support and happy to not be the center of attention.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/family-of-the-year","Family of the Year","Silverlake, California","folk, indie pop, indie folk","Most bands function like a family, seeing how touring, writing, and studio time force them to share a lot of small spaces for extended periods of time. But Family of the Year has taken that familial feeling a step further, and not just with its moniker. The members of the Los Angeles outfit have formed unbreakable bonds amongst themselves that come from cohabitating in a run-down house and relying on each other for inspiration and support, which has led to the kind of camaraderie that allows members to finish each other’s sentences. It also doesn’t hurt that frontman Joe Keefe and drummer Sebastian Keefe are real-life siblings. Not surprisingly, many of the group’s songs feature numerous voices, and more than a few include a chorus of joyous handclaps. Some even sound like they should be sung by the tight-knit group around the campfire while the s’mores are melting and the wine is flowing, especially the ones that name-drop members of the band. Guitarist Jamesy Buckey, in particular, has received the lion’s share of shout-outs in FOTY songs, to the point where it’s become a Family tradition. Family of the Year’s story began in 2009, when Joe assembled a band around an album, Songbook, that he completed while decompressing from a five-year stint with Unbusted, the alt-rock trio he started in Boston with Sebastian that gained some notoriety for its inclusion on the soundtrack to the Farrelly brothers’ film Stuck On You. Instead of relying on the distortion of his past, suddenly pianos, horns, acoustic guitars, and other assorted instrumentation were being used to display a more sophisticated—yet equally as playful—indie-rock sound that brings to mind classic pop bands like The Smiths, The Byrds, Fleetwood Mac, and The Go-Betweens. To say that Family of the Year has accomplished a lot in a short amount of time would be an understatement. In addition to Songbook, the band has issued a pair of EPs on its own Washashore Records imprint – 2009’s Where’s The Sun, 2010’s Through The Trees – in addition to last year’s 2011’s St. Croix. Songs from all four discs have made their way onto various international releases. Media attention has come from various corners of the world, including heavy rotation on French radio as well as glowing reviews from NME, BBC, IFC, Rolling Stone and Spin. Now the group is preparing for its busiest schedule yet, with shows and tours being planned around the forthcoming full-length Loma Vista, which is due July 10, 2012 on Nettwerk Records. In addition to plenty of stateside dates, the Family plans to return overseas, where it has already developed a significant fanbase. In 2011, the band played sold-out shows in England and across Europe, including a triumphant set at France’s largest music festival, Les Vieilles Charrues. The list of artists that FOTY has played with over the years is notable, including Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros (who took the band on tour early in its career), Mumford & Sons, Gomez, Good Old War, Belle Brigade and The Antlers, though arguably the most impressive opening gig so far was when the band warmed up a Ben Folds performance with the Boston Pops Orchestra. Handpicked by Folds and Boston Pops conductor Keith Lockhart, Family of the Year beat out 700 other hopeful artists to open the Oct. 2009 event. Not a bad way to spend your third show ever. “We went back home to Boston to play at Symphony Hall, which was the sweetest homecoming ever,” says Joe. “The show was amazing. Our mom got to stay at a nice hotel and get dressed up and come see us play. Musically we were a bit shaky, it being our third gig, but it was a great room to play in.” Proving its versatility, the Family has made fans of a couple of fellow Massachusetts-bred musicians who, on the surface at least, don’t have much in common: singer-songwriter Willy Mason and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. Mason contributed to the reggae-tinged “The Princess And The Pea” on Through The Trees, while the demon of screamin’ discovered Family of the Year through a mutual connection and compared what he heard to “The Mamas And The Papas on acid.” Interestingly enough, the Keefe brothers used to live next to the apartment in Boston that once housed Aerosmith. “I don’t think Steven Tyler is getting a tattoo anytime soon, but he likes our music,” says Sebastian. “We had the opportunity to meet him once, and he was really cool.” But a band is only as good as its most recent output, which is why it’s fair to say that Family of the Year has positioned itself for greatness. Recorded by what now constitutes the core of FOTY—Joe (vocals, guitar), Sebastian (drums, vocals), Buckey (guitar, vocals), and Christina Schroeter (keyboards, vocals)—the group completed 14 songs with producer Wally Gagel at his new studio in Hollywood, 10 of which made it onto Loma Vista. This is the first time that the band has worked with a producer and gone outside their own camp to release their music. With Gagel’s assistance, the band has crafted a stirring set of songs teeming with catchy melodies, clever ruminations on love, heartbreak, and staying up late enough to watch the sun rise, and a cosmopolitan flavor enhanced by the fact that the members of Family of the Year hail from all over the globe. After being born in Martha’s Vineyard, the Keefe brothers followed their father’s bloodline back to Wales during their formative years (during which time Britpop was booming); Buckey is from Jacksonville, Florida, where he familiarized himself with that town’s all-ages punk scene; and Schroeter is the lone Southern California native, having grown up in Huntington Beach, where she inevitably became enamored with the ska scene led by No Doubt. Though still only in their 20s, the members of this Family are music veterans, and the precision with which they play is a testament to all of the hard work that got them here. Gagel is another Boston native, having played with ’90s power trio Orbit prior to his current status as half of the hit-making production duo Wax Ltd (he and Xandy Barry have collectively and individually worked with artists like Folk Implosion, Muse, New Order, and The Rolling Stones). Joe had already developed strong ties with Gagel before the band entered the studio. “Having him be a really close friend instead of a random producer assigned to us was really helpful, because you have to be pushed to edit yourself and be better, be stronger, work harder on things,” says Joe. “Working with someone like that who knows exactly what we wanted it to sound like with the same exact vision, it was really kind of a no-brainer.” As a collection, the album is a lively slice of indie, dance- and psych-rock. Most songs highlight the perennial backdrop of California sunbeams – “St. Croix” is a dreamy tune about “a boy from Florida / took a trip to the Caribbean … he came to get over her,” (and yes, it’s about Jamesy), the strummy, 5-part harmonic “Stairs” and propulsive keyboard-laden “Diversity” are lovely servings of the band’s signature exuberance. But, don’t be misguided in thinking the band is only about cheerful, jangly tunes. Family Of The Year opens the album up to down-tempo tracks that ache a little and leave sepia-filtered images in your mind – e.g. “Hero” and “Hey Ma.” “It feels like the first time in so many ways, because it’s the first time things have really clicked,” says Joe. “We inspire each other,” says Sebastian. “It was important for this record to be something that would stand up as one piece, rather than something that sounded like songs strung together. We really wanted to have a record with a clear identity.” And Family of the Year’s future is clearly a bright one. Playing every show like it’s a special occasional and writing each song with complete conviction has allowed the band to accomplish everything it has set its sights on. As “Living On Love” notes, “they say that you can’t get every little thing that you want … it’s such a lie.”","<p>Most bands function like a family, seeing how touring, writing, and studio time force them to share a lot of small spaces for extended periods of time.

Guitarist Jamesy Buckey, in particular, has received the lion’s share of shout-outs in <span class=""caps"">FOTY</span> songs, to the point where it’s become a Family tradition.<br /> <br><br> Family of the Year’s story began in 2009, when Joe assembled a band around an album, Songbook, that he completed while decompressing from a five-year stint with Unbusted, the alt-rock trio he started in Boston with Sebastian that gained some notoriety for its inclusion on the soundtrack to the Farrelly brothers’ film Stuck On You. Instead of relying on the distortion of his past, suddenly pianos, horns, acoustic guitars, and other assorted instrumentation were being used to display a more sophisticated—yet equally as playful—indie-rock sound that brings to mind classic pop bands like The Smiths, The Byrds, Fleetwood Mac, and The Go-Betweens.<br /> <br><br> To say that Family of the Year has accomplished a lot in a short amount of time would be an understatement. In addition to Songbook, the band has issued a pair of EPs on its own Washashore Records imprint – 2009’s Where’s The Sun, 2010’s Through The Trees – in addition to last year’s 2011’s St. Croix. Songs from all four discs have made their way onto various international releases. Media attention has come from various corners of the world, including heavy rotation on French radio as well as glowing reviews from <span class=""caps"">NME</span>, <span class=""caps"">BBC</span>, <span class=""caps"">IFC</span>, Rolling Stone and Spin. <br /> <br><br> Now the group is preparing for its busiest schedule yet, with shows and tours being planned around the forthcoming full-length Loma Vista, which is due July 10, 2012 on Nettwerk Records. In addition to plenty of stateside dates, the Family plans to return overseas, where it has already developed a significant fanbase. In 2011, the band played sold-out shows in England and across Europe, including a triumphant set at France’s largest music festival, Les Vieilles Charrues.<br /> <br><br> The list of artists that <span class=""caps"">FOTY</span> has played with over the years is notable, including Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros (who took the band on tour early in its career), Mumford & Sons, Gomez, Good Old War, Belle Brigade and The Antlers, though arguably the most impressive opening gig so far was when the band warmed up a Ben Folds performance with the Boston Pops Orchestra. Handpicked by Folds and Boston Pops conductor Keith Lockhart, Family of the Year beat out 700 other hopeful artists to open the Oct. 2009 event. Not a bad way to spend your third show ever.<br /> <br><br> “We went back home to Boston to play at Symphony Hall, which was the sweetest homecoming ever,” says Joe. “The show was amazing. Our mom got to stay at a nice hotel and get dressed up and come see us play. Musically we were a bit shaky, it being our third gig, but it was a great room to play in.”<br /> <br><br> Proving its versatility, the Family has made fans of a couple of fellow Massachusetts-bred musicians who, on the surface at least, don’t have much in common: singer-songwriter Willy Mason and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. Mason contributed to the reggae-tinged “The Princess And The Pea” on Through The Trees, while the demon of screamin’ discovered Family of the Year through a mutual connection and compared what he heard to “The Mamas And The Papas on acid.” Interestingly enough, the Keefe brothers used to live next to the apartment in Boston that once housed Aerosmith.<br /> <br><br> “I don’t think Steven Tyler is getting a tattoo anytime soon, but he likes our music,” says Sebastian. “We had the opportunity to meet him once, and he was really cool.”<br /> <br><br> But a band is only as good as its most recent output, which is why it’s fair to say that Family of the Year has positioned itself for greatness. Recorded by what now constitutes the core of FOTY—Joe (vocals, guitar), Sebastian (drums, vocals), Buckey (guitar, vocals), and Christina Schroeter (keyboards, vocals)—the group completed 14 songs with producer Wally Gagel at his new studio in Hollywood, 10 of which made it onto Loma Vista. This is the first time that the band has worked with a producer and gone outside their own camp to release their music.<br /> <br><br> With Gagel’s assistance, the band has crafted a stirring set of songs teeming with catchy melodies, clever ruminations on love, heartbreak, and staying up late enough to watch the sun rise, and a cosmopolitan flavor enhanced by the fact that the members of Family of the Year hail from all over the globe. After being born in Martha’s Vineyard, the Keefe brothers followed their father’s bloodline back to Wales during their formative years (during which time Britpop was booming); Buckey is from Jacksonville, Florida, where he familiarized himself with that town’s all-ages punk scene; and Schroeter is the lone Southern California native, having grown up in Huntington Beach, where she inevitably became enamored with the ska scene led by No Doubt. Though still only in their 20s, the members of this Family are music veterans, and the precision with which they play is a testament to all of the hard work that got them here.<br /> <br><br> Gagel is another Boston native, having played with ’90s power trio Orbit prior to his current status as half of the hit-making production duo Wax Ltd (he and Xandy Barry have collectively and individually worked with artists like Folk Implosion, Muse, New Order, and The Rolling Stones). Joe had already developed strong ties with Gagel before the band entered the studio.<br /> <br><br> “Having him be a really close friend instead of a random producer assigned to us was really helpful, because you have to be pushed to edit yourself and be better, be stronger, work harder on things,” says Joe. “Working with someone like that who knows exactly what we wanted it to sound like with the same exact vision, it was really kind of a no-brainer.”<br /> <br><br> As a collection, the album is a lively slice of indie, dance- and psych-rock. Most songs highlight the perennial backdrop of California sunbeams – “St. Croix” is a dreamy tune about “a boy from Florida / took a trip to the Caribbean … he came to get over her,” (and yes, it’s about Jamesy), the strummy, 5-part harmonic “Stairs” and propulsive keyboard-laden “Diversity” are lovely servings of the band’s signature exuberance. But, don’t be misguided in thinking the band is only about cheerful, jangly tunes. Family Of The Year opens the album up to down-tempo tracks that ache a little and leave sepia-filtered images in your mind – e.g. “Hero” and “Hey Ma.”<br /> <br><br> “It feels like the first time in so many ways, because it’s the first time things have really clicked,” says Joe.<br /> <br><br> “We inspire each other,” says Sebastian. “It was important for this record to be something that would stand up as one piece, rather than something that sounded like songs strung together. We really wanted to have a record with a clear identity.”<br /> <br><br> And Family of the Year’s future is clearly a bright one. Playing every show like it’s a special occasional and writing each song with complete conviction has allowed the band to accomplish everything it has set its sights on. As “Living On Love” notes, “they say that you can’t get every little thing that you want … it’s such a lie.”</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/6519084/Family_Of_The_Year_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/Fynl_6Havpw?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

Ozomatli’s second album, Embrace the Chaos, was released on the inauspicious date of September 11, 2001. Although many American bands cancelled their concerts, Ozomatli gained some recognition for continuing to play their concerts, all the while continuing their commitment to social justice and progressive politics, in addition to the rising anti-war movement.

Already renowned across Canada thanks to the success of his previous two full length albums – 2005’s Sometimes and 2008’s Bring Me Your Love – and a live CD/DVD combo released between the two, Green is set to propel his profile to a new plateau with the June 2011 release of his third album, Little Hell. When he’s not foiling the intense and aggressive post-hardcore sounds of Alexisonfire with his dreamy, dulcet vocals, Green can be found touring as City and Colour, selling out thousand-seat venues across his native North America and respectably-sized European shows weeks in advance, including an April 2011 performance at the UK’s treasured Royal Albert Hall which sold out in mere hours. Considering his already impressive album sales, his latest album’s potential impact is enormous.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-virginmarys","The Virginmarys","","","Satellite towns tend to breed big ambitions. Perched on the hills above Manchester, Macclesfield’s principle claim to fame comes in the cult of Ian Curtis. That classic example of the ‘just out of the city’ boy reinforces how big horizons tend to breed big ambitions. The Virginmarys are not part of the Curtis club. Their music blends the dynamics of platinum class ‘grunge’ (basically Nirvana, Mudhoney and Screaming Trees) with the spikiness of punk and the attention to detail and honesty of prime British rock of the early 1970’s, before the wizards and capes overcame the attack and dynamic. Their belief system begins with a devotion to the idea of playing. Live or in rehearsals, the three are at their most comfortable instruments in hand. Whether this is cool or not in a world where we sometimes seem to want our bands to devote themselves to studiously not playing is of no consequence to them. So, the debut album, ‘King Of Conflict’, was recorded live in the studio with Toby Jepson producing and Chris Sheldon (Pixies, Foo Fighters, Biffy Clyro, etc) at the mixing controls to capture the band at their thrilling best. But this is not ‘muso’ territory. Whilst Ally may have learnt his playing via a local blues maestro and lived in a house sound tracked by the likes of Fleetwood Mac, Free and The Allman Bros courtesy of his dad, the revelation of Nirvana and the digging backwards to punk and forwards to the diverse likes of Elbow and Arcade Fire meant that when Ally, Matt and Danny set out to write rock songs, those were never likely to be dumb, despite being a hell of a lot of fun. Further, Ally’s nature and his position as lyricist pretty much guaranteed that The Virginmarys would share much in common with those bands who eschewed the brainless cartoons of metal to create a rock music that used its words to deal with real life, real feelings and serious subjects. So a typical song from the trio rocks as hard as anything you are likely to hear but can talk about making the wrong calls despite yourself (‘Dead Man’s Shoes), domestic violence from the less thought out position of male as victim (‘Portrait Of Red’) and anti-capitalism (‘You’ve Got Your Money’). It’s that blend of rock schooling and intelligence that makes The Virginmarys such a thrilling proposition. Unlike so many contemporaries, the three are unlikely to fall into any of the obvious traps that bedevil young bands in their world. Having spent three years touring and playing alongside a series of self-released EP’s the band have built a fan base that encompasses the likes of Slash (a regular VM’s T shirt wearer), We Are Scientists, Eagles Of Death Metal and Ash, all of whom have invited the band to support them and thousands of devoted fans across the globe. In the process they have featured on BBC Breakfast, scored an iTunes single of the week both in the UK and US, had a track featured on Rockband 3 and sold out London’s Garage at a canter as part of HMV’s Next Big Thing series of shows at the close of 2011. Those beginnings have fostered a band that are ambitious without being arrogant, Ally claims that honesty is at the heart of everything he does, Danny wants The Virginmarys to be a catalyst for new bands to form and create great new music and Matt sees success as blowing away the dross that currently populates daytime radio and creating a world in which their music, and that like it, makes the music world an exciting place to be once more. In a world crying out for a band with substance, The Virginmarys could well prove to be the answer to all our prayers.","<p>Satellite towns tend to breed big ambitions.

So a typical song from the trio rocks as hard as anything you are likely to hear but can talk about making the wrong calls despite yourself (‘Dead Man’s Shoes), domestic violence from the less thought out position of male as victim (‘Portrait Of Red’) and anti-capitalism (‘You’ve Got Your Money’).</p> <p>It’s that blend of rock schooling and intelligence that makes The Virginmarys such a thrilling proposition. Unlike so many contemporaries, the three are unlikely to fall into any of the obvious traps that bedevil young bands in their world. Having spent three years touring and playing alongside a series of self-released EP’s the band have built a fan base that encompasses the likes of Slash (a regular VM’s T shirt wearer), We Are Scientists, Eagles Of Death Metal and Ash, all of whom have invited the band to support them and thousands of devoted fans across the globe. In the process they have featured on <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">BBC</span></span> Breakfast, scored an iTunes single of the week both in the UK and US, had a track featured on Rockband 3 and sold out London’s Garage at a canter as part of <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">HMV</span></span>’s Next Big Thing series of shows at the close of 2011.</p> <p>Those beginnings have fostered a band that are ambitious without being arrogant, Ally claims that honesty is at the heart of everything he does, Danny wants The Virginmarys to be a catalyst for new bands to form and create great new music and Matt sees success as blowing away the dross that currently populates daytime radio and creating a world in which their music, and that like it, makes the music world an exciting place to be once more.</p> <p>In a world crying out for a band with substance, The Virginmarys could well prove to be the answer to all our prayers.</p> </div>","http://cdn0.dostuffmedia.com/themes/metro_shell_v1/images/icons/logo_177.gif?1362420237","http://www.youtube.com/e/7SwRIiR-M_o?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/robyn-hitchcock","Robyn Hitchcock","London, UK","indie, singer-songwriter, alternative","Robyn Raymond Hitchcock (born March 3, 1953) is an English singer-songwriter and psych folk guitarist who also ventures into several forms of art, in particular painting and poetry, and has occasionally shown an interest in acting. While primarily a vocalist and guitarist, he also plays harmonica, piano and bass guitar. Many of Hitchcock’s album covers bear his paintings or drawings, and his albums’ liner notes sometimes include a printed short story. His live concerts usually include a considerable amount of story-telling, imaginative and surreal ad-libbed monologues in his lyrical style. Robyn is the son of novelist Raymond Hitchcock and the brother of artist Lal Hitchcock. He is not related to Alfred Hitchcock. Robyn is not possessed by demons, not really. He regularly does solo work, and returns again and again to bands he has formed like The Soft Boys and The Egyptians. Hitchcock is an avid and able collaborator with folks like director Jonathan Demme, actor Alan Rickman, country/folk duo (and longtime Hitchcock fans) Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, The Venus 3, R.E.M.‘s Peter Buck, Young Fresh Fellows’ frontman Scott McCaughey, Andy Partridge of XTC, Nick Lowe, former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, Jon Brion and Grant-Lee Phillips, as well as Ministry‘s Bill Rieflin. Hitchcock’s musical and lyrical styles have been influenced by his appreciation of Bob Dylan, Gregory Corso, The Byrds, Country Joe & the Fish, and Syd Barrett. Hitchcock’s lyrics are an essential component of his work and tend to include surrealism, comedic songs, characterizations of English eccentrics, plant roots, insects, trains, dreams, and melancholy depictions of everyday life. His themes include what many psychologists view as the roots of modern neurosis – namely, death, sex and eating. (As if in recognition of these themes, he released an EP in 2007 called ""Sex, Food, Death and Tarantulas"".) His fearless, wry, jovial, and nuanced approach to subjects that others avoid gives a depth and a refreshing playful thoughtfulness to his work. Often those who come to his well-crafted songs enjoy their stay, then leave with their humanity reaffirmed and their preconceptions satisfyingly loosened. Listen at Last.fm.. Sex, Food, Death and Tarantulas is the new EP from Robyn Hitchcock, the auteur of the highly-acclaimed album Ole! Tarantula, contains six live unreleased tracks including the Soft Boys classic, ""Give It to the Soft Boys,"" Hitchcock solo gems like ""Sometimes a Blonde,"" and the Venus 3's ""(A Man's Got to Know His Limitations )Briggs."" Also included is two videos for ""Adventure Rocketship"" from Ole! Tarantula – one live action video and a wistful stop motion animation rendering. In addition to the these extras overflowing from the Ole! Tarantula sessions and tour, keep an eye out for a documentary profiling the psych-popster to air on the Sundance channel which will debut at the SXSW film festival.

Sometimes, you just need a little shake-up to get things to how they always ought to have been. With Heat Sin Water Skin, BettySoo adds some welcome edge and grit we always knew she had to the heartbreaker ballads and bell-pure vocals she’s come to be known for. Teamed with seasoned producer Gurf Morlix (Lucinda Williams, Mary Gauthier, Slaid Cleaves), BettySoo has made a record worth sitting up and paying attention to. Her vocals are striking, the players are strong, the sound is compelling, and her writing is better than ever. Her first two studio albums (Let Me Love You, 2005; Little Tiny Secrets, 2007) and EP (Never the Pretty Girl, 2007) were well received by critics, earning praise locally and nationally- even securing her some performance opportunities overseas. And she’s not slowing down any time soon. Since their release, she has earned multiple songwriting awards (including Kerrville New Folk, Wildflower Festival, and Big Top Chautauqua Songwriter of the Year) and has proven herself a strong emerging performer as well. Joining her on Heat Sin Water Skin are Todd Wilson on organ, Gene Elders on fiddle, and Dave Terry on drums. BettySoo and Gurf handled the guitar and vocal parts themselves. As for genre, she’s still nestled in the folk-rock world, but she is bringing something new to her listeners. ""There’s a little gospel, some straight-ahead folk, and maybe even a familiar oldie with a new twist. Be ready for a surprise."" Then again, not much about BettySoo isn’t surprising. People are surprised just to see her take the stage. Plain-faced, petite (clocking in at exactly 5 foot), and freckly, people don’t have any idea what to expect- they certainly don’t expect such a large voice and moving songs. ""I guess Asian-American singer-songwriters aren’t all that common,"" she comments, ""at least, not in Texas."" In fact, she regularly gets greeted after her shows with praise comparing her music and vocals to everyone from Ruthie Foster to Sheryl Crow to Joan Baez. Then, of course, there’s the whole issue of her name. How did a second-generation Korean end up with such a classic southern name? Is it a stage name? ""No,"" she answers, laughing, ""I guess I’m just lucky that way. It’s right there on my birth certificate. Soo is my dad’s middle name, too. Yep, he’s a boy named Soo.""

MOJO magazine wrote “The band who must rate as England’s very own Uncle Tupelo. A truly thrilling collection.”, while www.americana-uk.com said “The British band that played alt. country before anyone knew what the hell it was. Had the Good Sons done this same thing across the Atlantic, they would surely have been acclaimed trailblazers.” For the past eight years he has been a solo troubadour, touring all over the world, performing with the likes of Nick Cave, John Cale, Roger McGuinn, Steve Earle, Guy Clark , Chris Hillman, Ron Sexsmith, Steve Forbert, Son Volt, and many more, and releasing five studio albums, 3 live albums and a career retrospective dvd, The Crowning Story, along the way. As fine a singer songwriter as Gram Parsons’ CHRIS HILLMAN Michael Weston King has a voice part Nashville balladeer and part Alt Country hero………a cross between Nick Cave and Rodney Crowell. THE INDEPENDENT Like Tim Hardin, Phil Ochs or Townes van Zandt, King transmutes squalor and self-laceration into pure gold. MOJO Many different artists have recorded his songs, while a number of his songs have also been used in TV shows in America and Germany. Beautiful Lies, a songbook of his work, was published in 2005, Happy Infidels, a play by the Irish writer Brian Richmond, was based around 12 of Michael’s songs, and he is currently working on a book about some of the greatest ‘lost’ songs of the past 40 years. A solo retrospective collection, The Tender Place, was released in November 2006, while his last studio album, A New Kind of Loneliness including contributions from Chris Hillman, Ron Sexsmith and Jackie Leven, was released in May 2007 to critical acclaim, and has been widely hailed as his best album to date; A powerful work of unblinking emotional seriousness. Entombed in gorgeously sepulchral tunes, the effect is quite magnificent. King is a special talent. The Word MWK has entered the rarefied field of classic singer songwriters. USA Entertainment News His latest album, Crawling Through The USA, recording live during his 2008 tour of N America, perfectly showcases the man alone, with just his guitar and songs for company. The album features Michaels stunning interpretation of the Townes Van Zandt song, Marie. The accompanying video perfectly captures the mood of the song, and has been nominated for awards in the UK. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3k-D4bQnQ Coming up are 2 new albums, both set for release in 2010. Later in the year will be the release of a pure country duets album, My Darling Clementine, made with his wife, the acclaimed singer Lou Dalgleish, and featuring the talents of Geraint Watkins, Martin Belmont, Bobby Irwin, and many other legendary British musicians. Before that, the new solo album, called “I Didn’t Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier” an album made up entirely of Protest songs. Some news ones, written specially, and some older ones that are still as relevant today as when they were first written, some going as far back as the 1920’s.

Had the Good Sons done this same thing across the Atlantic, they would surely have been acclaimed trailblazers.”</p> <p>For the past eight years he has been a solo troubadour, touring all over the world, performing with the likes of Nick Cave, John Cale, Roger McGuinn, Steve Earle, Guy Clark , Chris Hillman, Ron Sexsmith, Steve Forbert, Son Volt, and many more, and releasing five studio albums, 3 live albums and a career retrospective dvd, The Crowning Story, along the way.</p> <p>As fine a singer songwriter as Gram Parsons’ <span class=""caps"">CHRIS</span> <span class=""caps"">HILLMAN</span></p> <p>Michael Weston King has a voice part Nashville balladeer and part Alt Country hero………a cross between Nick Cave and Rodney Crowell. <span class=""caps"">THE</span> <span class=""caps"">INDEPENDENT</span></p> <p>Like Tim Hardin, Phil Ochs or Townes van Zandt, King transmutes squalor and self-laceration into pure gold. <span class=""caps"">MOJO</span></p> <p>Many different artists have recorded his songs, while a number of his songs have also been used in TV shows in America and Germany. Beautiful Lies, a songbook of his work, was published in 2005, Happy Infidels, a play by the Irish writer Brian Richmond, was based around 12 of Michael’s songs, and he is currently working on a book about some of the greatest ‘lost’ songs of the past 40 years.</p> <p>A solo retrospective collection, The Tender Place, was released in November 2006, while his last studio album, A New Kind of Loneliness including contributions from Chris Hillman, Ron Sexsmith and Jackie Leven, was released in May 2007 to critical acclaim, and has been widely hailed as his best album to date;</p> <p>A powerful work of unblinking emotional seriousness. Entombed in gorgeously sepulchral tunes, the effect is quite magnificent. King is a special talent. The Word</p> <p><span class=""caps"">MWK</span> has entered the rarefied field of classic singer songwriters. <span class=""caps"">USA</span> Entertainment News</p> <p>His latest album, Crawling Through The <span class=""caps"">USA</span>, recording live during his 2008 tour of N America, perfectly showcases the man alone, with just his guitar and songs for company. The album features Michaels stunning interpretation of the Townes Van Zandt song, Marie. The accompanying video perfectly captures the mood of the song, and has been nominated for awards in the UK. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3k-D4bQnQ</p> <p>Coming up are 2 new albums, both set for release in 2010. Later in the year will be the release of a pure country duets album, My Darling Clementine, made with his wife, the acclaimed singer Lou Dalgleish, and featuring the talents of Geraint Watkins, Martin Belmont, Bobby Irwin, and many other legendary British musicians.</p> <p>Before that, the new solo album, called “I Didn’t Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier” an album made up entirely of Protest songs. Some news ones, written specially, and some older ones that are still as relevant today as when they were first written, some going as far back as the 1920’s. An outspoken album, a modern album for these troubled times.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7774572/f5dffa7028a17588c762910032d98ab2_poster.jpeg",""

They met in the indie band May or May Not, but after hearing mash-up DJs like Girl Talk and Them Jeans, they headed straight for the laptop and began combining Lil Wayne with Modest Mouse, Swizz Beatz with Deerhoof, and R. Kelly with Jens Lekman. Initial results were uploaded to the Hood Internet blog in 2007 and it didn’t take long for the music to explode. Right-click downloads quickly ticked into the thousands and by the end of the year New York Magazine had featured the band. The Hood Internet Mixtape, Vol. 1 also landed in 2007, while 2008’s mixtape The Hood Internet vs Chicago landed on some media year-end Top Ten lists, including Current TV’s. For music not released in any traditional format, it was a milestone, as it was in 2009 when the Ting Tings performed their song “Shut Up and Let Me Go” live with a bit of Estelle’s “American Boy” in the middle, a nod to the Hood Internet’s mash-up mix of the songs. In 2010 the group got some cool corporate sponsorship when the New York City streetwear brand Mishka sponsored their Trillwave mixtape. In 2012, the Hood Internet moved beyond the mash-up with their debut studio album, Feat. Released by the Decon label, Feat featured a wide range of guests including Black Moth Super Rainbow’s Tobacco, AC Newman, and Kid Static.","<p>A mash-up crew who came to fame thanks to their genre-jumping mixes, the Hood Internet were formed in Chicago after members Aaron Brink (<span class=""caps"">ABX</span>) and Steve Reidell (<span class=""caps"">STV</span> <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">SLV</span></span>) both moved to the city with fresh college diplomas.

Both established DJs in Chicago prior to their alliance as Flosstradamus, J2K and Autobot initially linked up while DJing a house party together in 2005, decided to start performing as a duo, and the rest is history. Gathering vast influences from their respective backgrounds in punk and hip-hop, Flosstradamus brought normally divided crowds together with their unique mixes of Baltimore club, hip-hop, house, obscure remixes, and juke. A monthly party soon followed (“Get Outta The Hood”) at Chicago’s Town Hall Pub, and within a year Flosstradamus turned a stagnant bar into the proverbial place-to-be, lines stretching down the block while sweaty kids crowd surf and get down inside. National press soon began to take notice, with features in URB (“Next 100 for 2006”), MTV (featured in “My Block”), and The Fader. Other recent accolades of note include 2006 appearances at SXSW, CMJ, Pitchfork Festival, Pop Montreal, parties for VICE, The Fader, Jane Magazine, DKNY, URB, and Puma, not to mention performances with Clipse, Common, and Rick Ross. In the coming year, Flosstradamus plan to show off the rest of their multifaceted talent.

Since the release of their debut single “Up All Night”, FHR have been swept along by a flurry of accolades from radio, press and bloggers alike, including a Record of the Week from BBC Radio 1’s Nick Grimshaw and the coveted Single of the Week slot in French music bible Les Inrockuptibles, who described the band’s sound as the “euphoric soundtrack to 2010”. Now back in their current residence of Brooklyn, NY, after a whistle stop trip to Europe for a series of madcap shows and radio interviews, FHR are already planning a speedy return with “Beaches & Friends”, their new EP (with a difference) and recent Hype Machine No.1 slated for a March 1st release. And with the brothers currently cooped up in their studio lairs concocting some brand new musical potions for their forthcoming debut album, all bodes rather well for 2010. “Up All Night”, released on new UK indie Once Upon A Time Records, also received radio plays from the likes of Kissy Sellout, Alex Metric, new boys Jaymo & Andy George and Zane Lowe on Radio 1 and from XFM tastemakers Eddie Temple Morris and John Kennedy. Mixmag made it Electro Tune of the Month, Artrocker gave it 5 stars for its “sparkling synths and vocal bridges of epic scale” and to top things off French label Kitsuné chose it for the highly prestigious opening slot on their latest Kitsuné Maison 8 Compilation. FHR also found themselves fans outside music circles, most notably in Graham Linehan, comedy writer (IT Crowd, The Fast Show) and member of Twitter’s royalty, who tweets about the band at every opportunity. New single “Beaches & Friends” co-written with Brazilian duo Database, friends and recent touring mates of FHR, is not quite what you would expect though. Robert explains: “The coolest thing about ‘Beaches & Friends’ is that the original track doesn’t actually exist. It was the result of a big collaboration between us and a bunch of our friends. We and Database came up with the vocal hooks and synth lines, and from there all the different versions were created. The French Horn Rebellion NYC version, Database’s Club Edit, the Twelves’ Radio and Remix versions, and finally the Hey Champ Remix. Every track is a variation on a theme, a similar idea to Edward Elgar’s “Enigma Variations.” In fact the Beaches & Friends EP is kind of a modern-day Enigma Variations.” For David: “it’s a story about the search for your muse.” The media response to Beaches & Friends has even eclipsed that of “Up All Night” with continued radio support from Radio 1 including DJ’s Annie Mac, Nick Grimshaw, Jaymo & Andy George and new queen of daytime Radio 1 Fearne Cotton giving the single heavy spins. Tips for 2010 in Time Out London, influential dance magazines DJ and Mixmag and The Guardian, an NME Radar feature and another Single of the Week in Les Inrockuptibles continues the press support. And on the live front a UK tour, a prestigious support to Hot Chip in New York, an appearance at Paris Fashion Week, a busy schedule at SXSW and a European tour in May including dates in Germany, Austria and Switzerland with Sebastian, will ensure the buzz continues to build well into 2010. The Oxegen, Relentless Boardmasters and Bestival festivals are confirmed with more in the pipeline. 2007 feels like a long time ago now, when younger brother Robert, an accomplished French horn player, found himself as principal horn chair of the prestigious Northwestern University Symphony Orchestra. Standing at a crossroads, and fundamentally frustrated by the demands of mastering such an instrument (that he knew would never allow him to fully express himself), he finally asked his brother David to rebel with him, and together they embarked on a life-long creative journey. That journey is well under way.","<p>As 2009 drew to a close, for Robert and David Perlick-Molinari (aka French Horn Rebellion), two brothers born and bred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the world was a very different place to the one that started it.

Inspired by the magnetism of San Francisco, the grind of Los Angeles and the serenity of the Big Sur Coast, their songs are a joyous revival of rock n’ roll, a twisting indie-folk dance and a heartfelt protest ballad. Sliding from indie pop to country and a host of genres in between, the band evokes modern artists such as Fun., Grouplove and Edward Sharpe And the Magnetic Zeros, whilst having their roots in the music of Neil Young, The Byrds, The Beach Boys and Fleetwood Mac. Part 60’s Laurel Canyon, part 70’s Venice Beach and part 10’s Silverlake, the band and the harmonies are held together by their message of universal love, peace and the belief that the highest form of consciousness is achieved by togetherness and unity. Their recent release, “Sound The Drum” has cemented them as a rapidly rising artist with a difference. Uplifting, collaborative, joyous and communal, the album is a walk through their life thus far: Meeting each other (“Hi Hey There Hello”), experiencing together (“San Francisco”, “The Great Divide”, “I’ve Been Around”), fighting and making up (“Colin’s Song”), emerging stronger (“Carry Your Will”, “We Are Free”) – their message is finding a foothold with fans from every walk of life, bringing people together under one roof to celebrate each other.","<p class=""p1"">5 childhood friends from the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, augmented by 3 mid-western transplants, The Mowgli’s are a quintessential California band.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/torres","Torres","","","When does a musician finally hit upon his or her particular “sound”? For some, it bursts forth from their body fully formed; for others, it takes months or sometimes years of trial-and-error. For Mackenzie Scott, the singer-songwriter from Nashville who performs under the name Torres, the foundation and framework of her distinctive sound were already in place but it just needed that one crucial final piece.“My family pitched in to get me a Gibson 335 last year for Christmas,” she says. “I didn’t quite find the sound I was looking for until I started playing electric.” Listen to her self-titled debut album and you’ll hear just how crucial that instrument is to her songs now. The delicacy and intimacy that was born from acoustic roots are still there, but now that she’s fully plugged in, her music has intensified, with deeper shades of darkness creeping into the mix.The album also carries with it a rawness and humanism that only serves to increase the feelings of isolation, longing, fear, guilt, revelation, and resolution that Scott expresses beautifully throughout. Torres was recorded over the course of five days in a Tennessee home owned by fellow singer-songwriter Tony Joe White (he of “Polk Salad Annie” fame), and recorded live to tape with as few overdubs as could be managed.“I wanted this record to be the most honest version of itself that it could be,” the 22-year-old songwriter says, “and ultimately that meant that it needed to remain unpolished and fairly raw. I left in a few imperfect vocal takes because I thought it sounded more human that way.”The effect provides the album with a rough-hewn beauty. The cracks that sharpen the edges of songs like the pointed “Jealousy & I” or the drum machine-driven “Chains” gives listeners an even starker look into the heart of these deeply felt songs. And if you lean in close, you might be able to hear the creak of the wooden floors in the house and the hum of the tape machine capturing it all.To preserve the sonic warmth and integrity of this gritty, heartfelt album, Torres will be available on double vinyl, as well as on CD and digital formats. No matter how you listen to it, though, the songs will cut right to the bone. Scott spills every inch of her soul on these tracks, reflecting the joys and sorrows, and the unpredictability and uncertainty of life and love.","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; line-height: 14px; font-size: 11px; "">When does a musician finally hit upon his or her particular “sound”?

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/night-beds","Night Beds","COLORADO SPRINGS, NASHVILLE, Colorado, US","indie, under 2000 listeners, folk","It’s difficult to say where Night Beds begins, but it could be here: August 2006, a young Winston Yellen is invited to a longtime friend’s apartment. They talk, they record a little aimlessly, and something exciting emerges. Maybe it’s a little later, when one is studying engineering in Nashville, and the other remains behind, an unhappy captive of secondary education. It could be any number of moments, really, along a series of migrations, but probably here: the summer of 2008, back in Colorado Springs, when they write the first Night Beds song, “You Were Afraid.” God knows that we try to do the best we can After that there is a lot of time spent in basements, a lot of alcohol, a lot of irreverent tuning, but not all that much need for talk.

They talk, they record a little aimlessly, and something <br /> exciting emerges. Maybe it’s a little later, when one is studying <br /> engineering in Nashville, and the other remains behind, an unhappy <br /> captive of secondary education. It could be any number of moments,<br /> really, along a series of migrations, but probably here: the summer of <br /> 2008, back in Colorado Springs, when they write the first Night Beds <br /> song, “You Were Afraid.”<br> <br> God knows that we try to do the best we can<br> <br> After that there is a lot of time spent in basements, a lot of alcohol,<br /> a lot of irreverent tuning, but not all that much need for talk.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/john-talabot","John Talabot","CG","dj, house, deep house, mysterious","If there is one person, who has been causing a stir on the international club circuit recently, it is Barcelona’s John Talabot. Already his debut “My Old School“ (which is meant literally by the way) on Permanent Vacation in 2009 and shortly after that the single “ Sunshine”, which he put out on his own Hivern Disc imprint, made him one of the most promising musicians of the Spanish electronic scene. And those two releases also already set the mark for John Talabot’s unparalleled music: raw, loopy, heavy on the kick drum, sample based, moderate on the tempo, distorted on the drums and light years away from the clean and ever revolving house sound of today. This unique style which also blends influences from afro beat, Detroit techno, Chicago house and cosmic disco, but also northern soul or the energy of Flamenco, immediately turned some heads around. James Murphy, Âme and Aeroplane started including Talabot music in their sets like it was the most natural thing. However – and this is quite rare – he not only gained legions of fans in the house and disco community, but also amongst the leftfield pop and indie rock followers. NME and Resident Advisor both had “Breakthrough“ features on John Talabot and he can be proud of a “Best New Music“ dubbing on Pitchfork. (Being rather elusive on showing his face in magazines or the web it also came to some funny rumors that John Talabot was the alter ego of a well-known techno producer from Detroit). At the same time he drew the attention of like-minded artists like James Holden and Luke Abott from Border Community, Blondes or Delorean, which lead to a bunch of fertile collaborations: Luke Abbot and Blondes remixed Talabot’s “Sunshine“ single , John Talabot remixed a track by Delorean and vice versa Delorean’s Ekhi contributed vocals to the track “Journeys “ on John’s album). Another example is the Young Turks Label (home of Jamie XX, Holy Fuck, El Guincho or SBTRKT ) on which he released the “Families“ EP in 2010. It was praised beyond limits. Pitchfork for instance hailed: “… where pop and house influences sweetly buffer up against one another to provide an unyielding sense of elation“ and even brought Talabot a comparison with artists like Four Tet or Caribou. While staying true to his sound, John Talabot has nevertheless shown a constant evolution as a producer since his first release. He has traced a solid musical path that has turned him into one of the big references of European House and has made him also a highly in demand Remixer (for the likes of The XX, Francesco Tristano’s “Aufgang” project, Shit Robot on DFA, Thaiti 80, Joakim or Teengirl Fantasy to name just a few ). A progression that now crystallizes in “ƒin”, his first full-length album for Permanent Vacation. A record, in which the Barcelona mastermind sets aside the danceable immediacy to expand his stylistic palette more than ever. For that purpose, Talabot melts all the elements that have constructed his distinctive sound until now and makes them emerge from a new perspective, in which the construction of complex song structures, intricate rhythms and superpositions of ever-evolving melodies and atmospheres pick up the baton of the “a kick-drum and a sampler” philosophy of his initial productions. The result brings us 11 tracks (we should call them songs really!) dominated by dark ambiances, gaseous textures and bittersweet moods that, above all, reveal a kind of vivacity that’s really hard to find in contemporary electronics. “Fin” is far from being a track collection. From the majestic opener “Depak Ine“ to it’s solemn ending with “So Will Be Now“ , one of the two tracks that features Talabot’s soul and label mate Pional, each song traces an overall dialogue with the rest, culminating a highly emotional journey through Talabot’s always compelling and unique musical vision.","<p>If there is one person, who has been causing a stir on the international club circuit recently, it is Barcelona’s John Talabot.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/tremor-low","Tremor Low","Oakland","","Tremor Low writes songs that are dynamic, raucous, and designed to nod heads and shake hips. Having been described as both guitar-based new wave and synth-heavy post-punk, Tremor Low combines machine gun drumming with angular guitar parts. A recent song, “Peter Murphy’s Dead” deals with a strong desire to one day be king of the the goths and to steal their women.

Hailing from the heartland of America, Omaha-based trio Icky Blossoms unabashedly combine bass-heavy electro, hazy indie pop and indie rock on their upcoming debut, out July 17th on the revered indie label, Saddle Creek. Comprised of vocalist/keys Sarah Bohling, Tilly and the Wall guitarist and vocalist, Derek Pressnall, and lead guitar/vocalist and acclaimed multimedia artist, Nik Fackler, Icky Blossoms formed through personal friendship and a mutual desire to make a socially conscious, multifaceted art experience. Aurally, the trio creates music that spans from the anthemic to the introverted, chronicling a great variety of the twists and turns of the human condition. Combining dystopian yet warm vocals with rock orchestration and pulsating electronic lines and sampling, Icky Blossoms nod to great subgenres of the past, namely electroclash and dancepunk, while creating songs that are boldly fresh and on the audio vanguard. Icky Blossoms’ unique posturing sparked the interest of esteemed artist and producer Dave Sitek from TV on the Radio, who produced the self-titled debut. With a love for fashion, background in visual arts and an Independent Spirit Award amongst them, the trio strives to integrate short films, avant-garde soundtracking projects, graphic art and collaborations with couturiers into their formula.","<p>Some bands make lasting impacts by refusing to be subservient to a singular genre, fusing styles and creating music that spans a wide gamut of audible possibility.

Produced by Jean Paul Fung (Bluejuice, Last Dinosaurs), the single is the latest to be taken from their forthcoming EP, “Collarbone Jungle” – due late September – and will be supported by a string of headline tour dates. “The song itself isn’t just a single sonic snapshot, conceptually it is made up of a multitude of my own experiences, of all the house parties I went to when I was in high school.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/cave-painting","Cave Painting","Brighton","rock, indie, pop","Sometimes you have to delve deep among the roots of a band to truly understand where they sit today. And searching for the origins of Brighton five-piece Cave Painting requires a burrow into their previous incarnation – a learning curve they wouldn’t be so fully formed or layered now without having experienced (and cast off). So it was that singer Adam Kane, keyboard player Sam Simon, guitarist Harry Smallwood, bassist Richard Snabel and drummer Jonathan McCawley came together from cities and towns scattered around the country to Brighton, formed a band, called it Rob The Rich, and promptly began writing and playing together. This group of friends soon hit on something that felt right – but not quite right quite yet. “It was… focused on the live show,” Rich explains of the first band’s untethered, frenetic sound. A moderate amount of ears were pricked, tours undertaken, a brief froth of hype. And then things changed. Or rather, they grew. “We’d written some new songs, and our previous manager didn’t like them,” laughs Rich. “He gave us an ultimatum,” adds Adam. “It was, ‘Do it the way I think you should do it, or that’s it.” And so, that was it. ‘It’ being the real birth of Cave Painting. This new batch of songs saw them shedding the more immature clatter of that first band into something more epic, confident and classy. They locked themselves in Brighton’s Electric Studios, where a couple of them also worked on and off to pay the bills. Over a period of six months away from sunlight, something special blossomed. “We just learned about atmosphere,” Sam sums up, succinctly. “We just had the rest of the day after working until 11am to have fun.” “We had a new kind of freedom,” agrees Adam. “Yeah,” adds Sam, “this love for what we were doing – and over six months we wrote without any intentions of really doing anything. We weren’t trying to get a deal.” Which is always the best attitude to have towards taking forward steps to success – and they didn’t need to grasp after anything. By the time Cave Painting announced their first live show, at London’s The Social in April 2011, demos had been fizzing around the inboxes of the movers and shakers of the capital’s industry bigwigs, and the venue was packed to the rafters, “One of the guys we work with looked at the guest list on the way in,” remembers Sam. “One of our mates heard him say, ‘Jesus, if they screw this up… that’s it.” ? But there was no screw up. And after storming that show, Cave Painting were soon on the road that saw them firming up a deal with Third Rock Recordings, the label set up by former Parlophone MD Keith Wozencroft, the man who signed Radiohead and built a roster that included Sigur Ros, Gorillaz, Coldplay, Kylie and LCD Soundsystem. A path was outlined, and in November 2011 after trying out a few producers they settled on Barny Barnicott, (Artic Monkeys, Kasabian) and at his Bluebell studios in Kent they crafted ‘Votive Life’ – Cave Painting’s debut album, set for release in the Autumn. By this point the band were well honed and slick – and the album was in the bag within two months, no dramas, and acted as a slingshot into a UK-wide tour with Alt-J as well as a slew of their own headline shows. Touch-points those who witnessed the shows were the bands who straddle the line between unashamedly epic and delicately deft – and it’s always the finest of lines. All members of Cave Painting love The National and Arcade Fire – stuff that feels right in front of thousands, a strong enough pull for the masses, but with no compromise, nothing sold-out, and nothing lost with the expansion. “It’s about riding that line of epic-ness,” agrees Sam. “But it’s not something that we’ve specifically set out to do. We haven’t really set out to do anything.” It’s natural. There are droplets of a number of possible influences bubbling and rising in album opener ‘Leaf’, subtle Wild Beasts-esque flurries in ‘Gator’, shadows of the hum and glow of ‘Neon Bible’-era Arcade Fire cutting through ‘Only Us’, but everywhere a no-bullshit uniqueness, the niggling feeling that you’ve never quite heard anything like this before. And it’s this that will cut Cave Painting apart from anything else you will hear this year. A band born of almost accidental greatness and ambition. No grand statements, no game plan, no nut job back stories – just a king’s wealth of music that glows with beauty and vision. And sometimes that means more than anything else.","<p>Sometimes you have to delve deep among the roots of a band to truly understand where they sit today.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/los-lonely-boys","Los Lonely Boys","San Angelo, TX","rock, blues, latin","Los Lonely Boys (Henry, Ringo, and Jojo Garza) announce the upcoming release of 1969, an EP of covers that pays tribute to one of America’s most musically hailed years. Five years after crossing into the mainstream with the GRAMMY winning single “Heaven,” the brothers take this opportunity to invoke the sound of a generation that walked the moon and transcended Woodstock. They lend praise to songs that provided a soundtrack for so many and inspired their own multi-platinum success. With their signature blend of Latin rhythms, searing guitar leads and impeccable harmonies, the band takes the opportunity to trace their musical lineage through the following tracks: Carlos Santana’s “Evil Ways,” The Beatles’ “She Came In Through the Bathroom Window,” Tony Joe White’s “Polk Salad Annie,” and The Doors’ “Roadhouse Blues.” Legendary engineer Andy Johns provides his signature, timeless sound to 1969. In addition to recording Blind Faith’s “Well All Right” – also a featured track on the EP – Johns is well known for his work on Led Zeppelin II, III, IV and The Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main St. Close friend Carlos Santana once told the brothers ""When you’re up on that stage or when you record, you want to be the tool that shines light through to everybody."" Los Lonely Boys always took his message to heart and more so now than ever with their spirited renditions of these classic tracks that they hope will appeal to their current audiences as well as attract new ones that appreciate this generation of music. Listen at Last.fmIt's been a wild ride for San Angelo, Texas natives Henry, JoJo and Ringo Garza, aka Los Lonely Boys. They've come a long way since their days backing their old man (Henry, Sr.) playing country covers in bars while still in their teens, but it's a credit to their deep himility — and a work ethic as strong as the blood-brother harmonies that define their soulful Texican rock 'n' roll sound — that they haven't become spoiled rock stars, even though they've gotten far bigger than they'd ever imaged since launching their self-titled debut in 2003. The tally so far: a hit (Heaven), a major-label deal, a Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (for More Than Love), a song recorded with idol Carolos Santana, and an impromptu recital for Paul McCartney…not to mention opening for the Stones, a friendship with mentor Willie Nelson, all the media coverage and even a documentary, Los Lonely Boys: Cottonfields and Crossroads.

But with this strong second offering, they won't have to worry about fading away anytime soon.","<p>Los Lonely Boys (Henry, Ringo, and Jojo Garza) announce the upcoming release of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/1969-Los-Lonely-Boys/dp/B002N1C10Q"" rel=""nofollow"">1969</a>, an EP of covers that pays tribute to one of America’s most musically hailed years. Five years after crossing into the mainstream with the <span class=""caps"">GRAMMY</span> winning single “Heaven,” the brothers take this opportunity to invoke the sound of a generation that walked the moon and transcended Woodstock. They lend praise to songs that provided a soundtrack for so many and inspired their own multi-platinum success. With their signature blend of Latin rhythms, searing guitar leads and impeccable harmonies, the band takes the opportunity to trace their musical lineage through the following tracks: Carlos Santana’s “Evil Ways,” The Beatles’ “She Came In Through the Bathroom Window,” Tony Joe White’s “Polk Salad Annie,” and The Doors’ “Roadhouse Blues.” Legendary engineer Andy Johns provides his signature, timeless sound to 1969. In addition to recording Blind Faith’s “Well All Right” – also a featured track on the EP – Johns is well known for his work on Led Zeppelin II, <span class=""caps"">III</span>, IV and The Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main St. Close friend Carlos Santana once told the brothers ""When you’re up on that stage or when you record, you want to be the tool that shines light through to everybody."" Los Lonely Boys always took his message to heart and more so now than ever with their spirited renditions of these classic tracks that they hope will appeal to their current audiences as well as attract new ones that appreciate this generation of music. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Los+Lonely+Boys"" target=""_blank"">Listen at Last.fm</a><br />It's been a wild ride for San Angelo, Texas natives Henry, JoJo and Ringo Garza, aka Los Lonely Boys. They've come a long way since their days backing their old man (Henry, Sr.) playing country covers in bars while still in their teens, but it's a credit to their deep himility — and a work ethic as strong as the blood-brother harmonies that define their soulful Texican rock 'n' roll sound — that they haven't become spoiled rock stars, even though they've gotten far bigger than they'd ever imaged since launching their self-titled debut in 2003. The tally so far: a hit (Heaven), a major-label deal, a Grammy for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (for More Than Love), a song recorded with idol Carolos Santana, and an impromptu recital for Paul McCartney…not to mention opening for the Stones, a friendship with mentor Willie Nelson, all the media coverage and even a documentary, Los Lonely Boys: Cottonfields and Crossroads. And in July, the three bluesy brothers will release their second studio album, Sacred, which declares in the very first song, My Way, that they're going to continue making music as they choose, regardless of what anyone else expects.

Kicking off the set is the compelling rocker “Sugar Muffin,” belying its title with tales of transgression and defiance. The moving and sultry video to “Sugar Muffin” is directed by Andrew Shapter (The Roots, Willie Nelson) who produced the award winning short Before The Music Dies. Of the video making process, Michelle commented, “I treasured the process of filming the music video for ‘Sugar Muffin.’ It allowed me to experience the lyrics in a very physical, and fervent way. There is a battle between human confidence, (believing that I am a better catch than the new lover), and the unmistakable jealousy that can’t be avoided within the heart.”Dame came to the attention of Kevin Wommack and Playing In Traffic Records when Michelle’s companion, actor Matt Lauria, was working on the set of the Emmy award winning show Friday Night Lights in Austin, TX.

Sahara showed great promise as a singer/songwriter at the young age of nine when her mother, a writer herself, was astounded by her gifts. Sahara began performing in Wimberly, Texas, where her family moved years later. Shortly afterwards, when she was fifteen, she won a nationwide contest to perform on Garrison Keillorʼs PBS Prairie Home Companion where Sahara scored second place in audience applause. She was also the only artist invited to do a duet with Garrison Keillor. Now, at twenty, Sahara has moved back to Austin and labels and critics are taking notice of her, making her the standout artist at many key Austin music festivals like SXSW and ACL. Most recently, renowned producer, T-Bone Burnett, has taken an interest in Saharaʼs talent stating that “Sahara is the best young artist I have heard in many years. The world needs some great young artists. It is time.” Subsequently, T-Bone has had Sahara recording in his Los Angeles studio. Michael Ventura, author and columnist, wrote a feature article about Sahara in the Austin Chronicle after seeing her perform at SXSW. Michael wrote, “Youʼre the most gifted young performer Iʼve seen in 26 years.” Sahara is a beautiful, elegant singer/songwriter who writes brilliant lyrics far beyond her years and has a voice that is enchanting and spellbinding.","<p>Sahara Smith was born into a family of artists in Austin, Texas in 1988.

Alone, these anecdotes go well with a fistful of peanuts at a cocktail party. But on top of these add that this person also co-wrote the longest-running song on the Billboard Top 100, had a debut solo album that earned three and a half stars in Rolling Stone, and was awarded the title of “San Diego’s Most Influential Artist of the Decade” at the San Diego Music Awards. What you end up with is one of the most engaging, twisted, and prolific songwriters of our time – Steve Poltz. “Paying dues” is certainly not a foreign concept to most successful musicians, but Steve seems to have single handedly redefined what that phrase means. Born among the hearty, seafaring folk of Halifax, Nova Scotia, his parents up and moved him to Palm Springs, where he was raised. After a rather liberal approach to the liberal arts at the University of San Diego, Poltz began his colorful musical career selling pipe nipples. Let us forego the fact that pipe nipples exist, let alone the fact that an entire industry seems to be devoted to their commerce. No, we need to confront how it is that a pipe nipple guy from Palm Springs ended up flying around the world in a private jet, playing songs like “SkyfuckinglineofToronto” to stadiums full of rabid, screaming fans. OK, here’s the thing- like the question of what Richard Nixon ever saw in Pat, there are no easy answers. What we do know is that at some point, Steve decided to bid the pipe nipple industry sweet adieu, and became a full time musician. He started out playing bars and coffee houses around San Diego, eventually forming the college radio favorite band, The Rugburns. The Rugburns are well-known and appreciated by DJs all over the country, due in no small part to the fact that the anthemic “Dick’s Automotive” was long enough to afford them the opportunity to relieve themselves and then some during their shows. The Rugburns blended punk, pop, folk, and if you listen close enough, you might just hear the slightest hint of a whisper of the possibility of Swedish Christian Death Metal. They were so freaking good that they found themselves in a crappy old van 300+ days a year, playing packed and sold out clubs and bars all over the country. The weird thing is that with a catalogue of literally hundreds of songs and three albums behind them, they developed a fan base that put the “U” in cult-like. Steve would write a song onstage in one city, and two nights and two time zones later, there would be people screaming for that very song at another show. So there he is, more prolific than two rabbits on E, traveling the country playing songs about truckers feeding strychnine-laced granola to deer, and he starts writing songs like “Lockjaw,” an achingly sweet and sincere love song.

Writing in The New York Times, the great rock critic Robert Palmer called him “one of the most gifted singer-songwriters to emerge from the New York scene in years.” He made his recording debut in 1980 with his acclaimed self-titled LP on Arista Records, following it a year later with Golden Down. He also opened the Who’s North American tour at the personal request of the band. In 1982, he signed to Geffen Records but got caught in record-biz limbo and didn’t manage to release another record until 1991, when Columbia issued Places I Have Never Been. With the EP Hard Times in America in 1992, which became a cult favorite throughout Europe, Nile finally managed to jump off the major-label hamster wheel. Gathering together his resources over time, he managed to put out his first self-released album, Beautiful Wreck of the World in 1999.

Scheduled for release June 9 on Bar/None Records, it features Branford Marsalis on two tracks: the single “Early in the Morning” and Peter’s ode to New Orleans, “Begin Again.” Drum aces Jon Wurster (Superchunk, Son Volt, Bob Mould, the Mountain Goats), Logan Matheny (Roman Candle, The Rosebuds), and percussionist Gary Greene (Hootie and the Blowfish, Big Head Todd and the Monsters) bring power to tracks such as “Some of the Parts” and “Widescreen World”, and the dB’s’ rhythm section Gene Holder and Will Rigby join in on the atmospheric “Santa Monica.” The acoustic side of the duo, reminiscent of their 1992 RNA album “Mavericks,” comes to the fore on tracks such as “Long Time Coming,” one of several that feature Greg Readling (Chatham County Line, Tift Merritt) on pedal steel. The lead track, “My Friend the Sun,” is a cover of a classic from the legendary British prog-pop band Family. Peter and Chris grew up together in Winston-Salem, NC, and started playing music together in middle school—and have really never stopped. Through countless bands along the way—including Rittenhouse Square, Little Diesel, Sneakers, the H-Bombs, the dB’s, Continental Drifters, the Golden Palominos—and recording sessions and sideman stints with the likes of R.E.M., Bob Mould and Hootie and the Blowfish, the two have maintained a deep musical connection. They both are proficient at most string and keyboard instruments, and neither is much good at winds! Having relocated to Durham, NC, from New Orleans in 2006, Peter is constantly evident in international musical situations while Chris produces many records each year at Modern Recording, his home base in Chapel Hill, NC, where this record was made.","<p>“hERE aND nOw” is the first new collaboration in almost two decades by Peter Holsapple and Chris Stamey, the acclaimed songwriters of the dB’s.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-silos","The Silos","New York NY","","In 1985, when vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Walter Salas-Humara recorded a handful of tunes with the help of a dozen and a half friends and collected the songs under the title About Her Steps, he probably wasn’t thinking that it was the start of a career in music that’s now approaching 20 years and still going strong. No, at that point, he was too busy thinking about, among other things, names. ""In the beginning, I didn’t want to use my name because I thought it was too hard for people to deal with,"" explains Salas-Humara when discussing the origin of the Silos name. ""So I came up with a name that was two syllables, easy to roll of the tongue, and works in all languages more or less."" With a name in hand, as well as some (in his words) ""unexpected interest"" in About Her Steps, Salas-Humara put together a touring band. That line-up made Cuba, originally released in 1987, an exhilarating album that introduced the Silos’ enviable ability to communicate effectively in both a whisper and a howl. Cuba attracted national attention. The video for ""Tennessee Fire"" was played by MTV and the band was voted ""Best New American Band"" by the Rolling Stone critic’s poll. The band subsequently signed to RCA Records and the third album under the Silos name (self-titled, but often conveniently referred to as The One With The Bird On The Cover) was even better and led to an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. Its spacious, organic quality made it seem out of place in 1990; however, looking back at the album from within the Alternative-Indy glow of the decade’s end, The Silos resonates like the work of visionaries. Since that landmark album, Salas-Humara has kept the Silos name alive with a continuing series of impassioned recordings and miles and miles of roadwork. Four Silos studio albums, Hasta La Victoria (1992) and Susan Across The Ocean (1994), Heater (1998). Laser Beam Next Door (2001), and When The Telephone Rings (2004) followed. The latest album, Come On Like The Fast Lane, is their most accomplished to date, mixing primitive rock, edgy psychedelia and down-home organic soul without reservation. Salas-Humara has also released several solo albums, produced several others for such kindred spirits as Michael Hall and Jim Roll, was a founding member of the seminal soul/drone band The Vulgar Boatmen, did some guest drumming on Hazeldine’s Orphans, and joined Hall and Alejandro Escovedo in a two-off named The Setters. Ira Robbins, writing in The Trouser Press Record Guide, describes Salas-Humara as an ""unflashy auteur whose alt-rock amalgam drapes country, punk, baroque stateliness and pop in an abiding sadness."" When you look at Salas-Humara’s wide-ranging career and his dedication to the art of songwriting, it’s definitely not a stretch to include his name alongside the likes of Escovedo, REM, Lucinda Williams, Stephen Malkmus, and Neil Young. These days, Salas-Humara is enjoying the stability of a Silos line-up that’s been together longer than any other, closing in on nine years, with Drew Glackin on bass and lap steel and Konrad Meissner on drums. ""We all enjoy each other’s company quite a bit"" is Salas-Humara’s take on this longevity. ""And stylistically, it all locks together in an interesting way. Visceral guitar playing combined with very melodic bass work and eclectic drumming works in a trio format. And to have the steel guitar (courtesy of Glackin) on the quieter songs adds a whole other dimension."" The Silos create a sound that’s hard to pin down. According to Buzz McClain in The Washington Post, the band creates ""powerful earthy pop that sounds like the result of Nirvana riding on R.E.M.‘s tour bus."" ""The band’s austere style inflects the astringent twang of The Velvet Underground with the drone of R.E.M. and adds countryish echoes that recall Gram Parsons,"" offered Stephen Holden in The New York Times. ""We get compared to everybody,"" says Salas-Humara. ""To some people, we’re a country band. To other people, we’re a rock band. To other people, we’re an acoustic band. Some people think we’re rootsy, and others think we’re arty."" He pauses to take a breath and to chuckle at the breadth of it all. ""We’re all of those things."" Yes, every one of those descriptions is accurate, a snapshot of the truth taken from a different angle. The music of Salas-Humara and his bandmates is the sound of ideas, styles, and maybe even cultures colliding. It deftly combines a big beat with a nothing-wasted leanness, and it’s music that possesses a unique blending of intensity and approachability, with the ferocious rockers tilting you back on your heels just as quickly as the hushed, tightly coiled ballads draw you closer. So how should one sum up the music of the Silos? With a new album on the shelves and a trail of memorable shows (from performances in large music halls to intimate house concerts) both behind them and in front of them, let’s just call it enduring.

He’s been inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame three times, in 2000 as a solo artist, in 2008 as a member of the Skunks, and in 2009 as a member of the True Believers. In 2006, the readers of the Austin Chronicle named him Austin Musician of the Year. In 2008, Graham was the subject of a portrait-of-the-artist documentary, Swept Away, which is available nationally on DVD. In its final issue, No Depression magazine called the film, “superb.” Shortly after the films release in the Spring of 2008, Graham survived a one car crash on Texas’ I-35 that claimed his spleen, left him with a zipper scar up his chest, and permanently wreaked havoc on his back and neck. Despite a massive hospital bill – or perhaps because of it – Graham was back at work about one month later at his beloved Continental Club in Austin. He’s barely slowed down since, finding time to write and record a new album – his first studio record since 2006 — and making time to develop a new weekly live residency, Jon Dee and Friend, — whose guests have included Kelly Willis, Alejandro Escovedo, James McMurtry, & Curt Kirkwood amongst others. It’s Not As Bad As it Looks, Graham’s 2010 release is about — you guessed it – second chances, hope, sin & redemption, the constant search for higher meaning and a path forward, and trying to walk that fine line life often forces upon you. And it’s all delivered through Jon Dee Graham’s unique prism of pointed lyrics, searing guitar, and arrangements that sway between touching ballads and balls out rock with a punk edge. “I know this is loaded and I am way too close to it” Graham says, “but I think it’s my best record since my first one, Escape From Monster Island.” It’s Not As Bad As It Looks was recorded at Austin’s Wire Recording with Stuart Sullivan at the helm. Graham produced with his long-time musical partner and cohort, Mike Hardwick. Another stalwart compadre, Andrew Duplantis, of Son Volt, was on bass. And Joey Sheffield held down the backbeat with help from another Austin fixture, drummer Daren Hess. It’s Not As Bad As It Looks is Graham’s seventh record overall and his fourth album with Freedom Records.","<p>Indie / Rock / Folk Rock</p> <p>Jon Dee Graham is a legend on the Austin music scene.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/james-mcmurtry","James McMurtry","AUSTIN, Un","singer-songwriter, alt-country, americana","James L. McMurtry, along with his Austin-based band, James McMurtry & The Heartless Bastards, is a self-described “rock & roots” guitarist and singer-songwriter, drawing on elements of alt-country, folk and old-fashioned texas rock. The son of novelist Larry McMurtry, James was born in Fort Worth, Texas in 1962, and grew up in Virginia. James McMurtry’s seventh studio album, Childish Things, was released on Compadre Records in the fall of 2005. As writer L.E.Brady notes, ""The album includes McMurtry’s statement on American decline – We Can’t Make It Here – his most unabashedly political number yet."" Just Us Kids— released in 2008, is McMurtry’s ninth full-length album. While he insists that “the majority of the songs are not political,” it’s also clear that he’s not even close to abandoning his burgeoning role as a searing political gadfly. The core band throughout is McMurtry on guitar, his longtime road band The Heartless Bastards (bassist Ronnie Johnson and drummer Daren Hess) and “guest Bastard” Ian McLagan (The Faces) on keys. So, roll over Kate Smith — this “God Bless America (pat mAcdonald Must Die)” bears no resemblance to the ubiquitous Irving Berlin chest-thumper; it’s a scorched-earth cataloging of the old-boys’ club glad-handing, cronyism and “belly up to the trough” feeding-frenzy of corporate and state war profiteers. “Cheney’s Toy” juxtaposes the Hollywood hubris of the Bush administration against images of Guantanamo and a brain-damaged U.S. veteran. “The Governor” probes the roles of class and wealth in the solving and prosecution of crimes, and “Ruins of the Realm” sorts through the fallout and detritus of a cynical, unilateral approach to global “mapping.” “Ruby and Carlos” looks at a relationship eroded by miscommunication and conflicting ambitions (with Gulf War Syndrome further roiling the waters). Ruby and Carlos aren’t doomed by a single fatal flaw; instead, their love is exhausted by a series of minor disconnects, finally dying the death of a thousand cuts. “Fire Line Road” looks at incest and meth addiction as the normal, everyday, ghastly horrors that they are — exposing some of the ugliest dirt we’ve always swept under our societal rug. “Freeway View” is a honking, breakaway rock ’n’ roller propelled by Ian McLagan’s dazzling ivory-tickling while, according to James, the Dylanesque “Hurricane Party” inhabits “an old man cussing himself for what he misses and what he missed, occasionally noticing what’s happening now — it’s a reminiscence at the end of the world.” The moving set-closer “You’d a’ Thought (Leonard Cohen Must Die)” imbues its tale of a couple strained by individual weaknesses and stubborn old habits with a generosity of spirit and wry resignation. McMurtry says the parenthetical tag is there because “the lyrics kinda reminded me of a Cohen song, and I was still writing it while we were supposed to be recording it, and it just went on and on. So when I finally came up with it, I said ‘If it wasn’t for Leonard Cohen, you wouldn’t have had to spend half the day waiting on me.’” Listen at Last.fmWatch videos of James McMurtry playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!","<p><strong>James L.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/chelle-rose","Chelle Rose","LOUDON COUNTY TENNESSEE","country","CHELLE ROSE’S GHOST OF BROWDER HOLLER MEETS AT THE INTERSECTION OF APPALACHIAN ROCK AND COUNTRY Ray Wylie Hubbard-produced second album due out May 1, 2012 NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Hardscrabble Appalachia is known for its bluegrass, moonshine and coal mines. Now, with the May 1 arrival of gut-honest singer-songwriter Chelle Rose’s second album Ghost of Browder Holler (Lil’ Damsel Records, street date May 1, 2012), add visceral rock ’n’ roll to that list. Rose brings her elemental power to the 12-song disc produced by legendary Texas songsmith Ray Wylie Hubbard in Austin. And while those cuts, ripe with mystery and passion, sound like they were plucked from the kudzu-scented air of her native Loudon County in East Tennessee, they’re really written from life. “When I get homesick, I pine for Western North Carolina sometimes even more so than East Tennessee,” says Rose, who moved to Nashville in 1996. “My maternal family lives on both sides of the Smoky Mountains. I grew up there among the people I still know and love. I’ve always felt connected and consoled by the mountains and my people there, so writing about them comes very natural to me. There are many settings and characters rich for the mining.” The album’s opening track, “Browder Holler Boy,” is a perfect example. It kick-starts the set with a haunting slide guitar invocation and then spins a true tale of Rose’s first love, Timothy Andrew Helton, who died young in a canoeing accident, but returned to visit her as a noisy spirit. The tune also features Hubbard’s gritty supporting vocals and laid back harmonica. The heart of Rose’s close-to-the-bone sound — a driving approach she calls “Appalachian Rock n Roll” — thumps through the grinding, guitar-fueled “Alimony,” a playful but dead-serious account of the marriage she ended in order to attain her dream of becoming a songwriter and performer. There’s more than a hint of Exile on Main Street to “Rufus Morgan (Preacher Man),” which features legendary Faces keyboardist Ian “Mac” McLagan and Nashville’s leading spiritual singing family the McCrary Sisters. Rose wrote the song as a tribute to a rural holy man from her family tree, and its lyrics are a virtual tour of Western North Carolina’s richly forested land, where her “grannymom” often took her to visit other family members during childhood summers. Like the sweet and gravelly edges of Rose’s expressive voice, other songs echo the beauty and harshness of Appalachian life. “Leona Barnett,” written by her fellow East Tennessean Adam Hill, is the story of a woman driven to work in the mines after her husband is killed in a mining accident. And “Wild Violets Pretty,” which features Grammy-nominated Americana star Elizabeth Cook as guest vocalist, is about losing an unborn child. “Sometimes I can’t perform a song live until I’ve had time to heal from a deep wound, and often the healing begins with the song,” explains Rose. “I write a lot and don’t really look for material, so you know if I’m covering someone else’s song I am feeling it with every ounce of my soul.” Although this Appalachian wildflower didn’t get her first guitar until she was 25, music was always a deep part of her life. “My daddy was a piano player and so was his daddy,” she relates. Sherri King, her biological father’s first cousin, had some minor country hits in the ’70s, but had the distinction of writing, singing and playing on her own recordings — which made her a rare triple threat in Nashville’s good ole boys club. She was also a member of the legendary group Barefoot Jerry, a band of player’s players, and was a featured vocalist with Charlie McCoy’s band. “One of my first musical memories was sitting on my Granny Rose’s floor listening to Sherri’s second album and just running the needle over and over it,” she recalls. “I’d always sung and thought about maybe singing on a stage some day, but getting that guitar really woke something up in me,” Rose recounts. “I started listening to songwriters like Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Townes Van Zandt and my gut told me I was most likely not going to continue working in accounting.” So Rose relocated to Nashville in 1996 where she began seeing her inspirations in person. “As soon as I arrived I began ‘going to school’ to hear Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Buddy Miller, Malcolm Holcombe, R.B. Morris, David Olney and Marshall Chapman. They were just a few of my favorites and some of them have become friends and mentors. “When I moved from Knoxville to Nashville, Townes Van Zandt was at the top of my dream list of songwriters to hear live. I was devastated to hear of his passing in January 1997. I did however sit on a back church pew at his service, sad with regret that I would never get to hang with him. He played a huge part in my journey to become a songwriter.” Rose’s next step was making her debut recording. “Being at home and writing Nanahally River in the late ’90s with a baby on my hip seemed completely natural and just as important as the deep well of writers I was exposed to on the music scene at that time,” she says. Along with her mentor and musical kindred spirit David Hardman, Rose made her 2000 album Nanahally River in a basement studio. “Recording [it] was really casual with a lot of friends helping me out,” she says. “I paid J.D. Wilkes from the Legendary Shack*Shakers to play harmonica on Nanahally River by cooking him chicken n dumplins. I like to think that added to the magic.” Fast-forward 10 years. “More than a decade passed between albums because I was busy raising a family, but always writing when inspiration struck,” Rose continues. “I’ve never just sat down with a goal of writing a song. They just show up and I document them the best I can. Fate interceded in early fall of 2010 when I was snuggling with my daughter and had headphones on listening to Ray Wylie Hubbard do a live interview for Twisted South Radio. They asked him what he’d been listening to lately. He said, ‘Well, I’ve been listening to this songwriter from Nashville named Chelle Rose.’ I bolted up from the bed and heard him say he’d be interested in producing me. And the host, Zeke Loftin, who I had collaborated with on a charity event, said, ‘Chelle, if you’re listening you should call in.’ So I did, and I said, ‘You’re hired, let’s do it.’ A few weeks later I was off to Austin with my guitar and songs.” For Ghost of Browder Holler, Hubbard handpicked the players, who convened at engineer/bassist George Reiff’s Austin studio. “Every morning we’d sit at the kitchen table and pull one of my songs out of the hat,” Rose says. “Then we’d work out an arrangement and either agree or disagree to cut it. It was a beautiful, intense process that resulted in a record I’m so proud of.” That spontaneous approach — and the band playing all the basic tracks together in the studio — helped preserve the disc’s cohesive live vibe. “What’s in the tracks is some hard core blood, sweat and tears from myself and many talented musicians who were generous with their contributions to the arrangements and to the soul of this album,” Rose declares. “I tried to quit music, but it just wouldn’t quit me. I realized I need it like I need food, water, sleep and love. It’s not about chasing fame or any kind of fortune. It’s about a strong connection with who I am. I share my music because it creates a beautiful exchange of energy in my life. It most certainly is medicine for my own soul. If it has the same effect on others, then I’m blessed.” ### For more information about Chelle Rose, please contact Conqueroo: Cary Baker • (323) 656-1600 • cary@conqueroo.com","<p><span class=""caps"">CHELLE</span> ROSE’S <span class=""caps"">GHOST</span> OF <span class=""caps"">BROWDER</span> <span class=""caps"">HOLLER</span> <span class=""caps"">MEETS</span> AT <span class=""caps"">THE</span> <span class=""caps"">INTERSECTION</span> OF <span class=""caps"">APPALACHIAN</span> <span class=""caps"">ROCK</span> <span class=""caps"">AND</span> <span class=""caps"">COUNTRY</span></p> <p>Ray Wylie Hubbard-produced second album due out May 1, 2012</p> <p><span class=""caps"">NASHVILLE</span>, Tenn. – Hardscrabble Appalachia is known for its bluegrass, moonshine and coal mines.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/high-highs","High Highs","Brooklyn, NY","indie, singer-songwriter, acoustic, dream pop","Widely tipped as “indie darlings” and a “band to watch” on the strength of an acclaimed EP, some high profile film and TV placements, and a series of hypnotic live shows, High Highs are set to deliver on their early promise with a debut LP in late January 2013. Critics have embraced the four-track High Highs EP as “simply spun and exquisitely enthralling,” and singer Jack Milas’ falsetto as a “weapon of mass emotional destruction.” Milas and co-founder Oli Chang create an “unholy” blend of acoustic-guitar textures and synthesized atmospherics. The band’s signature sound has struck the blogosphere as “shimmering” and “stunning” “sun-kissed sadness.” High Highs kicks off with “Flowers Bloom,” with its “delicate synth soundscapes [and] haunting vocal harmonies.” It also features the “sweeping” “folk-pop” of the single “Open Season,” the “gorgeous” “Ivy,” and “Horses” – which has drawn multiple favourable blog comparisons to Neil Young. Milas and Chang began making music together as High Highs in their native Sydney, Australia, while working at the same recording studio. Chang was in another band at the time, but found himself drawn to Milas’ writing style. The pair plunged into a world of collaboration and invention. They discovered the basis of a band aesthetic by marrying Chang’s passion for electronic indie with Jack’s penchant for classic acoustic rock. “There’s obviously a lot of scope for what you can do with a laptop and a keyboard,” Chang explained. “It’s more straightforward which palettes of sound work with acoustic guitar, drums, and voice. That helps narrow it down a bit.” Lead vocals were a responsibility Milas initially was tempted to shirk. “I just had so little confidence in my voice,” he confessed, “and singing in falsetto was the only way I knew how to get any vague vibe out of it.” Chang concurred. “Singing in falsetto, you don’t have to be confronted with yourself,” he said. “Your speaking voice is you. With falsetto, you can become someone else. You don’t have to deal with listening to yourself.” When Milas took an opportunity to work and live in New York, Chang soon followed. The duo settled in Brooklyn, re-committed to making High Highs music, and joined forces with drummer Zach Lipkins – who is also handling mixing duties on the forthcoming LP. “It’s awesome that Zach is a really talented producer as well as a great drummer, especially because a lot of the time the drum arrangements are really minimal and heartbeat-like. He knows how to ride a gentle dynamic wave.” Live gigs presented the trio with a new set of musical challenges. “We had to figure out ways to get this delicate, soft music to have impact in a live kind of atmosphere,” Milas said. “We’d be going on after a heavy metal band, or a synthy pop-rock thing, and it was like we had to match that in scale, create a big sound, and cut through the noise. We realised there has to be scale and dynamics to the performance, within its small intimacy, because if it’s all too quiet and hushed and atmospheric, it doesn’t engage us or the listeners.” High Highs played well-received gigs to expanding audiences in New York – including a packed residency at Pianos on New York’s Lower East Side – and in London to a sold out crowd at the Old Queen’s Head. Their widescreen sound meanwhile attracted the attention of college radio programmers and music supervisors alike – which landed a coveted slot in ABC’s taste-making Grey’s Anatomy, another in the hit film Pitch Perfect, and another in a heavily-rotated spot for the Amazon Kindle. The band’s debut long player will feature EP favourites “Open Season” and “Flowers Bloom,” live standouts “Once Around The House” and “Phone Call,” and more brand new songs. Tour dates around the release date will be announced in late 2012.","<p>Widely tipped as “indie darlings” and a “band to watch” on the strength of an acclaimed EP, some high profile film and TV placements, and a series of hypnotic live shows, High Highs are set to deliver on their early promise with a debut LP in late January 2013.</p> <p>Critics have embraced the four-track High Highs EP as “simply spun and exquisitely enthralling,” and singer Jack Milas’ falsetto as a “weapon of mass emotional destruction.” Milas and co-founder Oli Chang create an “unholy” blend of acoustic-guitar textures and synthesized atmospherics. The band’s signature sound has struck the blogosphere as “shimmering” and “stunning” “sun-kissed sadness.”</p> <p>High Highs kicks off with “Flowers Bloom,” with its “delicate synth soundscapes [and] haunting vocal harmonies.” It also features the “sweeping” “folk-pop” of the single “Open Season,” the “gorgeous” “Ivy,” and “Horses” – which has drawn multiple favourable blog comparisons to Neil Young.</p> <p>Milas and Chang began making music together as High Highs in their native Sydney, Australia, while working at the same recording studio. Chang was in another band at the time, but found himself drawn to Milas’ writing style. The pair plunged into a world of collaboration and invention. They discovered the basis of a band aesthetic by marrying Chang’s passion for electronic indie with Jack’s penchant for classic acoustic rock.</p> <p>“There’s obviously a lot of scope for what you can do with a laptop and a keyboard,” Chang explained. “It’s more straightforward which palettes of sound work with acoustic guitar, drums, and voice. That helps narrow it down a bit.”</p> <p>Lead vocals were a responsibility Milas initially was tempted to shirk. “I just had so little confidence in my voice,” he confessed, “and singing in falsetto was the only way I knew how to get any vague vibe out of it.” Chang concurred. “Singing in falsetto, you don’t have to be confronted with yourself,” he said. “Your speaking voice is you. With falsetto, you can become someone else. You don’t have to deal with listening to yourself.”</p> <p>When Milas took an opportunity to work and live in New York, Chang soon followed. The duo settled in Brooklyn, re-committed to making High Highs music, and joined forces with drummer Zach Lipkins – who is also handling mixing duties on the forthcoming LP. “It’s awesome that Zach is a really talented producer as well as a great drummer, especially because a lot of the time the drum arrangements are really minimal and heartbeat-like. He knows how to ride a gentle dynamic wave.”</p> <p>Live gigs presented the trio with a new set of musical challenges. “We had to figure out ways to get this delicate, soft music to have impact in a live kind of atmosphere,” Milas said. “We’d be going on after a heavy metal band, or a synthy pop-rock thing, and it was like we had to match that in scale, create a big sound, and cut through the noise. We realised there has to be scale and dynamics to the performance, within its small intimacy, because if it’s all too quiet and hushed and atmospheric, it doesn’t engage us or the listeners.”</p> <p>High Highs played well-received gigs to expanding audiences in New York – including a packed residency at Pianos on New York’s Lower East Side – and in London to a sold out crowd at the Old Queen’s Head.

Battleme is Matt Drenik, an artist who grew up surrounded by music and found himself at a crossroads in 2009. After fronting the Austin, TX rock band, Lions, he was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease known as uveitis. His vision was in question. With no known cause and no known cure, Drenik’s writing began to change. His new songs bended genres, never allowing them to be categorized. He fell back in love with childhood records such as The Flaming Lips’ “Clouds Taste Metallic” and Beck’s “Mellow Gold.” He started to find a singular voice in these songs, a voice with no boundaries. He decided to call the project Battleme. Wanting a change, Drenik moved to Portland, OR in the summer of 2010. He wrote over 40 songs in his basement. A handful of songs got in the hands of Thomas Turner of Ghostland Observatory who offered Drenik a deal on his label, Trashy Moped Recordings. With Turner signed on to produce, the two lived and breathed the songs for the next six months. The result is a sprawling mix of post-modern rock and soul — powerful hooks, bottom heavy grooves, and ethereal textures blended effortlessly with drifting, falsetto vocals.

While it’s not particularly happy music, it’s not particularly dark either. The song is paced like a typical track from The Killers and strings along the basic “you are, you’re breaking my heart” type story. Like early ’80s post-punk, it’s partially meant to make you dance and partially meant to make you sulk. The debut album from New Roman Times is one of those that remind us the music of the ’80s never really goes away. There will always be bands whose John Hughes movie melody in hindsight will remind us how cool of a time that decade was. Currently based out of Austin, New Roman Times is lead by Daniel Owens on vocals and guitar. Providing the seductive backing vocals (some of the best moments on the album) is the pretty girl bassist Josie Fluri. The band is rounded out with Mike Allen on drums and Harris Thurmond on guitar and synths. Even the second track’s title suggests the days of cassette tapes and lip gloss. “VCR” is also one many moments during On the Sleeve that will give the listener a vision of Interpol — that is minus Paul Banks doing his Ian Curtis impression. Lyrically it does make a darker turn from the opener. “And as the sun rolls on we will never belong to this bitter age,” Owens resentfully sings before Fluri’s faint voice joins him for, “But to what we are, someone else.” Paranoia, new wave guitars, and echoing vocals collide for one of the albums highlights. Those elements reappear in “Belle De Jour;” a love song to a mystery woman who “walks alone in the city after dark, reaching out for love.” Fluri’s quiet vocal is strongly utilized as the ghost voice of the song’s title character and adds a haunting effect to emphasize the theme. The rapid drum breakdown at the bridge builds tension and provides sufficient movement. The remainder of On the Sleeve doesn’t stray far from the working formula. “West End World” sports a catchy hook and amped synths. “Secret and Lies” benefits from the dual harmony of Owens and Fluri opening the song. The closer “Young Hearts” has the lead man donning the tortured soul by going with a spoken vocal for his verses. While not breaking any barriers, New Roman Times still built an album that can be listened from beginning to end without the need to skip around. It plays like good driving music. Much like The Killers, Interpol, White Lies and other post-punk/new wave revivalists, the tunes of New Roman Times can send you dancing to the rhythm or soul searching through the lyrics. On the Sleeve is a solid effort that warrants solid attention. -Stereo Subversion -August 2009","<p> </p> <p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 12.0px Verdana;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.0px;"">“Smoke in Your Disguise” opens up On the Sleeve in all its new wave glory.

RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, Otha Turner and their musical families were at their peak touring the world, making classic records, and doing the all-night boogie at Jr’s Juke Joint and Otha’s BBQ Goat picnics — the music and the culture rich as the black Mississippi dirt. We used to drive down wide-eyed and open-eared to watch and listen to these giants among men, the kings of the hills playing their music with their people for their people. The musical traditions passing from generation to generation. Down at Otha’s we used to boogie in the dirt, dust, and gravel. Old ladies teachin’ the young girls how to shake ‘em on down. The sweaty walls of Jr’s Juke Joint used to vibrate and amplify the all night long moonshine madness. The corn liquor inspired a very unique psychedelic trance blues. The multi-generational musical families gave the old-field hollers a very aggressive, loud edge, modern, electric, country blues.

RL Burnside, Junior Kimbrough, Otha Turner and their musical families were at their peak touring the world, making classic records, and doing the all-night boogie at Jr’s Juke Joint and Otha’s <span class=""caps"">BBQ</span> Goat picnics — the music and the culture rich as the black Mississippi dirt. <br> <br>We used to drive down wide-eyed and open-eared to watch and listen to these giants among men, the kings of the hills playing their music with their people for their people. The musical traditions passing from generation to generation. Down at Otha’s we used to boogie in the dirt, dust, and gravel. Old ladies teachin’ the young girls how to shake ‘em on down. The sweaty walls of Jr’s Juke Joint used to vibrate and amplify the all night long moonshine madness. The corn liquor inspired a very unique psychedelic trance blues. The multi-generational musical families gave the old-field hollers a very aggressive, loud edge, modern, electric, country blues. Young, outsider musicians couldn’t just hang out and hide in the corner, you had to play. It felt like it was an insult not to. The elder’s requesting you to play their own songs.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/action-bronson-","Action Bronson","Queens, NY","hip-hop, underground hip-hop, new york","A raunchy, cylinder-shaped ginger of Eastern European ancestry might not be the first dude you’d peg for rap stardom, but that’s exactly the mantle Action Bronson is on the verge of possessing. Over the last two years, the 28-year old Queens native has become one of hip-hop’s most charismatic and colorful new characters, thanks to his wicked sense of humor, a buffet of impressive releases and the rare knack for updating cherished East Coast aesthetics into indisputably modern music. Last year, The New York Times hailed Bronson as “one of the most promising prospects in New York hip-hop.” That formidable potential is now being realized. When Bronson gleefully tossed slabs of meat from Peter Luger’s famed steakhouse into a wild-ass crowd at the Music Hall of Williamsburg, the mosh pit of skaters, knuckleheads, rap purists and young women was evidence of his ever-widening appeal. Born Ariyan Arslani, Bronson grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, the son of an Albanian immigrant father and a Jewish mother from Brooklyn. He was an only child, but the population of the two-bedroom apartment swelled to as many as 13 inhabitants due to cousins, aunts, uncles and refuges from ethnic strife in Kosovo. It was in the family restaurant that Bronson developed his enduring fascination with quality eating. After studying in the Art Institute of New York’s culinary program, he took jobs ranging from busboy to sous chef. Consequently, songs in his discography often read like menu items: “Roasted Bone Marrow,” “Pouches of Tuna,” “Jerk Chicken,” “Ceviche.” Rolling Stone, appreciating the theme, described Bronson’s music as “the ultimate in comfort food, with a contemporary twist.” While Bronson was a ravenous musical connoisseur who grew up admiring artists like Kool G. Rap, Cam’ron and Mobb Deep, he never contemplated rapping himself. But a few years back, he penned a satirical song over a Southern beat CD and the results were improbably impressive. With an oversized personality, intricate wordplay and the cagy charm of an outer-borough striver, he was a natural. And after a broken leg forced him out of the kitchen, Bronson began writing seriously. In 2007, joined with Mayhem Lauren and Jay Steele to release the Last of a Dyin’ Breed: Volume 1 mixtape under the collective name “The Outdoorsmen.” Bronson’s insistent delivery and penchant for flamboyant phraseology initially drew some comparisons to Ghostface, but he has long since matured beyond such superficialities. In 2011 alone, he released Bon Appetit… Bitch!, The Program EP, Dr. Lecter and Well Done. 2012 introduced collaborations with artists like Earl Sweatshirt, Riff Raff and SpaceGhostPurp, as well as Blue Chips, the brilliant street album produced by Party Supplies. In awarding the effort a lofty 8.1, Pitchfork called Bronson “one of the most hilarious and creative writers in rap” who savagely captured the essence of New York’s seedy soul: “It is what a Weegee photograph would look like now.” In August of 2012, Bronson signed with Vice/Warner Bros Records. With the leading youth media company’s multi-platform power now backing him, forthcoming projects like Rare Chandeliers with Alchemist, Saab Story with Harry Fraud and Blue Chips 2 will find countless new listeners. His debut LP on Vice/Warner Bros. Music is scheduled for 2013. For Action Bronson, this accelerating rise to greatness may just persuade him to put off “laying back, eating poutine” for a little while longer.","<div>A raunchy, cylinder-shaped ginger of Eastern European ancestry might not be the first dude you’d peg for rap stardom, but that’s exactly the mantle Action Bronson is on the verge of possessing.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/flying-lotus","Flying Lotus","WINNETKA, California, US","electronica, hip-hop, electronic, experimental","Flying Lotus’ albums are events. They’re not issued with a mechanic regularity and they don’t subscribe to recognized formulae. For those prone to astral traveling and metaphysical introspection they are another piece of the puzzle. For those, let’s say more ‘conventional’ listeners, the records are grand and ghostly sweeping movements – the sort of which are rarely undertaken at present. For being such a potent strain of future-thinking music, the scope of Flying Lotus’ full-lengths recall the ambition and vision of many older masters while at the same time look unflinchingly towards the beyond. As the psychic ripples caused by Flying Lotus’ Cosmogramma are still felt, the ground broken by its larger-than-life presence has proven to be very fertile soil indeed. That opus illustrated the universe that Flying Lotus inhabited, one in which Californian psychedelic gurus bumped elbows with Radiohead while the synthesizers were tuned to the strains of outré soul jams and the orchestra was conducted by the psilocybin-assisted movements of the deepest free-jazz nomads. From the neon afterglow of this ‘space-opera’ would come the vapor trails leading to FlyLo’s next revelation. Until The Quiet Comes. Composed, according to Flying Lotus, as “a collage of mystical states, dreams, sleep and lullabies” the album has the distinct feel of this nocturnal trip. From the twitching descent into a subconscious state and the out-of-focus time ether of the journey that follows, the sound is an unhinged, yet elegant evolution of the melodic and rhythmic interplay that is woven into the DNA of Flying Lotus’ aural personae. The meeting between earthy cosmic bass weight and computerized arrangements has never been more intertwined in this music than it is here, which not only speaks to an exponential growth as a producer and composer, but also the deeper conceptual flourishes at the foundation of the songs here. And of course the extended family is involved here, and has even grown significantly. Longtime muses of FlyLo, Niki Randa and Laura Darlington both return and remind us why they’re such cherished vocal collaborators – because few people can match the controlled and beautiful chaos of Flying Lotus’s productions with the same air of grace. Thom Yorke also returns to the fold with a sublime contribution to the digital free jazz of ‘Electric Candyman’ as does Thundercat (in addition to his cosmic bass-playing across the album) on the saucer-eyed ‘DMT Song’, which already has the trappings of a soul anthem for a new generation of psychedelic explorers. Of course, the Flying Lotus family tree has extended as well, and into the mix comes the inimitable queen of leftfield R&B herself, Erykah Badu – who’s turn on the epic rumble of ‘See Thru To U’ is one of many highlights. Flying Lotus is the center of a musical web that stretches far from the vibrant sprawl of Los Angeles, and joins so many like-minded individuals – whether it’s Earl Sweatshirt joining him on-stage at Coachella this year, fellow Oddfuture oddball Hodgy Beats collaborating on mixtapes or FlyLo spending some serious studio time with Black Hippy’s inimitable SchoolBoyQ. All this stylistic mingling and genre-melting from Flying Lotus has contributed significantly to shift music in a direction that once again prizes cohesive artistic statements and conceptual depth. However, he makes these intellectual leaps without forsaking the all-important heft of a bassline or unimpeded ‘swing’ of a drum beat – the same way so many masters of soul music have infused their songs for lovers and dancers with brilliant and heady subtext for decades. Until The Quiet Comes follows this tradition while clearing a path distinctly it’s own, which is a mark of a classic. “Quiet is relative for this antsy L.A. based producer, who convenes Thom Yorke, Erykah Badu and a rushing data stream for a stoned soul-jazz picnic.” – Rolling Stone, Best Dance Albums of 2012 “[Flying Lotus’] fourth album, Until the Quiet Comes, is, like its predecessors, a drop down a rabbit hole of moods, built with electronic instrumentation, hip-hop-inspired rhythms and jazzy tonal structures.” – NPR, Top 50 Albums of 2012 “It’s a twitchy, brooding digital dystopia stripped of any lyrical agenda so all that remains is a mood of restless agitation.” – The Guardian, #19 Best Album of 2012","<p>Flying Lotus’ albums are events.

He began songwriting at age 12. The following year, he started a band called Flood, who covered Creed and 311 and sold homemade cassettes to classmates. In high school, heavily influenced by Elvis Costello and The Cars, Dent fronted a power-pop band called The Rockwells. Feeling like an outsider in Mississippi, he retreated to the Internet, where he spent his time soaking in pop music and culture from around the globe. After dropping out of NYU film school, Dent founded Oxford, Mississippi’s self-proclaimed “infotainment cult” Cats Purring. Since then, his musical endeavors have included a debut LP of ukulele tunes on Paw Tracks, dance recordings under the Dent Sweat moniker, and a mysterious unfinished psych-country rock opera called Cowboy Maloney’s Electric City. He throws notorious DIY shows at his home, a former Boys & Girls club now deemed the Cats Purring Dude Ranch. Recent singles on Forest Family and Paw Tracks have found Dent abandoning the ukulele in favor of cosmic synths, funky guitars, analog drum machines, loopy bass lines, and massive vocal harmonies. He played all the instruments on his new album Do Things, which was recorded at the Dude Ranch and in a friend’s rural cabin by a cotton field. Do Things will be released by Paw Tracks on June 12, 2012.","<p><span style=""font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"">Dent May writes <br /> and records homemade pop music in Mississippi, where he was born in <br /> 1985.

Formed in 2006 by Marc Voorhees (guitar), Cory Plump (bass), Nate Cross (guitar), Brandon Crowe (drums), Jesse Hodges (vocals), Daniel Francis Doyle (drums) and George Dishner (vocals). Jeff Swanson (drums) of Austin band Gorch Fock is also known to have played when savant soloist Doyle is touring on his own. Many have said WDRTE were vomited out of the Austin scene because of their various affiliations with other vomit inspired bands. Dinos are made up of members of the following Oh! Beast, Awesome Cool Dudes, Tuxedo Killers, The Dakota Building, Pterodactyl, Twin Powers, Expensive Shit, Daniel Francis Doyle, Shit and Shine, Los Laundry Boys and Wessa DJs (the original Jar Jar Binks DJ duo). Their favorite words: clouds, meisters, doggies, pups, brew pups, noiice, noiiiiice, not noiice, nn, n, total meisters, horns up, horns down, no ice, slump busters, wait…what, fritters, beasts and machines. Their debut album Snacks was released by the Emperor Jones Recording Group (also home of The Rebel, Rusted Shut, KB Da Kidnappa & Pip Proud). Their second album NOT NOIICE was released on the Chalk Circle imprint. Listen at Last.fmLocal sevenpiece When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth is beyond definition. Crash bam boom. Pop metal noise. Start stop holler. Whatever. The Tuxedo Killers-Awesome Cool Dudes combo is loud, jittery, and – get this – completely in control. Where most noise bands spit and sputter above a staccato guitar spurt, Dinos play with time changes, melody, and power. Don't let opening number ""Glee Club"" fool you, either. These aren't well-behaved boys. That becomes apparent as soon as George Dishner's percussive vox drives into ""1-2-3 Pissmop."" Where his volume ends, Jesse Hodges' creepy melody begins. The two vocalists combine with dual guitar attack, bass, and double drummers Daniel Francis Doyle and Brandon Crowe. ""Let's All Get Fades"" presents that metal-pop cocktail with a PBR chaser, but ""Saturday Morning Caveman"" investigates structure a bit more: ""That's just how we roll."" Sure, some silliness is involved (""The Triumphant Spirit of the Olympics,"" the sticky sweet ""Los Laundry Boys"") and even some psych-metal wankery (closer ""Bananafana""), but Dinos' Snacks is a bit of mad-scientist brilliance put through monster amps.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/st-paul-and-the-broken-bones","St. Paul and the Broken Bones","Birmingham,AL","","Paul is a young man who began wailing straight out of the womb, and most folks would agree that he hasn’t stopped since. “Oh what a set of lungs that child has,” they’d say, “he must be destined for something special.” Not wishing to disappoint, and being a good young southern boy, Paul began singing in church, stretching those vocal cords with an eye toward becoming a man of the cloth. As it turns out, however, the cloth didn’t appreciate young Paul’s affinity for dirty jokes, Prince, and Tom Waits, and he was inclined to search elsewhere for co-conspirators.

As it turns out, however, the cloth didn’t appreciate young Paul’s affinity for dirty jokes, Prince, and Tom Waits, and he was inclined to search elsewhere for co-conspirators.

Perfectly coupled. Ben’s songwriting is as bold in range as it is in ferocity. Fueled by a quality of melodrama and powerful lyricism, it’s the romance and the manhood crashing with his voice that gives Caplan a truly innovative and experimental artistry. A sound that bridges the gap between controlled composition and unruly passion. Striding in pace with gypsy-inspired strings amid the sultry tones of clarinet and saxophone, Caplan has marked his place in the Canadian music landscape with a growling spirit similar to that of Tom Waits. Caplan’s tours have extended throughout the Commonwealth, the rhapsodic energy in his live show an elegant cacophony gaining attention around the world. Breaking between guitar, banjo, piano, and melodica, Caplan’s stage show is almost reminiscent of a burly and bearded Freddy Mercury; a raging, strong, and exploratory songwriter, it’s the blues in his soul, and the heart in your chest pounding as one that makes Ben Caplan & The Casual Smokers an act not to be missed. Ben Caplan has been a touring musician for the past five years. Seasoned in coast-to-coast travel, Caplan his seen stages in the UK and has performed at a rolodex of festivals. What People Have Said About The Casual Smokers: Stephanie Domet, CBC Radio1 – Atlantic Airwaves: “Ben understands that in this business it’s not enough to just climb on stage and sing songs. You need to be an entertainer as well. You need to entertain and engage the audience – and that he does in spades…. Keep an ear on Ben. You’ll be hearing more from him, I’m sure!” Bryan Acker, Herohill.com “Caplan and his talented band – The Casual Smokers – will undoubtedly garner review after review build around on his voice, but even when they deliver the roughtest of bar room stomps, there is a surprising depth and musicianship to the songs… Caplan and the Casual Smokers stand out from the masses influenced by the same sounds.” Craig Norris, Host CBC Radio 3: “I really like your stuff. And now I want everyone out there to hear your stuff… it’s kind of rough around the edges, has a real sort of bar room, salooney, Tom Waits vibe to it; wicked playing, and great delivery. I cannot wait until the full length real record comes out.” Slowcoustic.com: I don’t pretend to have known Ben Caplan for years but damn it after this video from his Green Couch Session, I wish I did. While his day job with “Ben Caplan & the Casual Smokers” is not quite as stripped down and acoustic as the below video, if you are looking for slightly bluesy, jazzy, folky tunes – you should check them out! Amelia Curran, Singer-Songwriter: “He’s like Freddy Mercury meets Mr. Bungle” Peter Katz, Singer-Songwriter: “More like Freddy Mercury meets God!” Paul Cram, Bandleader, Producer, Improviser, Musician: I played with Ben Caplan and the Casual Smokers the other night and It was great fun. I love the energy of their minor slinky music, cause it’s bendable and makes you wanna wail.. It was also a nice surprise to play with a “horn section” improvising around arrangements for violin, Cello and winds on solid songwriting that could take the punishment and throw it back: Klezmer/Torch Balkan Jazz/Folk/…anyone? Joe Bigda-Peyton, Psychology Major: Although still able to recognize fear-evoking facial expressions, there is a clear indication that Ben Caplan has experienced some damage to his anterior and possibly even posterior amygdale. Joe Girard, Expert: “The music of Ben Caplan is the cure for diarrhea, malaria, and malignant ennui! Third world nation’s rejoice!”","<p>Rugged, raspy, and roaring with charisma, Halifax’s Ben Caplan & The Casual Smokers is to folklore what smoke is to bourbon. Perfectly coupled.

Home to a prolific but unsung underground music community, it is a city that keeps its secrets, but over the past few years Royal Bangs have become a hard secret to keep. Under Royal Bangs and various other guises, frontman Ryan Schaefer, drummer Chris Rusk, and guitarist Sam Stratton have been making music together since their high school days. In 2006, they unleashed their home-recorded and self-released breakthrough album We Breed Champions. The record’s potent noise-pop wormed its way into hearts throughout the southeastern US, eventually finding its way to Patrick Carney (The Black Keys), who reissued We Breed Champions on his own Audio Eagle Records in May of 2008. In the meantime, Royal Bangs went on hiatus as Schaefer spent a year in France, soaking up Euro dance music and entitlement culture as inspiration for the early stages of a follow-up. After Schaefer’s return to the States, the band used the promotion of their brand-new, two-year old record as an opportunity to refine their live performance. The result was an incessant touring schedule, including stops at Bonnaroo, SXSW, and a series of shows opening for The Black Keys in the fall of 2008.In February of 2009, on the eve of City Slang’s well-received European release of We Breed Champions, Royal Bangs traveled to Tangerine Sound Studios in Akron, Ohio to record their long-awaited sophomore album. The resulting Let It Beep, released on Audio Eagle in September 2009, finds the band’s sound looking more than ever in two seemingly conflicting directions: an increased emphasis on the electronic — from spastic, syrup-thick synths to dancy drum programming — coupled with earnest echoes of fervid 70s rock legends like Springsteen and Thin Lizzy. But the core of their sound, rooted in the indie rock renaissance and Schaefer’s hook-heavy arrangements, embraces both tendencies without allowing them to diverge, resulting in an album that might be described as both challenging and accessible if not for the phrase “pure goddamn fun.” With a third album in the works, Royal Bangs continue to tour within an easy day’s drive of your home.Watch videos of Royal Bangs playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!","<p>Royal Bangs are three electric gents from Knoxville, Tennessee, sentinel of the Smoky Mountains.

With only one EP and two singles released in their own founded Brennnessel label, the three-piece band were immediately credited as one of Poland’s best export products, being featured in music press, prime-time radio playlists and playing tons of energetic, often sold-out club and festival gigs in Poland, and some of the most important global music events such as SXSW, Great Escape or Exit Festival. In September 2011 Kamp! released their first international single “Cairo” in the portuguese label Discotexas. The release, which included Beatport top ten remix by Moullinex, has been critically acclaimed by countless music writers, blogs and musicians (the original song opened one of The Magician’s famous mixtapes) around the globe.

Plastic monkeys! These are among the pop-culture artifacts that appear in the epilepsy-inducing slideshow video for “Hurricane,” the first single from MS MR. Until recently shrouded in anonymity, the atmospheric indie-pop duo from New York City has proven universally intriguing, earning breathless attention from Pitchfork, Forbes, and Perez Hilton alike.In the trip-hoppy “Hurricane,” smoky-voiced Lizzy Plapinger sings, “Welcome to the inner workings of my mind/So dark and foul I can’t disguise,” while a push-and-pull of echoey strings and staccato percussion (courtesy of the producer stylings of Ms Mr other half Max Hershenow) envelop her voice. Technically, the song, which hit No. 1 on Hype Machine, is about Hurricane Irene, which careened towards Gotham last year. The video? Not so much.“I see something different every time I watch it,” concedes Max. “The video is sort of a cross section of the images we’ve collected on Tumblr, which we essentially use as an ongoing mood board.” If there’s one philosophy driving MS MR (pronounced “miss mister”) —dabblers in chaos theory who’re as goofy as they are thoughtful—it’s media-theorist Marshall McLuhan’s famous observation that the medium is the message. MS MR are so committed to that sentiment they handpicked each “Hurricane” image themselves.“We’re interested in exploring the nature of mixed media and collage,” says Lizzy, “and how music transcends all these various platforms.” Chief among them: MS MR’s lively—if thoroughly mystifying—Tumblr page, which they unprecedentedly used to debut their second EP, the critically acclaimed Candy Bar Creep Show, song-by-song. (Their first release, Ghost City USA, was a self-released collection of demos.)The EP, which sets the foundation for MS MR’s still-untitled album (out early next spring), references everything from ’80s to’90s pop, doo-wop to country. That kitchen-sink aesthetic won the attention of vintage-sound wiz Tom Elmhirst (Adele, Amy Winehouse), who mixed and did some additional production on it at the legendary Electric Lady Studios. “Tom helped us more fully realize the album as we imagined it” says Max. “He responds to music more emotionally and viscerally than anyone I’ve ever met. It was the perfect match.”The aural Jenga that is MS MR was born of Lizzy and Max’s vast inspirations. “We both listen to a lot of different music from all different genres and time periods,” says Max. “So we like to approach each song as its own project and experiment with combining unexpected elements.”It’s a stroke of serendipity that Lizzy and Max are even making music together. They may giggle uncontrollably and complete each other’s thoughts, but these Vassar alums never really knew each other during college. Lizzy was a media-studies major, releasing records under her burgeoning imprint Neon Gold. (She’s gone on to release records by artists such as Passion Pit and Ellie Goulding.) Max was an urban-studies major with a concentration in modern dance, and started composing music for his choreographies. They met fleetingly through friends. But really connected after they graduated, when Lizzy needed an unbiased sounding board for her secret project, and Max was looking for new artists to collaborate with.“There was sort of an element of Internet dating to it,” Max says, laughing. “Throw caution to the wind! Send someone an email, hope for the best.” He liked what he heard, which only terrified Lizzy more. “I was nervous because I had never sung in front of anyone before, so when he told me he was interested I actually put it off for a few months.”They finally connected three months later in December 2010. To find their footing as collaborators, they recorded a sweeping cover of Patrick Wolf’s “Time of My Life” in Max’s closet-turned-studio. Curious to see where else the music could take them, they decided to give it another go and try their hand at some original material. This led to the swelling, mercurial tune we know now as “Bones.“ ”It’s quite a personal song and definitely set a tone for the band,"" says Lizzy. “In person, we’re quite upbeat and bubbly, but the music is a much more honest space and outlet for us.""Only now, it’s become public. MS MR finally unveiled their live personae in March with a rocked-out gig at Brooklyn’s respected Glasslands Gallery. “I think people maybe expected two people on stage with a laptop, but we were adamant from the beginning that we would never do that!” says Lizzy. “We wanted the live show to do the recoded tracks justice,” continues Max, “so we perform as a band to give it the lushness and energy we aim for while recording.” Since their Glasslands show, they’ve moved on to bigger venues while touring with Marina and the Diamonds, an outing they affectionately refer to as their ""training-wheels tour.”“Really,” continues Max, “this whole experience has been about discovering undiscovered parts of ourselves.""","<p>Edward Scissorhands.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/lusine","Lusine","Seattle, WA","dj, electronica, electronic, ambient, idm","Lusine — aka Seattle-based producer Jeff McIlwain — recently announced the arrival of The Waiting Room, his third full-length under the moniker Lusine, for a February 19th release on Ghostly International (his first album since 2009’s A Certain Distance). The first single was the infectious “Another Tomorrow” which originally hit Pitchfork & saw another remix from Hanssen(following Jon Convex’s remix of the same track), who creates a slow-buildling, atmospheric take on the original. Clash Music recently premiered the remix here. Both remixes are included on theAnother Tomorrow single, out this week on Ghostly as well. Additionally, Lusine has announced a handful of tour dates for March that will be taking him to the SXSW festival in Austin, as well as dates in Brooklyn, Chicago, San Francisco, Toronto,and others. Full list of dates can be found below. McIlwain’s work has long inhabited the fertile border zone between electronic pop and experimental electronic music — it’s a place that’s home to music that has both a brain and a heart, and McIlwain’s been exploring its boundaries for the best part of a decade now.As with all McIlwain’s work as Lusine, The Waiting Room is a record that’s characterized by both diversity and coherency. Its other tracks traverse a variety of sonic landscapes as well, from the widescreen atmospherics of appropriately-titled opening track “Panoramic” through the digital soul arrangement of Electronic’s “Get the Message” and the club-friendly bounce of “First Call” to the slow-building Detroit-inflected closer “February”.But for all The Waiting Room‘s eclecticism, it’s also notable that it plays out as a coherent whole, with McIlwain’s deft production creating the sense of a single, logical journey — an album, rather than a simple collection of tracks. It also continues the excursions into vocal-led tracks that characterized A Certain Distance — exactly half of The Waiting Room‘s ten tracks employ vocalists, most notably the aforementioned “Get the Message,” wherein guest vocalist and sister Sarah McIlwain makes Bernard Sumner’s words her own: “I don’t know where to begin / Living in sin,” she sings calmly, “How can you talk? / Look where you’ve been.”As a whole, this is an album that’s both cerebral and visceral, a record that’s both rewarding of a serious headphone session and also warm and melodic enough to make listening as engaging in an emotional sense as it is in an intellectual one. Many artists flirt with these two extremities of electronic music; few tie them together as well as McIlwain does.Lusine Press PageLusine Ghostly International PageFacebookTerrorbird Media","<p><strong>Lusine</strong> — aka Seattle-based producer Jeff McIlwain — recently announced the arrival of <strong><em>The Waiting Room</em></strong>, his third full-length under the moniker <strong>Lusine</strong>, for a <strong>February 19th release on Ghostly International</strong> (his first album since 2009’s <strong><em>A Certain Distance</em>)</strong>.

As the creator of one of the year’s most buzz-worthy independent releases, the 26 year-old Nashville native successfully showcased his unique ability to blend multiple genres into a singular dance floor groove. The son of renowned Jazz trumpeter, Gary “El Buho” Gazaway, the producer’s culturally diverse upbringing is reflected in his nuanced, multilayered instrumental arrangements. With a process the LA Times describes as “drawing a different design within a similar framework”, Gazaway’s cleverly executed remix/mashup projects gives audiences a familiar, yet fresh and distinct way to experience their favorite songs. The producer’s first full-length instrumental album, Selective Hearing Vol. 1, was released in 2010 on the Cold Busted label founded by veteran dance DJ, Vitamin D. Charting on Beatport’s top selling Chill-Out sales chart, the album introduced listeners to Gazaway’s tasteful use of samples and unique knack for combining diverse sounds into something completely new and original. While studying Digital Media at MTSU, Gazaway and fellow producer Wally Clark co-hosted the popular “Gummy Soul Show” on the now defunct Nashville radio station WRVU. The program, which featured rare 60’s and 70’s soul eventually morphed into a boutique record label co-owned and operated by the two former radio hosts. The label’s inaugural release came in the form of Kurtis Stanley’s – Gummy Soul album- a release for which Gazaway contributed production and established a heavy involvement in the label’s video production, album artwork/graphics, and web design. In 2011, Roots’ drummer Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson hit town with a per-announced DJ set at a local Nashville nightclub. Seeing the opportunity, Amerigo posed as a photojournalist, gained access to the club’s backstage area and cleverly slipped Questlove a copy of his just finished Fela Kuti/De La Soul mashup fusion, Fela Soul. Thompson, an avid afrobeat/native tongues fan called the album “brilliant” and published it to his website, Okayplayer. Quickly spreading to other outlets, the album made MTV Hive, The Source and BoingBoing before taking top 5 rankings on both NPR and Soul Train’s year-end “Best of 2011” list. On the one year anniversary of his Fela Soul release, Amerigo found success a second time with the recently released Bizarre Tribe; A Quest To The Pharcyde. In merging Pharcyde vocals over re-orchestrated A Tribe called Quest samples into an album Okayplayer calls “funky like your great-grandpas draws with a fish in it”, the album was downloaded over 30,000 times in its first two weeks of release.","<p>With the breakthrough release of 2011’s <strong>Fela Soul</strong>, Amerigo Gazaway’s sophomore effort was declared “a virtual web hit” (<span class=""caps"">MTV</span>) seemingly overnight.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-soul-rebels","The Soul Rebels","","","The Soul Rebels formed when Lumar LeBlanc and Derrick Moss, originally members of New Orleans’ iconic Dejean’s Young Olympia Brass Band, decided they wanted to play the new, exciting music they were hearing on the radio while respecting the tradition they loved. Both New Orleans natives, the pair was steeped in the fundamentals of New Orleans jazz, but inevitably, contemporary styles of music began to seep into their psyches. While LeBlanc attended the famed St. Augustine High School, Moss went to Lil’ Wayne’s alma mater McMain High School, and paraded alongside soon-to-be Cash Money Records CEO Ronald “Slim” Williams in the school’s marching band. New sounds were all around and they found them as exciting as the horn-combo style featured in jazz funerals since the turn of the Twentieth Century.“We wanted to make our own sound without disrespecting the brass tradition,” LeBlanc recalls, “so we knew we had to break away.” They found a stylistic middle ground when they spun off and formed a band of young, like-minded local players from all over New Orleans. Graduates of university music programs throughout the South, the band took the marching band format they had learned in school and incorporated influences from outside the city as well as late-breaking local styles – R&B, funk and hip-hop – especially through half-sung, half-rapped lyrics. “Most of our originals have vocals,” says LeBlanc. “You wouldn’t have done that in a traditional brass band.”Soon, the Soul Rebels’ contagious originals and updated takes on standards won them a loyal local audience. They began rocking some of New Orleans’ most beloved live music venues. A chance gig opening for the Neville Brothers got them a real start—and an official name. It was youngest brother Cyril Neville who first called them “Soul Rebels,” a good name for a band that strived to incite positive change in its treasured musical heritage.Since those days, the band has settled on an eight-piece lineup, building a career around an eclectic live show that harnesses the power of horns and drums in the party-like atmosphere of a dance club. Their weekly show at Uptown New Orleans spot Le Bon Temps Roulé has been known to descend into a sweaty shout-along as the band mixes up songs from its five studio albums with hits by Jay-Z and OutKast. While touring the U.S., the Soul Rebels have shared the stage with notable artists from many corners of the pop and jazz worlds, including Arcade Fire, The Roots, Bootsy Collins, Robert Plant & Jimmy Page, Counting Crows, Green Day, Drive By Truckers, James Brown, Roy Hargrove, Allen Toussaint, Chuck Brown, Terence Blanchard, The Gap Band, Better than Ezra and many more. Averaging around 250 shows per year, the Soul Rebels have brought the party to stages as far away as South Africa and Europe, playing some of the world’s best-known music events, including, Umbria Jazz Fest, Antibes Jazz Festival, The Montreal Jazz festival, Bonnaroo, the Wanee Festival and, of course, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.When Hurricane Katrina struck their hometown in 2005, the band scattered across the region. Though a few members relocated to cities in Texas, the band frequently reconvened for gigs in New Orleans, this time with a renewed purpose. “Music has been the number one vehicle for Katrina recovery,” says LeBlanc. “That catastrophe has brought so much world wide attention to our music.” Indeed, since the storm, the band has been more successful than ever serving as an international ambassador of the New Orleans sound. Now a hardcore touring band with a solid-as-ever lineup, the band has recently represented its hometown on television, appearing in the season finale of the HBO series Treme, the Discovery Channel hit After the Catch, and the NBC broadcast of the parade before the Saints’ winning 2010 Super Bowl. In January of 2012, the band released its first international album, Unlock Your Mind, on Rounder Records. This new song-driven studio effort includes guest appearances by Cyril Neville, Trombone Shorty and Meters guitarist Leo Nocentelli. The album was produced by Rounder VP of A&R Scott Billington, who was also at the helm of many of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band’s groundbreaking albums.The Soul Rebels continue charting new territory today. Called “the missing link between Public Enemy and Louis Armstrong” by the Village Voice, the Soul Rebels combine top notch musicianship and songs with grooves that celebrate life in time-honored New Orleans style.","<p><b>The Soul Rebels formed when Lumar LeBlanc and Derrick Moss, originally members of New Orleans’ iconic Dejean’s Young Olympia Brass Band, decided they wanted to play the new, exciting music they were hearing on the radio while respecting the tradition they loved.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-dear-hunter","The Dear Hunter","Providence, RI","rock, indie, experimental, progressive rock","The Dear Hunter is the full-time project of Casey Crescenzo, formerly of post-hardcore band The Receiving End of Sirens. The band got its name from the lead character of the story that he wrote to go along with the music. The sound is unlike that of Casey’s former band, with more alternative and progressive rock tendencies and a wider variety of instrumentation. The band began as a side project of Casey Crescenzo when he was full time member of the Boston, Massachusetts band The Receiving End of Sirens. It was originally intended as a vehicle for music Casey had written that didn’t fit with the heavier sound of The Receiving End of Sirens. In the winter of 2005 Casey recorded the Dear Ms. Leading demos. He created 10 copies of the demos on burned CDs intended for the ears of friends, and they began circulation. At the time he did not plan to pursue The Dear Hunter full time and allowed the demos to be placed online for download. On February 2, 2006, The Dear Hunter played its first show with The Receiving End of Sirens as the backing band. In May 2006, Casey left The Receiving End of Sirens and began work on The Dear Hunter’s first studio album. He expanded the scope of the project to a six-album story set at the dawn of the 20th century about the birth, life, and abrupt death of a boy, known only in the story as ""The Dear Hunter."" In a 2007 interview with music website Absolutepunk.net, Casey stated that he already has the overall story of The Dear Hunter mapped out, with each act in 1-3 page treatments. Casey produced and recorded the EP by himself with only of the help of his brother on drums and mother on backing vocals. Act I: The Lake South, The River North was released in September 2006 on Triple Crown Records. Shortly after the EP’s release, Casey recruited Luke Dent of the recently split band Faraway for vocals and keyboards and Erick Serna as a second guitarist. Luke brought in his brother Sam Dent on drums and Erick brought long-time friend Josh Rheault in to play bass. The complete band entered the studio in late 2006 to record the follow-up to Act I. Recording finished in early 2007. Act II: The Meaning of, and All Things Regarding Ms. Leading was released May 22, 2007, only eight months after the band’s previous release. The band recently finished filming a music video for the song The Church And The Dime. They have also announced that they are currently working on nine albums, each of which is inspired by a different color of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet), with black and white added as bookends. They will include many guest appearances, and will span many different genres of music. Casey has said that the band’s main focus will still be the Act albums and music, but that each of the color albums will be from 30 to 60 minutes in length. A book based on the story of Act II is currently in the works. Artist Kent St. John was selected to do the illustrations, the progress of which can be seen on his blog. Prior to a string of dates with Circa Survive, Josh Rheault and brothers Sam and Luke Dent all left the band. Temporary replacements for the November tour dates included Cliff Sarcona and Julio Tavarez of As Tall as Lions and Andy Wildrick of The Junior Varsity. Wildrick would later join the band as a permanent member, along with Sagan Jacobson of Crown Atlantic on bass and Casey’s brother Nick Crescenzo on drums. The band embarked on their first headlining tour in mid-2008 with Lydia, Eye Alaska, and You, Me, and Everyone We Know. After the tour, the band plans to enter the studio to record Act III, which they hope to release in early 2009.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/funeral-suits","Funeral Suits","Dublin","indie, punk, alternative, post-punk","FUNERAL SUITS: LILY OF THE VALLEY Funeral Suits come from Dublin, Ireland and make rock music. Sometimes they make it dark, brooding, intense and monolithic. Sometimes they make it life affirming, surging and adrenalin charged. It’s beauty and beast combined in schizophrenic glory and it’s this duality which sets Funeral Suits apart. Their debut album ‘Lily Of The Valley’ has been produced by Stephen Street, best known for his work with Blur and The Smiths. Just released by leading Irish independent label Model Citizen, the album is a spellbinding showcase of shadows and light. Following a brace of well received limited edition EP’s, the final band line up of Brian James, Mik McKeogh, Greg McCarthy and Dar Grant released their debut single ‘Colour Fade’ on London based Friends Vs. Records in 2011. Along with the follow up ‘Health’, the song enjoyed support from Zane Lowe, Steve Lamacq and Huw Stephens. Following support slots with Franz Ferdinand, Passion Pit, The Macabees and Local Natives, the band played SXSW, The Great Escape and Leeds / Reading in 2011, before signing with Model Citizen. With three successful UK tours this year, ‘Lily Of The Valley’ has been warmly greeted by fans and critics alike. Recent single ‘All Those Friendly People’ with its stunning video, has enjoyed over one million views on YouTube. Current single ‘Hands Down’ has a thrilling sequel clip and can be picked up on very scarce Spanish 7” vinyl import. Radio support for the band continues to flourish at BBC Radio 1, XFM, BBC 6 Music, Q Radio, Absolute Radio and Amazing Radio. Meanwhile over in America, ‘Colour Fade’ is currently one of the most added tracks on the vast and influential US college radio network. Currently lining up dates their first European tour for early 2013, Funeral Suits really are a band cut from a different cloth. Praise for ‘Lily Of The Valley’… “A vibrant, creative debut” **** – Lauren Murphy, The Irish Times “The world should sit up and take notice now” **** – James Hendicott, Sunday Business Post (IE) “Hugely impressive” – Hot Press (IE) “A pioneering sound that’s bound to influence and inspire” – Rahilla Zafar, Huffington Post “A band with talent well beyond their years” 9/10 – Gareth O’Malley, Shout4Music (UK) “It sounds, as you would imagine, magnificent…. There’s enough here to suggest that their career might yet be an interesting one. Or a successful one. Or even, god forbid, both”. – Dara Higgins, Thumped.com (IE) “A huge sounding album with plenty of heart, as well as the psychology, ingenuity, power and maturity to make it a future classic”. 4.5 out of 5. Francois Botha, Rhythm Circus (UK) “Their debut album offers something of a refreshing, ambitious and frighteningly expansive platform from which they will no doubt springboard in 2012” – **** Jonathan Whitelaw, Is This Music? (UK) “The album is truly impressive and impossible to leave without at least one more swim within its warm beauty and darkened depths” – Ringmaster Review Blog “a considerably accomplished debut record” – 7/10 Saam Das, Faded Glamour (UK) “As far as polished sounding debuts go, you won’t find many better out there so far in 2012”. – 7/10 Lewis Parker, Exposed (UK) “A surefooted debut” – 7/10 Will Salmon, Clash Music (UK) “This debut is a delight, and Funeral Suits clearly have potential in the bucket-loads.” – 7/10 El Hunt, This Is Fake DIY (UK) “Outrageously good. Highly recommended” **** – Will Howard, AAA Music (UK) “Close to being a classic” – Johnny Rimmer, Stereoboard (UK) ‘Lily Of The Valley’ is a rousing debut’ * – Mike Doherty, The Fly (UK) “Stephen Street’s production gives the band the oomph required to pull off the epic sound they’re striving for.

In a city that’s direly needed an infusion of new, vital blood for a long time there are a growing number of bands that have emerged to offer original voices and bracing music. Super Water Sympathy are emblematic of the new breed, and their focus and direction belie their very short time together. In late August 2010 the band coalesced around brothers Billy and Clyde Hargrove (bass and guitar, respectively) and includes Ryan Robinson (drums), Jason Mills (keyboards) and Ansley Hughes (vocals). They realized that not only were their energies and sensibilities compatible, but that they simply sounded good playing together. Super Water Sympathy was born. Sweet synthesis They deliver taut, melodic music that’s both evocative and powerful. Billy and Ryan hold down the bottom end, and they’re met by the forceful mesh of guitar and keys that offers a fully formed, lyrics-ready framework. There’s an instinctive sense of structure at work, and the group’s current set bears this out. “We’re like what should have happened after the ‘90s,” offers Robinson. This tension and precision are evident on “Slade Was Made” and the fierce “Village,” wherein Hughes’ ferocity sets up a blistering guitar solo for a barnstorming net result that rocks like hell. The band shot a video for the addictive “You Us Hey” that’s definitely spread the message. Clyde and Jason set up the anthemic “Cherokee,” a track that perfectly joins lyric and arrangement, and there are surprises to be had such as the tempo-shifting, genre-splintering “Lucy Blue Who,” a jazzy little treat that coils and uncoils in sui generis delight Hughes, a heady admixture of Exene Cervenka and Siouxsie Sioux, layers the complexity of “Abzu” (a track of the caliber that most bands don’t deliver until way down the line), and the haunting, beseeching “Siren City” in which she pleads “…swallow me up by the salty sea…show me off to your family…” Stunner “Where Creswell Ends” builds to a dreamy swell that culminates in a crashing, brilliant cascade of sound, and again spawns a rich and bawling guitar solo. It’s powerful, engaging stuff indeed. In the current-day realms of popular music there are tradeoffs aplenty, with aspiring acts mining exhausted rock ‘n’ roll tropes and hollow, faux-confrontational poses. SWS hews to their own impulses, and when you’ve got their particular amalgam you don’t need to shop around to flesh out your approach. CD Vesper Belle enroute The band knew they needed a facility that could do their stuff justice, and decided on Sandbox Studio in Shreveport. They cut a few demos with Darren Osborn, and got dad Joe Osborn on board for the full-length, due in June. The duo’s expertise will show. “We’ve been in the studio for a while now,” says Clyde, and Billy notes of the record’s production “We don’t want to rush it.” It is available for pre-order on the band’s website, www.superwatersympathy.com. (Booking inquiries are directed to pyramidstarter@gmail.com). February was busy, as the band struck out for a series of regional dates, every one of which broadened their listener base and gained critical exposure. These shows (including a radio spot in College Station, Texas) were “…a really big deal for us,” says Ansley. “That was cool – that they thought we were good enough.” Soon there will be the album to tour behind, and other ideas to develop. “It’s the past mixing with the present…it’s the mainstream and counterculture meeting in the middle.” Clyde, while pragmatic, is also, like his bandmates, excited about the coming months – holding the physical record, promoting it, and the promise of further shows and new faces. “We’re really focused on getting out there…expanding out into the region,” he says. “We’ve had a good response with booking…we want to keep writing…to take over,” he finishes with a chuckle. And why not? Dave Bottoms Zeal Media Ltd. Shreveport ♫ New Orleans zealmedia1@gmail.com © 2011 FICTIONAL BIO: Super Water Sympathy’s origin began in the summer of 1393, during the final stages of the Yuson Dynasty. As this particular dynasty crumbled, the surging San’qaur Party moved their capital to Hanyang and proclaimed themselves rulers of the Korean peninsula. During the resulting reformation, Ansley Hughes (vocals) scraped by selling silk brocades to local merchants and traders. One day, the Minister of Rites, Yejo, asked Ansley, “If you sing me a song, I will purchase twenty brocades. Surely, that will be enough to support a Nobi (slave) for the duration of this lunar progression.” “Minister, you will hear me sing if, and only if, I’m given the twenty brocades before I begin."" “Ha! What is this, a Nobi giving me rules to follow? I think not!” “And what is this,” Ansley replied, “a pig of a man exploiting his power for paltry amusement?” Yejo, enraged by Ansley’s insult, sought immediate punishment and arrested her on the spot. She was sentenced and taken to the military fortification of Andyone, in which the notorious Byeongjo, Korean’s Minister of Defense, presided. Arriving at the console, she was processed and confined to a darkened cell containing four young men: Ryan Robinson (drums), Billy Hargrove (bass), Clyde Hargrove (guitar), and Jason Mills (piano). It wasn’t long before they began to discuss escape plans. To most, the notion of escaping from Byeongjo’s Andyone was impossible. Still, the five pressed on. The structure was completely fortified; there was no way to breach the structure physically. They would need help from someone on the inside – preferably, a guard. They had nothing to offer, in terms of money, but they still had their individual talents. Their strength lied in music. Perhaps if they could combine forces and create a unit, a band, they could provide the nearest guard with an array of melodies to catch his attention. They began to construct and play original music each and every night before going to sleep – loud enough to permeate from their tiny, darkened cell. They kept this up for a month, hoping someone had taken attention, before deciding to stop, abruptly. Days went by, and not a word was said. They began to panic. Perhaps their music wasn’t noticed, at all. And then, one night, they were awakened by a quiet knock on their cell. It was a guard. “Why did you stop the music?” he asked. They replied that they wouldn’t perform confined in a cell; the only way they would ever play again would be if they were on the outside, walking free. Frustrated, the guard retreated, only to return – with two additional guards – the next night. “Please play again – we’ll slip you extra rations. We need the music,” they pleaded. This went on, night after night, with more and more guards approaching their cell – finally, they reached an agreement. If the guards were to let them escape, they would form a band and travel the world performing their music – giving the guards infinite access to the melodies they’d fallen in love with. The guards agreed – reluctantly. They escaped just shy of dawn and made their way towards China. They decided to call their group Super Water Sympathy and played their first show in Beijing. From there, they continued to tour the Silk Road, garnering acclaim and popularity along the way. Today, Super Water Sympathy is recording their debut album, Vesper Belle.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/whitehorse","Whitehorse","Hamilton, Canada","metal, sludge, drone, doom metal","The classic tale of musical romance continues for Luke Doucet and Melissa McClelland, the husband and wife duo behind Whitehorse.The Fate of the World Depends on This Kiss is everything the talented pair’s first full length promised. As a whole, the album reveals the expanding range of creative possibility as Whitehorse develops and focuses their sound. Song by song, the record takes surprising turns; while each track bears Whitehorse’s signature blistering guitar work and love-knotted vocals, their willingness to take risks while staying true to themselves makes for captivating listening. From the opening track, the psychedelic-meets-Spaghetti Western scorch of “Achilles’ Desire” to the sunset-on-water acoustic sparkler “Mismatched Eyes (Boat Song),” the Archies-esque “Out Like A Lion,” (sweetened with a dash of “Sugar, Sugar”), and the pulp influenced suspense of ""Devil’s Got A Gun,” the album covers impressive ground without compromising its artistic coherence.Whitehorse’s live show is built on mesmerizing guitar work and smoldering vocal chemistry, but also brings much more to the stage with complex layers of percussion, keyboard and telephone receiver amplification, tangled like an embrace with the help of looping pedals.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/suuns","Suuns","Montreal, Canada","electronica, electronic, experimental, psychedelic","Montreal’s Suuns possess a rare trait in rock music: restraint. They use it like an instrument, which makes their debut full-length Zeroes QC as unsettling as it is wonderfully exasperating. It’s immediately apparent in album opener “Armed for Peace,” a track that starts off like a robot breaking down in a hot desert; the song’s mechanic beat plods like iron-shoed footsteps as the melody of a wheezing synth mirrors the crackling sound of old transistors and circuitry being cooked in the sun. It’s deceptively lulling, the tension almost unnoticeably wrenching up and up until the track unexpectedly opens into a barrage of nose-diving guitar riffs and crashing drums – yet the band still stays locked on the song’s linear, forward-motion direction. Suuns were born during the summer of 2006 when vocalist/guitarist Ben Shemie and guitarist/bassist Joe Yarmush got together to make some beats which quickly evolved into a few songs. The duo were soon joined by drummer Liam O’Neill and bassist/keyboardist Max Henry to complete the line-up. “I don’t think we were really a ‘band’ for the first year,” Ben surmises. It wasn’t until a friend helped them procure a spot at Pop Montreal 2007 that he says the group played their first “real gig.” Last year, Suuns entered Breakglass Studios with Jace Lasek of the Besnard Lakes co-producing and engineering, and recorded their first album. The group wanted to create something that couldn’t be pigeonholed as simply indie rock. “Jace definitely had a huge impact for bringing to life the big sound of the band and being open and willing stretch out any idea we or he had,” Ben explains. The resulting Zeroes QC is a warm yet dark, propulsive collusion of pop, post-punk and experimental rock – one that allows the group to musically shapeshift without losing any of the sense of tension and unease that runs throughout the record. During tracks like “Gaze,” tightly wound guitars and bass ring and buzz atop Liam’s metronomic, powerhouse drumming, with Ben’s cool, detached vocals acting as a nervy counterweight as he delivers falsely assuring lines like, “Don’t you be yourself, you are someone else.” Often his close-miced sing/speak is as metronomic as it is melodic; in “Arena” Ben’s rhythmic “What-choo, what-choo”’s are reminiscent of Suicide’s Alan Vega as he leads the band’s death disco groove into a bloodbath of razor-sharp guitars, while his icy, hushed delivery in “Sweet Nothing” is almost as motorik as the song itself. Most impressive, though, is how Suuns effortlessly sculpt memorable pop songs from experimental building blocks, frequently using noise and space as actual hooks. All of this amounts to a great first album – one that is as timeless as it is thrillingly modern.","<p>Montreal’s Suuns possess a rare trait in rock music: restraint.

A fresh set of songs on their debut EP, television appearances, bigger shows with cool Austin bands, and media attention began to feel the rewards of hard work and dedication. Then…everything changed. The departure of the band’s primary singer and contributing songwriter at the peak, caused a pause in the Winter of 2011. After some serious consideration, the three original members Ben, Deven, and Max decided to regroup, refocus, and redefine the sound of Residual Kid. Just a few months out of the scene, the band returned to the stage with new material and a new sound, much to the approval of their old fans and gaining new fans rapidly.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/paramore","Paramore","Franklin, TN","","Sometimes things just fall in to place. The five members of Paramore, vocalist Hayley Williams (17), bassist Jeremy Davis (21), lead guitarist Josh Farro (18), drummer Zac Farro (15) and guitarist Hunter Lamb (20) all discovered music on their own, in different ways, but as soon as they got together something just clicked. The confident, upbeat music found on their debut album ALL WE KNOW IS FALLING exudes a rare natural chemistry that is easily addictive and makes them impossible to ignore.It is this chemistry that keeps Paramore together and sets them apart from their peers. The young band came together in Franklin, Tennessee after 13 year-old Hayley moved into town and met two brothers – Josh and Zac Farro. The three enlisted bassist Jeremy Davis and began performing almost immediately. Newly christened Paramore, they played at local gatherings and their school talent show before graduating to rock venues in and around Franklin. The combination of musical energy between brothers and Hayley’s bold charisma earned them instant attention, particularly from Florida indie Fueled by Ramen, who signed the band and put them to work recording their debut. Says Hayley, “Some of our favorite bands are on Fueled by Ramen. We knew that they would know exactly how to carry out the vision for our band and music.” Paramore went into the studio with producers James Wisner (Dashboard Confessional, Further Seems Forever, Underoath) and Mike Green (Yellowcard, The Black Maria) and blew them away with their sincerity and enthusiasm.With the record complete, the band hit the road hard, touring constantly with Simple Plan, Straylight Run, The Vans Warped Tour and more, impressing crowds and critics with their passionate positivism. SPIN.com called lead singer Hayley a “powerhouse”, Alternative Press declared their songs “explosive and melody rich” and named them a band to watch in 2006, and The New York Times said ALL WE KNOW IS FALLING is one of the best, underrated albums of the year. MTV was so impressed that they chose them for a “You Hear It First” feature.Paramore describe their music with three words: energetic, emotional and fun. Their live show is explosive and high energy and showcases the bands relentless drive to make sure the audience is having as good a time as they are. In addition to her open-hearted vocal style, Williams has worked hard to expose her life and emotions in her songs. “I always try to write from personal experience,” says Hayley “At first what I was writing was kind of metaphorical, but now I’ve been trying to be more straightforward. It’s all about things that have happened to me or to the people that I love.” Paramore are truly all friends, friends who love playing together and have fun doing it. They share a common goal – to connect with people, and their enthusiasm is catching.","<p>Sometimes things just fall in to place. The five members of Paramore, vocalist Hayley Williams (17), bassist Jeremy Davis (21), lead guitarist Josh Farro (18), drummer Zac Farro (15) and guitarist Hunter Lamb (20) all discovered music on their own, in different ways, but as soon as they got together something just clicked. The confident, upbeat music found on their debut album <span class=""caps"">ALL</span> WE <span class=""caps"">KNOW</span> IS <span class=""caps"">FALLING</span> exudes a rare natural chemistry that is easily addictive and makes them impossible to ignore.</p><p><br></p><p>It is this chemistry that keeps Paramore together and sets them apart from their peers. The young band came together in Franklin, Tennessee after 13 year-old Hayley moved into town and met two brothers – Josh and Zac Farro. The three enlisted bassist Jeremy Davis and began performing almost immediately. Newly christened Paramore, they played at local gatherings and their school talent show before graduating to rock venues in and around Franklin. </p><p><br></p><p>The combination of musical energy between brothers and Hayley’s bold charisma earned them instant attention, particularly from Florida indie Fueled by Ramen, who signed the band and put them to work recording their debut.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/rustie","RUSTIE","","","Glasgow’s talent pool clearly runs deep, and if the city’s last few years of genre-busting electronic music have made anything remotely clear it’s that Rustie is one of the deep-fried kingdom’s crown jewels. Emerging with the rest of the multi-talented Numbers crew, and with only a handful of laser-guided releases to his name, his presence far outreaches his focused, evolving discography. Rightly mentioned in the same breath with many of the most innovative producers in the world, astute Pitchfork scribe Martin Clarke once described Rustie’s music “like a metaphor for living in intense digital excess” – something everyone should be able to relate to. As is often the case, this digital excess also mirrors the excesses of the physical world, and so Rustie time travels for the cocaine-addled synthesizer washes and searing guitar tones of 1980’s pop, the cash-infused bombast of new-millennium R&B, the pit-of-your-stomach ecstasy high of the most classic rave memories and the bloodshot scowl of white-hot pirate radio broadcasts. In 2007, with a new generation of irreverent producers and artists seemingly simultaneously uploading their music to MySpace, Rustie’s Jagz The Smack EP was a miniature revelation. In a swift five tracks, it managed to not only synthesize the tone of mid-decade electronic music, but also provided a danceable prediction for much of what would soon be called “UK bass music” (not to mention many other, far less eloquent, names). It would take 3 more years to move through a string of now classic 12”s like “Zig-Zag”, “Bad Science” and “Play Doe/Tempered”, his collaboration with Bristol’s mighty Joker. This unfettered run was capped by a string of essential remixes (or “Resmacks” in the parlance of Rustie) for the likes of Jamie Lidell, Kelis, The Big Pink and Nicki Minaj, leading into his debut EP for Warp, Sunburst. In another breathless five-track flash, Sunburst amalgamated Rustie’s love for obscure Japanese prog-rock, 16-bit video game sonics and icy grime and Detroit techno heft into a fleeting vision of the future of rave music. Snare rolls ricocheted, synths undulated in hypercolor hues and the bass bubbled over, the stage was set. Now after taking shape in the studio over the course of the past two years, Glass Swords arrives, and as the otherworldly landscape of the album artwork suggests, it is epic and alien. Opening with the beguiling synth and guitar meditation that is the album’s title track, this is the last chance to take a deep breath before the rushing neon strains of bright melody and earthquake drums of “Flash Back” and Surph”. Next up “Hover Traps” references the twitchy slap-bass and punchy electronic chords of 80’s funk masters like Midnight Star and Lamont Dozier while “City Star” achieves the perfect balance of tunefulness and menace of the best grime productions. Through the middle of the record, a triptych of tracks present themselves as the model of the updated version of rave music Rustie has mastered. First single (and longtime club favorite) “Ultra Thizz” is all breakdowns and build-ups structured around whip-crack snare drums, while “Death Mountain” and “Cry Flames” deal in the kind of soaring hooks and basement low-end that might very well leave permanent marks on your home stereo. As the album draws into it’s closing few tracks, skittish hooks and warm textures sweep in and out of focus without ever losing the warped narrative that effectively joins Glass Swords into a startling cohesive whole. As an album, it’s one that doesn’t let up and demands repeat listens to fully appreciate the myriad hum-along melodies and wicked production u-turns, and don’t worry about the jittery over-caffeinated feeling you’ll have after listening…it’s to be expected.","<p>Glasgow’s talent pool clearly runs deep, and if the city’s last few years of genre-busting electronic music have made anything remotely clear it’s that Rustie is one of the deep-fried kingdom’s crown jewels.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/reigning-sound","Reigning Sound","Asheville NC","","Founded by Memphis blues-punk legend Greg Cartwright — a former member of the Oblivians, the Compulsive Gamblers, and ‘68 Comeback — Reigning Sound fuse the hot-wired energy of garage rock with the deep emotional resonance of classic soul music in a manner that suggests a cross between the early Rolling Stones and the Sonics. Featuring Cartwright on vocals and guitar, Jeremy Scott on bass, Greg Roberson on drums, and Alex Greene on keyboards and guitar, Reigning Sound made their recorded debut with a three-song 7"" in May of 2001; their first full-length album, Break Up Break Down, was released a month later on Sympathy for the Record Industry. In August of 2002, the group upped the rock quotient on its second album (and first for In the Red), Time Bomb High School, and the group landed a high-profile gig opening for Swedish garage wunderkinds the Hives on their North American tour. Alex Greene dropped out as a full-time group member by the time 2004’s Too Much Guitar was released, though he did appear on the disc as a guest musician, and the band followed its release with more touring, both as a headliner and once again as opener for the Hives. The band also gained another well-known champion in Little Steven Van Zandt, who gave the band frequent airplay on his syndicated radio show. In September 2005 Reigning Sound released Home for Orphans through Sympathy for the Record Industry. It featured reworked versions of Too Much Guitar material along with some unreleased tracks. Listen at Last.fm NEW REIGNING SOUND LIVE LP (Goner In-Store Performance!) NOW available from GONER RECORDS, www.goner-records.com ************************************************************** ASHEVILLE, N.C Another Friday night, another rock band. Well, not just any band this is Reigning Sound, recently transplanted from Memphis to Asheville and one of the most respected outfits in the land. How respected? No less than Steve Van Zandt, he of Springsteen, Sopranos and ""Little Stevens Underground Garage,"" informed yours truly a couple of years ago that Reigning Sound was one of his fave new bands. Hives vocalist Howlin' Pelle Almqvist is so smitten that he selected the groups last album, Time Bomb High School, as one of his top picks of 2002, more recently inviting Reigning Sound to be the opening act, along with Sahara Hotnights, on the Hives upcoming U.S. tour. And in the Motor City, toasts to Reigning Sound singer/guitarist Greg Cartwright are hoisted with regularity, Jack White dropping his name in interviews and several bands going as far as to cover his songs (notably the Detroit Cobras, who reworked Cartwrights ""Bad Man"" as ""Bad Girl"" on Mink, Rat or Rabbit). All the respect in the world, however, won't buy Cartwright disaster insurance, at least not tonight in Asheville. For starters, Reigning Sound Cartwright, bassist Jeremy Scott and drummer Lance Willie, making his public debut with the band is breaking in the new trapsman in preparation for a brief European trek to promote the trios just-released Too Much Guitar! and some of the song arrangements are still decidedly rough-edged. Too, the set is plagued with gremlins, most notoriously when Scott pops a bass string during a frenetic cover of the Rationals ""Feeling Lost"" to bring things to a halt. Everyone looks around sheepishly for a moment, then Cartwright, mindful of the dead air, starts strumming his guitar and eases into a tender version of Sam Cookes ""Darling I Need You Now."" Willie takes the cue, as does Scott once hes finished restringing his axe; the volume steadily rises, the clubs emotional pulse quickens, and soon enough the bands plowing full-tilt into its meaty brand of garage n soul. As the saying goes, these guys wanna take us higher. And they do. ""Jeremy never breaks a bass string good thing that was a warm-up,"" Cartwright confides a couple of weeks later. ""Luckily in Europe, by the second show, it was great. We were firing on all cylinders. When you find the groove and you can look at the bass player and the drummer and everybody knows what the others are thinking, well, once you get it to that point, its hard to go wrong."" I'm sitting in the living room of Cartwright's two-story brick house, located in the tidy middle-class Asheville neighborhood where he and his family moved just a few months ago. Dominating one corner of the room is a massive old jukebox and a couple of guitar cases; across from it is the stereo, which Cartwright frequently steps to during the interview, spinning everything from vintage Everly Brothers and Motown to Lords Of The New Church and Eric Carmen's pre-Raspberries outfit Cyrus Erie. Lining one wall are bookcases overflowing with music biographies, while looking down upon us from another wall is a framed copy of the Big Bopper's Chantilly Lace LP. The phone rings several times: a promoter wanting to book Reigning Sound for off nights during the Hives tour, the person taking care of merch for the tour, etc. Music stuff aside, Cartwright also appears to be pretty domesticated. Family pooch Merle wanders in and out of the room, as do sons Andrew, 12, and Alex. (Alex: ""Can I get some pillows and take them into my room?"" Greg: ""Are you building a fort?"" ""Yeah."" ""OK, thats alright."") Midway through the conversation his wife Esther comes downstairs bearing 8-month old Ruby, who's decided that taking part in a big-time rock n roll interview trumps such mundane matters as her afternoon nap. (You cant make this stuff up: When daddy puts on the Motown platter, Ruby bursts into a kind of sitting down, shimmy-frugging dance.) But despite the distractions, Cartwright, quick-witted and about as forthcoming as any interview subject Ive ever grilled, keeps the ball rolling. Cartwright, of course, as a member of the Compulsive Gamblers and the notorious Oblivians, has been a fixture on the national garage scene since the early 90s. Now 34, he was born and raised in Memphis, and growing up was able to tap his fathers extensive record collection, which ran the gamut from pop (Beatles, Stones, Byrds) and early rock-n-roll (Haley, Holly, Cash, Elvis) to more underground artists such as Zappa, Beefheart, Spirit and Alice Cooper. ""But,"" says Cartwright, ""the one thing that stuck with me probably the longest was his Harry Nilsson stuff. The albums, they were really strange, you know? Kind of punk, but pretty. I remember reaching my teenage years and listening to that song: [sings] ""Youre breaking my heart, youre tearing it apart, so fuck you!"" To a kid, youre just going, Yeahhh! Curse words!"" Cartwright would get his own shot at twisting the minds of adolescents when the Oblivians issued their 1995 album Soul Food (key track: ""And Then I Fucked Her""), but in the meantime, there were high school classes to endure and bands to form. The metal and hardcore outfits of the mid-80s didnt click with Cartwright, but one punk band did, The Misfits, whose obvious indebtedness to classic 50s and 60s pop, despite the hi-energy arrangements, appealed to Cartwrights already-formed sense of melody and song structure. ""The idea about punk, for me,"" says Cartwright, ""was that you took all these classic ideas about rock and country and blues and make them more aggressive and twist them into something different and more modern. Eventually, though, I just thought I'd forget the punk thing and just do that classic stuff."" Enter the Compulsive Gamblers, which Cartwright assembled with guitarist Jack Yarber in the early 90s. The alcohol-fueled (""hangover music,"" quips Cartwright), eclectic combo lasted about three years before mutating into the Oblivians, the 2-guitar/drums/no-bass outfit whose crude, oftentimes X-rated brand of punk/skronk/blooze demolition is still discussed in awestruck tones among lo-fi garage-rock fans. More than one reviewer, in fact, has commented how, to a degree, the Oblivians may have been the Meat Puppets to the White Stripes/Hives/Strokes Nirvana. I make this observation to Cartwright. He thinks about it for a second, then grins. ""We did an Oblivians reunion gig in Memphis last Halloween and the Hives flew all the way out to see us. Someone was talking to Pelle about just that, and he said to them, No, were the Stones and the Oblivians are Howlin' Wolf!"" Cartwright scoffs, however, at those other assertions, that the Oblivians were misogynist negative creeps, comparing his bands oeuvre to the Angry Samoans earlier brand of cartoonish provocation. He's also got a touching story to go with the viewpoint: ""There was a time we went to this record store in Tuscaloosa and I was looking at the R-section. Two kids, probably about 15 or so, come in and go straight to the Os. One kid pulls out our 10"" with DLana on the cover [1994 Oblivians EP featuring a nude nubile on the sleeve] and he goes to the other kid, Look man, I told you! Ahh, man, shes so hot! Ahhhhh That record probably brought them into the store ten times in the next month, just to look at it and to show somebody: Look at this! To see that happen was pretty incredible."" From 1993-98 the Oblivians pursued their Amerindie scorched-earth policy, issuing scores of records in the process before disbanding. (Cartwright: ""Better to stop when youre having fun and still making good records. No reason to taint a good legacy."") For a couple of years the Gamblers resumed operations, Cartwright additionally releasing a solo record and producing bands. Among those hes overseen are Detroit Cobras, the Porch Ghouls, Mr. Airplane Man, the Cuts and Deadly Snakes he even joined the lineup of the latter for a short while. Then he decided to wipe the slate completely clean with Reigning Sound. While still in the Oblivians, Cartwright had begun stockpiling tunes he deemed too ""moody or melancholy"" for the band, and after selecting a bunch of mellow, folkish tunes from other songwriters (Gene Clark, Brian Wilson, Everly Brothers) he was ready to unveil his new direction a sound that Cartwright knew from the outset was guaranteed not to click with his core fan base of Oblivians aficionados. An EP plus an album, Break Up Break Down, appeared on Sympathy in 2001, and Reigning Sound was officially a go. Admits Cartwright, ""The people that liked the Oblivians, with the first Reigning Sound album, they really hated it! But you should never give people what they want give em what they need. And they needed to go out and spend eight dollars and hate it, and then two months down the road realize they like it."" 'Break Up' was followed in 2002 with Time Bomb High School (In The Red), a stylistic shift towards poppier territory that practically read like a love letter to the late, great teen garage bands of the early 60s (it included covers of Memphians the Gentrys and the Guilloteens). The new Too Much Guitar! marks another sonic detour, for while the melodies are present with much of the album recorded under live conditions theres also a seething primal, overdriven quality that just might bring lapsed Oblivians fans back into the fold. Case in point: leadoff track ""We Repel Each Other,"" which takes a ""Daytripper""-like riff and a big-beat Fleshtones-like rhythm, then rams the tune through a broken speaker cone to come out sounding like the Stones circa Got Live If You Want It! The song also boasts a line destined to become one of the all-time great teen-angst lyrics: ""Id like to touch you/ But youre surrounded by static!"" Yet crafting the Reigning Sound records to sound like a different band each time isn't an indicator of a musically perverse personality. ""You know, someone listening to Let It Be and Meet The Beatles wouldn't think that was the same band, either. Some people like 'Time Bomb' because its got all these pop hooks in it but don't like the new one because its too abrasive. But if you listen, my songwriting style hasnt changed; the hooks are all still there, still just basically pop music, its just a little more aggressive and in your face. Part of what I always try to do is make each record individual to the one before. It keeps me on my toes keeps me interested. Also, its your job as an artist and musician to test the limits of what people think they will like."" Cartwright has already told me that, among his motivations for coming to Asheville, an artsy town tucked away in the Blue Ridge Mountains, are its reputation for being a wonderful place to raise kids and the presence of a low-key but positive-feeling music scene. And with his new drummer already a resident and his bassist currently pondering the move from Memphis as well, from a professional standpoint, he's not feeling that remote. Given, however, that over the years he's also become a de facto honorary citizen of Detroit, working with bands and cultivating scores of lasting friendships there, I ask him why didnt he head north to the Motor City where career opportunities no doubt beckoned? ""Well,"" he explains, ""I'm friends, of course, with Dan and Mick and Peggy, the Gories, I've known them for a long time. And the Detroit Cobras, I produced some of their records and theyve covered some of my songs. Scott Morgan; weve played with him in the past and even backed him once. There's Eddie Kirkland, who was second lead guitar on the early John Lee Hooker stuff, weve played with him. The Gamblers backed Andre Williams, while in the Gamblers for awhile was the original Cobras bass player, Jeff Meier. I feel like I've spent so much time in Detroit, everybody who's doing anything there I've met them and been friends with them. And we actually looked at Detroit a few years ago; one of my wifes best friends lives there, and shes married to one of my good friends. A bunch of people were lobbying for us to move there, and we priced real estate, looked around, but in the end, it was more like a great place to visit and vacation and I didnt want to lose that by living there full-time. ""The thing about my records is that they are good records that have by and large gone unnoticed by the mass populace, so I haven't had to deal with a lot of attention. That keeps things right where I like it: I sell enough records so that whoever puts my record out will let me do whatever I want, but not so much attention that a major label would sign me to a contract where I have to do what they want me to do. We've had a few people call, but its always some assistant to an A&R person and inevitably what they ask is, ""So and so brought your name up and we were wondering if you could send two CDs so we could think about whether it would be something for us,"" I just go, Look, I've known A&R people, and I know you have a budget. So if you want to hear it, run out and buy it. Sending two copies to an A&R guy? You might as well set the CDs on fire. ""So I'm right where I want to be and it makes me really comfortable."" As if on cue a sudden wail from Ruby interrupts us. Shes been diligently sucking down her afternoon bottle and now nature calls. As the father of a young child myself, I've got a hunch that she needs Cartwright more right now than I do, so I gather my things, nod at Big Bopper hellooo, baby! and leave the garage rock icon to his diaper duties……. by: Fred Mills for the Metro Times in Detroit Michigan…….","<p>Founded by Memphis blues-punk legend Greg Cartwright — a former member of the Oblivians, the Compulsive Gamblers, and ‘68 Comeback — Reigning Sound fuse the hot-wired energy of garage rock with the deep emotional resonance of classic soul music in a manner that suggests a cross between the early Rolling Stones and the Sonics.

It featured reworked versions of Too Much Guitar material along with some unreleased tracks. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Reigning+Sound"" target=""_blank"">Listen at Last.fm</a><br /><table border=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""435"" bgcolor=""#ffcc99"" bordercolor=""#ffcc99""><tbody><tr><td class=""text"" width=""300"" height=""17"" align=""left"" valign=""center"" bgcolor=""#ffcc99""><span class=""orangetext15""></span><br /></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <table border=""0"" cellspacing=""3"" cellpadding=""3"" width=""435"" align=""center"" bgcolor=""#ffffff"" bordercolor=""#000000""> <tbody><tr> <td width=""435"" align=""left"" valign=""top"" bgcolor=""#ffffff""> <span class=""caps"">NEW</span> <span class=""caps"">REIGNING</span> <span class=""caps"">SOUND</span> <span class=""caps"">LIVE</span> LP (Goner In-Store Performance!) <span class=""caps"">NOW</span> available from <span class=""caps"">GONER</span> <span class=""caps"">RECORDS</span>, www.goner-records.com ************************************************************** <span class=""caps"">ASHEVILLE</span>, N.C Another Friday night, another rock band. Well, not just any band this is Reigning Sound, recently transplanted from Memphis to Asheville and one of the most respected outfits in the land. How respected? No less than Steve Van Zandt, he of Springsteen, Sopranos and ""Little Stevens Underground Garage,"" informed yours truly a couple of years ago that Reigning Sound was one of his fave new bands. Hives vocalist Howlin' Pelle Almqvist is so smitten that he selected the groups last album, Time Bomb High School, as one of his top picks of 2002, more recently inviting Reigning Sound to be the opening act, along with Sahara Hotnights, on the Hives upcoming U.S. tour. And in the Motor City, toasts to Reigning Sound singer/guitarist Greg Cartwright are hoisted with regularity, Jack White dropping his name in interviews and several bands going as far as to cover his songs (notably the Detroit Cobras, who reworked Cartwrights ""Bad Man"" as ""Bad Girl"" on Mink, Rat or Rabbit). All the respect in the world, however, won't buy Cartwright disaster insurance, at least not tonight in Asheville. For starters, Reigning Sound Cartwright, bassist Jeremy Scott and drummer Lance Willie, making his public debut with the band is breaking in the new trapsman in preparation for a brief European trek to promote the trios just-released Too Much Guitar! and some of the song arrangements are still decidedly rough-edged. Too, the set is plagued with gremlins, most notoriously when Scott pops a bass string during a frenetic cover of the Rationals ""Feeling Lost"" to bring things to a halt. Everyone looks around sheepishly for a moment, then Cartwright, mindful of the dead air, starts strumming his guitar and eases into a tender version of Sam Cookes ""Darling I Need You Now."" Willie takes the cue, as does Scott once hes finished restringing his axe; the volume steadily rises, the clubs emotional pulse quickens, and soon enough the bands plowing full-tilt into its meaty brand of garage n soul. As the saying goes, these guys wanna take us higher. And they do. ""Jeremy never breaks a bass string good thing that was a warm-up,"" Cartwright confides a couple of weeks later. ""Luckily in Europe, by the second show, it was great. We were firing on all cylinders. When you find the groove and you can look at the bass player and the drummer and everybody knows what the others are thinking, well, once you get it to that point, its hard to go wrong."" I'm sitting in the living room of Cartwright's two-story brick house, located in the tidy middle-class Asheville neighborhood where he and his family moved just a few months ago. Dominating one corner of the room is a massive old jukebox and a couple of guitar cases; across from it is the stereo, which Cartwright frequently steps to during the interview, spinning everything from vintage Everly Brothers and Motown to Lords Of The New Church and Eric Carmen's pre-Raspberries outfit Cyrus Erie. Lining one wall are bookcases overflowing with music biographies, while looking down upon us from another wall is a framed copy of the Big Bopper's Chantilly Lace LP. The phone rings several times: a promoter wanting to book Reigning Sound for off nights during the Hives tour, the person taking care of merch for the tour, etc. Music stuff aside, Cartwright also appears to be pretty domesticated. Family pooch Merle wanders in and out of the room, as do sons Andrew, 12, and Alex. (Alex: ""Can I get some pillows and take them into my room?"" Greg: ""Are you building a fort?"" ""Yeah."" ""OK, thats alright."") Midway through the conversation his wife Esther comes downstairs bearing 8-month old Ruby, who's decided that taking part in a big-time rock n roll interview trumps such mundane matters as her afternoon nap. (You cant make this stuff up: When daddy puts on the Motown platter, Ruby bursts into a kind of sitting down, shimmy-frugging dance.) But despite the distractions, Cartwright, quick-witted and about as forthcoming as any interview subject Ive ever grilled, keeps the ball rolling. Cartwright, of course, as a member of the Compulsive Gamblers and the notorious Oblivians, has been a fixture on the national garage scene since the early 90s. Now 34, he was born and raised in Memphis, and growing up was able to tap his fathers extensive record collection, which ran the gamut from pop (Beatles, Stones, Byrds) and early rock-n-roll (Haley, Holly, Cash, Elvis) to more underground artists such as Zappa, Beefheart, Spirit and Alice Cooper. ""But,"" says Cartwright, ""the one thing that stuck with me probably the longest was his Harry Nilsson stuff. The albums, they were really strange, you know? Kind of punk, but pretty. I remember reaching my teenage years and listening to that song: [sings] ""Youre breaking my heart, youre tearing it apart, so fuck you!"" To a kid, youre just going, Yeahhh! Curse words!"" Cartwright would get his own shot at twisting the minds of adolescents when the Oblivians issued their 1995 album Soul Food (key track: ""And Then I Fucked Her""), but in the meantime, there were high school classes to endure and bands to form. The metal and hardcore outfits of the mid-80s didnt click with Cartwright, but one punk band did, The Misfits, whose obvious indebtedness to classic 50s and 60s pop, despite the hi-energy arrangements, appealed to Cartwrights already-formed sense of melody and song structure. ""The idea about punk, for me,"" says Cartwright, ""was that you took all these classic ideas about rock and country and blues and make them more aggressive and twist them into something different and more modern. Eventually, though, I just thought I'd forget the punk thing and just do that classic stuff."" Enter the Compulsive Gamblers, which Cartwright assembled with guitarist Jack Yarber in the early 90s. The alcohol-fueled (""hangover music,"" quips Cartwright), eclectic combo lasted about three years before mutating into the Oblivians, the 2-guitar/drums/no-bass outfit whose crude, oftentimes X-rated brand of punk/skronk/blooze demolition is still discussed in awestruck tones among lo-fi garage-rock fans. More than one reviewer, in fact, has commented how, to a degree, the Oblivians may have been the Meat Puppets to the White Stripes/Hives/Strokes Nirvana. I make this observation to Cartwright. He thinks about it for a second, then grins. ""We did an Oblivians reunion gig in Memphis last Halloween and the Hives flew all the way out to see us. Someone was talking to Pelle about just that, and he said to them, No, were the Stones and the Oblivians are Howlin' Wolf!"" Cartwright scoffs, however, at those other assertions, that the Oblivians were misogynist negative creeps, comparing his bands oeuvre to the Angry Samoans earlier brand of cartoonish provocation. He's also got a touching story to go with the viewpoint: ""There was a time we went to this record store in Tuscaloosa and I was looking at the R-section. Two kids, probably about 15 or so, come in and go straight to the Os. One kid pulls out our 10"" with DLana on the cover [1994 Oblivians EP featuring a nude nubile on the sleeve] and he goes to the other kid, Look man, I told you! Ahh, man, shes so hot! Ahhhhh That record probably brought them into the store ten times in the next month, just to look at it and to show somebody: Look at this! To see that happen was pretty incredible."" From 1993-98 the Oblivians pursued their Amerindie scorched-earth policy, issuing scores of records in the process before disbanding. (Cartwright: ""Better to stop when youre having fun and still making good records. No reason to taint a good legacy."") For a couple of years the Gamblers resumed operations, Cartwright additionally releasing a solo record and producing bands. Among those hes overseen are Detroit Cobras, the Porch Ghouls, Mr. Airplane Man, the Cuts and Deadly Snakes he even joined the lineup of the latter for a short while. Then he decided to wipe the slate completely clean with Reigning Sound. While still in the Oblivians, Cartwright had begun stockpiling tunes he deemed too ""moody or melancholy"" for the band, and after selecting a bunch of mellow, folkish tunes from other songwriters (Gene Clark, Brian Wilson, Everly Brothers) he was ready to unveil his new direction a sound that Cartwright knew from the outset was guaranteed not to click with his core fan base of Oblivians aficionados. An EP plus an album, Break Up Break Down, appeared on Sympathy in 2001, and Reigning Sound was officially a go. Admits Cartwright, ""The people that liked the Oblivians, with the first Reigning Sound album, they really hated it! But you should never give people what they want give em what they need. And they needed to go out and spend eight dollars and hate it, and then two months down the road realize they like it."" 'Break Up' was followed in 2002 with Time Bomb High School (In The Red), a stylistic shift towards poppier territory that practically read like a love letter to the late, great teen garage bands of the early 60s (it included covers of Memphians the Gentrys and the Guilloteens). The new Too Much Guitar! marks another sonic detour, for while the melodies are present with much of the album recorded under live conditions theres also a seething primal, overdriven quality that just might bring lapsed Oblivians fans back into the fold. Case in point: leadoff track ""We Repel Each Other,"" which takes a ""Daytripper""-like riff and a big-beat Fleshtones-like rhythm, then rams the tune through a broken speaker cone to come out sounding like the Stones circa Got Live If You Want It! The song also boasts a line destined to become one of the all-time great teen-angst lyrics: ""Id like to touch you/ But youre surrounded by static!"" Yet crafting the Reigning Sound records to sound like a different band each time isn't an indicator of a musically perverse personality. ""You know, someone listening to Let It Be and Meet The Beatles wouldn't think that was the same band, either. Some people like 'Time Bomb' because its got all these pop hooks in it but don't like the new one because its too abrasive. But if you listen, my songwriting style hasnt changed; the hooks are all still there, still just basically pop music, its just a little more aggressive and in your face. Part of what I always try to do is make each record individual to the one before. It keeps me on my toes keeps me interested. Also, its your job as an artist and musician to test the limits of what people think they will like."" Cartwright has already told me that, among his motivations for coming to Asheville, an artsy town tucked away in the Blue Ridge Mountains, are its reputation for being a wonderful place to raise kids and the presence of a low-key but positive-feeling music scene. And with his new drummer already a resident and his bassist currently pondering the move from Memphis as well, from a professional standpoint, he's not feeling that remote. Given, however, that over the years he's also become a de facto honorary citizen of Detroit, working with bands and cultivating scores of lasting friendships there, I ask him why didnt he head north to the Motor City where career opportunities no doubt beckoned? ""Well,"" he explains, ""I'm friends, of course, with Dan and Mick and Peggy, the Gories, I've known them for a long time. And the Detroit Cobras, I produced some of their records and theyve covered some of my songs. Scott Morgan; weve played with him in the past and even backed him once. There's Eddie Kirkland, who was second lead guitar on the early John Lee Hooker stuff, weve played with him. The Gamblers backed Andre Williams, while in the Gamblers for awhile was the original Cobras bass player, Jeff Meier. I feel like I've spent so much time in Detroit, everybody who's doing anything there I've met them and been friends with them. And we actually looked at Detroit a few years ago; one of my wifes best friends lives there, and shes married to one of my good friends. A bunch of people were lobbying for us to move there, and we priced real estate, looked around, but in the end, it was more like a great place to visit and vacation and I didnt want to lose that by living there full-time. ""The thing about my records is that they are good records that have by and large gone unnoticed by the mass populace, so I haven't had to deal with a lot of attention. That keeps things right where I like it: I sell enough records so that whoever puts my record out will let me do whatever I want, but not so much attention that a major label would sign me to a contract where I have to do what they want me to do. We've had a few people call, but its always some assistant to an A&R person and inevitably what they ask is, ""So and so brought your name up and we were wondering if you could send two CDs so we could think about whether it would be something for us,"" I just go, Look, I've known A&R people, and I know you have a budget. So if you want to hear it, run out and buy it. Sending two copies to an A&R guy? You might as well set the CDs on fire. ""So I'm right where I want to be and it makes me really comfortable."" As if on cue a sudden wail from Ruby interrupts us. Shes been diligently sucking down her afternoon bottle and now nature calls. As the father of a young child myself, I've got a hunch that she needs Cartwright more right now than I do, so I gather my things, nod at Big Bopper hellooo, baby! and leave the garage rock icon to his diaper duties……. by: Fred Mills for the Metro Times in Detroit Michigan……. <br /></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/78901/1_poster.jpg","http://www.youtube.com/e/rFa462PofmA?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

Staggering between beautiful, bursting synth-filled pop melodies and the complicated, often harsh consequences of reality in her lyrics, she unites these elements together in an explosion of vibrant emotion and hypnotizing intensity. Taking shape in early 2011, Mozart’s Sister thrives on complex layering, melding upbeat, sparkling dance loops with tremendous, belting vocals, only to morph into pulsating sci-fi drones and dark rhythms atop sensuous, assertive vocals. This sense of unexpected fluidity and change flows throughout Dear Fear, her self-recorded and self-released debut EP of 2011, dancing between the rhapsody and destructive components of sex, love and relationships. Labeled “bedroom paranoia,” Dear Fear explores the wild, untamed energy manifested within the confines of one’s own space and the inner power developed to break down these walls. In “Don’t Leave It To Me,” Thompson-Hannant belts, “I wrote this song after I met you,” a statement that Pitchfork praises, “if it resulted in a pop gem like this – you’re left feeling grateful for that chance encounter.” Influenced by mainstream R & B and Prince, ‘90s trip-hop and Björk, and the current shift in electronic music, Thompson-Hannant incorporates this sense of collage into her work, constantly transforming her voice and sound against a gorgeous, direct aesthetic with an uncontainable passion and sense of expression. Mixed in with the sassy, riveting confidence of defining groups like TLC and Salt-N-Pepa, Mozart’s Sister is also both influenced by and a part of the groundbreaking modern Montreal electronic music scene, characterized with the same vigor and charisma as such female contemporaries she’s shared the stage with, Grimes and tUnE-yArDs.

The band will clock up close to 10,000 miles in their trusty Land Rover as they criss-cross the country to entertain their growing legion of fans with their rollicking brand of English Folk.</p> <p>Whether its heave-ho-ing shanties, family penned traditional songs or their own trade mark sounds from a lost summer spent tripping through fields of corn or hazy nights at a country pub, Skinny Lister is a lifestyle and the soundtrack to happiness.<br /> Skinny Lister will release their as yet untitled debut album early next year. Recorded in deepest darkest Snowdonia with producer David Wrench (Bat for Lashes, James Yorkston), the album captures the infectious energy, raucous rum totting fun and sing along sun-smacked smiling feeling that a Skinny Lister gig always provides. <br /> Skinny Lister’s infectious melodies have already pricked the most discernible of ears including, 6 Music’s Steve Lamacq and Tom Robinson who have championed the band for the past two years.</p> <p>So come along for the ride, we are Skinny Lister…Haul away, Haul away!!</p> <p>The players -</p> <p>Daniel Heptinstall – Guitar<br /> Lorna Thomas – Ukelele<br /> Max Thomas – Melodeon<br /> Sam Brace – Electric Guitar<br /> Dan Gray – Double Bass</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7490565/0c89ed13d64bfb892f05d597493275b2_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/UsqaLfWMcp8?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

They have performed on the BBC, NPR, and RTE. They have shared the stage with acts like Old Crow Medicine Show, Mumford and Sons, Wilco, The Red Stick Ramblers, Pokey LaFarge and the South City Three, and Woody Pines. Their all original sound is infectious and has spread far and wide to audiences of all ages and walks of life. Based in Portland, Oregon these young gents got their start busking on street corners playing traditional old time and bluegrass, eventually honing their sound as a solid dance band playing square dances and bluegrass festivals up and down the west coast. However, the boys wanted to take the music further and thus, their new original sound was born. Loosely based in the traditions of old time, bluegrass, punk rock, blues, Cajun, and country their sonic creations transcend all musical boundaries. Their authentic songs feature tight 3 part harmonies and powerful instrumentals. This combined with the lightning energy of their stage performances has made them a favorite amongst folk music connoisseurs throughout the US and Europe alike. Their latest record, “Sole Kitchen” (Self-Released 2010) features 13 original works with song contributions from each member of the band. The album was recorded by punk rocker Mike Herrera of MXPX and Tumbledown at his Monkey Trench Studios in Bremmerton, WA. -———————————————————- Past band members *Walter Spencer *Peter Daggett *Kristen Harris *Ben Wheeler *Arianne Shimanoff *Daniel Van Dyk *Andrew MacAusland","<p>After 5 years on the road, 4 albums under their belt and multiple international tours, the Water Tower Bucket Boys have been brewing up a storm in the folk music world.

She uses her guitar to create staccato rhythms underneath her dazzling soulful vocal melodies, all backed by a pulsing band with unique instrumentation. Her music has been described as ""indie pop with urban beats"", and ""jazz-infused soul pop"" with comparisons ranging from Feist to Nelly Furtado to Norah Jones to Erykah Badu. Since the 2006 release of her debut album, Shudders & Rings, she has been finding her name atop many a music reporter’s list as ""one worth watching"". Her song ""Hey Mister"" was licensed by the City of Austin for inclusion in the Austin Music Vol. 7 compilation CD (March 2008 release). In April 2008, Suzanna Choffel won the $10,000 Grand Prize in the nationwide Famecast Pop competition. Suzanna Choffel’s red-hot band creates a fresh and original instrumental backing.

The low-fi brainchild of Kendall Chloë Eagan. Chloë Sunshine’s debut album Indian Summer was released in December of 2011 and quickly gained international attention with comparisons to bands such as “Cults, Tegan And Sara, Dum Dum Girls and Tennis!,“ (http://www.danceyrselfclean.com). Themes of heartbreak and love lost are clothed in happy melodies and mixed with pop sensibilities to unite classic surf rock aesthetics with summer fun. Singles, “Love, Love, Love” and “Hold Me” have since been featured by such publications as MB! by Mercedes-Benz’s Vision Diamond mixtape and Boston favorite Allston Pudding’s winter 2011 mixtape. Following the success of Indian Summer and graduating from Berklee College of Music, Eagan relocated to New York City and joined forces with current band members Jessica Louise Dye (of D.C.’s Lightfoot) and lead guitarist Natasha Chitayat (Berklee alum, NYC-based music engineer). The trio of 60’s-clad girl rockers have been serenading NYC’s lower east side with fuzzy vintage sounds influenced by Phil Spector, shoegaze and pop music. These ladies perfectly mix jangly guitars, echoing vocals, and melancholy lyrics to achieve a sun soaked, dreamy surf rock sound. Chloe Sunshine will be embarking on a two month national tour to Austin’s SXSW festival in support of a soon to be released limited edition cassette tape.","<p>Chloë Sunshine is the <span class=""caps"">NYC</span> based girl band with a “sun-soaked and surf-tinged Californian feel-good sound.” (Mercedes-Benz Magazine).

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/von-grey","Von Grey","Alpharetta, GA","","Make Some Noise… …a fitting title for von Grey’s inaugural CD. This group of four sisters is creating some amazing “noise” and generating chatter amongst fans and critics. Aim high and then reach higher… is the von Grey motto. They began making music before many children can ride a bicycle and persist in expanding their boundaries and testing their potential. Each of the four sisters began classical instruction at age five. In 2007, they began playing chamber music, under the name Kannafitra. By 2008, they had expanded into Celtic, folk, and Bluegrass – adding vocals and several traditional instruments. In early 2009, they formed the band “von Grey” and the girls have been rocking-out ever since. The past years of practice and exploration have finally “led us to the right place,” says Annika. As the band’s body of original work has increased, von Grey has definitely managed to create a sound of its own. Although seeing themselves very much as a country act, they cite a diverse range of influences – from Lady Antebellum, Ben Harper & Sheryl Crow, to Nickel Creek. von Grey’s original works are rooted in country, yet they manage to weave in creative elements from across musical genres. Being able to create music from within has brought a passion that’s apparent in their recorded music and live performances. Kathryn (16), Annika (14), Fiona (13) and Petra (10) abandon the teen norm of conformity – charting their own path with original ideas, and being comfortable with their individuality. These young ladies represent a new breed of American teenager. They have found a balance in being cool while still being accomplished; sober about the need for hard work and discipline, yet able to keep their sense of humor and youth. Their focus and commitment has paid clear dividends. In 2008, Annika won the top prize in the U.S. 12-and-under Irish fiddler’s competition. In 2009, Annika and Fiona shared the stage at Atlanta’s Fox Theatre with world famous Irish fusion band, The Chieftains. In 2010, von Grey won the LilithFair “Local Talent Search” and opened for Sarah McLachlan. Since then, the band has worked with notable musicians, such as Ed Roland from Collective Soul, and racked up fans and public recognition for their musical talents. The press has been effusive, with descriptions like: “The sister act von Grey was nothing short of stunning… exhibiting poise stratospheres beyond their years.” – Melissa Ruggieri, reviewing von Grey’s Eddie’s Attic show with Ed Roland, for AJC Lifestyle. “So how is the music? Well let’s just say what these four girls lack in life experience, they make up in soul…. There is no doubt these girls have something special…” – Eileen Tilson, writing for Atlanta Music Guide. These four sisters have vastly different personalities, but their passion for music ties them together in a tapestry of creativity, radiating from their souls. They strike an attractive balance, combining a youthful and even elegant femininity with an ability to be assertive and daring – about social causes, teen advocacy, and the pursuit of musical excellence. Their music is equally at home with tight guitar licks, smokin’ violin solos, and rich cello sounds – all combined with 3- and 4- part harmonies and a lyrical dimension embodying a maturity of thought, intellect & expression, while also maintaining down-home accessibility. Four sisters, 12 instruments, family-harmonies, and captivating performances all come together to define von Grey – a musical experience that feels bigger than life.","<p>Make Some Noise…</p> <p>…a fitting title for von Grey’s inaugural CD.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/bernie-worrell","Bernie Worrell","","","Bernie Worrell first came to prominence as a founding member and Musical Director of Parliament/Funkadelic. While this massively influential supergroup was radically altering the course of music, Bernie was radically charting the course of emerging keyboard technology during the golden age of analog synthesis. Among the key ingredients in his sonic stew were perfect pitch and a well-honed facility with the classical canon. A child prodigy who began studying piano at the tender age of three and gave his first public performance just a year later, Worrell wrote his first concerto at age eight and performed with the Washington Symphony Orchestra at ten. His classical studies would continue throughout his adolescence, including private lessons at the Julliard School of Music, before he entered the New England Conservatory of Music. Upon leaving the Conservatory, Worrell served for several years as Musical Director for Maxine Brown before joining George Clinton’s Parliament/Funkadelic crew. Worrell then proceeded to provide this freewheeling collective with a structural foundation which, while occasionally implied, was ever present. At the same time, he explored and expanded his own musical ideas in every conceivable direction with a brazenness which was both revolutionary and evolutionary. From fanciful forays on clavinet which leaped without warning from guttural gulps to squiggly squeals to liquid Minimoog bass lines which herded listeners to the dance floor, it all represented new musical language. All the while, his rapid advancements of the synthesizer’s potential were actually traceable to his classical foundation. “When the synthesizers came about, my having been brought up classically and knowing a full range of orchestra, tympanis and everything, I knew how it sounded and what it felt like. So, if I’m playing a horn arrangement on keyboard, or strings, it sounds like strings or horns, ’cause I know how to phrase it, how a string phrases, different attacks from the aperture for horns, trumpets, sax or trombones.” – Bernie Worrell The hits were many: “Flashlight,” “Atomic Dog,” “Aqua Boogie,” “Cosmic Slop” and “Red Hot Mama” are only a few of the Parliament/Funkadelic classics which Worrell co-wrote, played and co-produced on literally dozens of albums — not to mention his years of wild P-Funk performances, which quickly became the stuff of lore. After departing Parliament/Funkadelic, Worrell resurfaced with the revamped Talking Heads lineup for several albums, including The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, Speaking In Tongues and Jonathan Demme’s dazzling concert film, Stop Making Sense. Worrell’s ominous colorings, this time delivered via new digital keyboards such as the Prophet 5, were central to the recasting of group leader David Byrne’s musical ideas through African rhythms. In the years since he left Talking Heads, Worrell has been a phenomenally prolific studio musician, serving as a primary change-agent in the many experimental works of producer Bill Laswell while contributing his singular flair to projects by the likes of Keith Richards, the Pretenders, Jack Bruce, Deee-Lite and Bootsy’s New Rubber Band. At the same time, he has been among the most sampled musicians ever, with Digital Underground, De La Soul, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, DMX and countless others having acknowledged his timeless grooves by building their tunes around his signature riffs. Worrell also released a series of critically acclaimed solo efforts, including Funk of Ages, Blacktronic Science, Pieces of WOO/The Other Side and Free Agent: A Spaced Odyssey. And he has become quite a sensation on the jam band circuit, playing with groups ranging from Warren Haynes’ Gov’t Mule to Laswell’s Material, Method of Defiance and Praxis conglomerations. In 1997, Worrell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with Parliament/Funkadelic (Talking Heads would follow five years later). That same year, he launched his own group, Bernie Worrell and the WOO Warriors, which has performed all over the US and abroad to rave reviews. The in-concert energy of this ensemble has twice been captured on live albums: Bernie Worrell and the WOO Warriors Live (1998) and True DAT (2002). Worrell’s work has also continued to surface in other places. In 1993, when David Letterman moved his program to CBS, Worrell helped launch the CBS Orchestra with Paul Shaffer. He co-wrote the score for the cult classic, Car 54, Where Are You? and other films, including the Ice Cube vehicle, Friday. In 2003, his music was featured in the NBC television mini-series, Kingpin. The “Wizard of WOO” continues to wear many hats as effortlessly as he mixes musical forms, performing with both Mos Def’s Black Jack Johnson band and Colonel Claypool’s Bucket of Bernie Brains. 2005 saw the release of Stranger: Bernie Worrell on Earth, a documentary film on the life of this master musician. And, between 2009 & 2010, Worrell assembled his latest musical project, SociaLybrium [link]. SociaLybrium is comprised of Bernie on Keyboards, Melvin Gibbs on Bass, Ronny Drayton on Guitar and JT Lewis on drums…….a Rock/Funk/Jazz Fusion Feast!!! To finish off 2010 with a bang, Bernie has just recently debuted another collaboration with guitar prodigy Wes Santo call WesN’Worrell [link]. ~ Larry Alexander For more info: SociaLybrium: For You • for Us • for All on iTunes.

Vocals and bass are provided by Kelly Ogden. On guitar is Luis Cabezas, and Chris Black is on drums. They’ve released 2 albums: Eat My Heart Out (2004) and Because I’m Awesome (2007) They’re currently touring the US promoting their new album. Listen at Last.fm Rock / Punk / Pop Punk The Dollyrots are one girl and two boys. They're a fukin punk band but their CDs are very pop. Kelly is sugar sweet but mischevious and might sucker punch you if you're dumb enough to try her patience. Which she has a lot of, if she hasn't been visiting with her friends Jack, Jim or Jameson. She likes to do girl things like grow plants and sew up her t-shirts and crochet and make strawberry cakes. But, she also likes to play her basses til they are sprinkled with blood and drives soo fast she's not allowed behind the wheel and is getting really good with the balisong she stole from her boss who used it as a letter opener. She likes to get carsick reading and send postcards from the road so send her your address or favorite book (really!). Please don't send it if you don't want The Dollyrots knocking on your door next tour looking for a floor and a shower! Then there is Luis… Luis is mysterious. And very smart. He is one of those guys who you meet and think maybe you'd join his cult. I hear he has his own religion, based on the Sun God so it's not really a stretch. Ask him about it sometime; he'll tell you about freaking that room full of people out while rambling about western religion while on some weird head trip. He is also known to get feisty when he's hungry or afraid he's getting sick. Which he seems to get all the time due to a combo weak immune system/paranoid disposition. He would like a dog when there's room for one on tour. A medium sized one like Snoopy, or maybe just a giant South American Sewage Rat.. It's really easy to get Luis to flinch, he's not crazy about people touching him. Maybe it's because he was abducted when he lived in Ecuador as a child. He likes good brit punk, music of the early 90's because it's honest and don't forget Chuck Berry and Patsy Cline. On the road he likes to read parts of books and stare out the window.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/mime-game","Mime Game","USA","","Mime Game is the long running project of singer/songwriter Dillon Teague DeVoe (formerly of Josephine Collective.) It starts as a manic trip through an insomniac’s head. A weed fueled adventure through sonic landscapes as lush and vibrant as the landscapes they were written in. This project signifies the opening of the head and heart of a man who has given himself to music since he was a kid. No illusions of grandeur. just good music.“Mime Game started humbly in my parents basement during the heydays of Josephine as a project to express another side of my musical prowess as well as an untapped facet of my heart.”The songs started with Sinkin’ and have never since ceased. “The acoustics in the bathroom of my parents basement were perfect for that tight, reverb and i could blow all my hits into the ceiling fan. It’s amazing what kind of stuff you’ll write when your heart is that open and your mind is so comfortable.”Since Mime Game’s conception, Dillon has traveled the country writing a record that has yet to see daylight. Elegantly spanning the subjects of religion (without being preachy,) death (without being morbid,) and the pitfalls and triumphs of being a performer in this day and age, he has found a formula that feels both familiar and fresh.“I’m inspired by a lot of nineties music and pop/punk. I also get down on some Tom Petty and Led Zeppelin. It makes for a really strange brew that sounds way worse than it is. Maybe that’s why we have Manchester Orchestra to thank for a whole new genre of music. Because we all grew up listening to the same shit and it’s all been really eclectic but we all had to find our own ways, individually to express ourselves through music.” “Mime Game really means a lot to me. I’ve been in a lot of bands, but this is more of a projection of my inner self then just a band. I really love this music and I really hate it too sometimes because that’s how i feel about myself. [Mime Game] is my heart on paper.” So there you have it. A sonic eclecticism that is so passionate, it could be said about it that this is a band that was made in the forges of the heart. A band for the ages. And to quote one of Mime Game’s songs, “I think I found my home. Carve a little hole out in my heart for the open road.” Luckily, it sounds like they’re coming your way.","<p>Mime Game is the long running project of singer/songwriter Dillon Teague DeVoe (formerly of Josephine Collective.)

I’ve been in a lot of bands, but this is more of a projection of my inner self then just a band. I really love this music and I really hate it too sometimes because that’s how i feel about myself. [Mime Game] is my heart on paper.” <br /> So there you have it. A sonic eclecticism that is so passionate, it could be said about it that this is a band that was made in the forges of the heart. A band for the ages. And to quote one of Mime Game’s songs, “I think I found my home. Carve a little hole out in my heart for the open road.” Luckily, it sounds like they’re coming your way.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7289872/5c2dead5ffa28a845a84d390ee822268_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/qJ07RkT8NTE?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

Their massive, almost cavernous grungy pop will escape most realistic comparisons, but as the scuzz starts to feverishly build and disseminate on each successive track of ‘Jacker,’ it becomes quickly evident that the songs that frame these livid bursts of punk energy are always worth waiting for.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/youngblood-hawke","Youngblood Hawke","Los Angeles","","Sometimes, you’ll shine the brightest during your darkest hour. That’s exactly what longtime friends multi-instrumentalist Simon Katz and singer Sam Martin came to realize when they commenced writing songs for what would become Youngblood Hawke’s self-titled debut EP. Katz and Martin had seen critical acclaim and worldwide success as founding members of Iglu & Hartly. However, after a rousing performance at Coachella 2010, the group dissolved due to a creative clash. “We went from massive success to nothing over the course of two years,” recalls Katz. “We didn’t like the direction the band was going in, and we wanted to do something closer to our hearts. We had to start over. The only thing you have in times like that is hope.” With hope in their hearts, the duo began feverishly penning songs in Katz’s Los Angeles studio that summer. Galvanized and reinvigorated, they emerged from that sweaty, air conditioner-less room with over one-hundred ideas and a fresh perspective altogether. Martin admits, “We didn’t begin by saying, ‘We’re going to start a new band’. It was more of an outlet to express ourselves. It was the most natural thing I’ve ever done. There was no plan.” There didn’t need to be a plan because their songs were so anthemic and uplifting. In early 2011, they began releasing material and booking local gigs around Los Angeles. Rounded out by Katz’s childhood best friend Tasso on guitar, Alice on backup vocals and live percussion, and Iglu & Hartly touring drummer Nik, the band hit the Roxy for its first show. Based on the strength of the tunes and a completely organic buzz, they sold out a string of nights at Silverlake hotspot, Satellite. Soon, Universal Republic Records contacted them and offered a deal. Their first five-song EP for the label drops August 14, 2012, and it will be followed up by a full-length a year later. Martin describes Youngblood Hawke’s inimitable sound best. “It has elements of pop, rock, indie, dance, and even a little hip hop.” The first single “We Come Running” encapsulates that sentiment. A propulsive beat builds alongside shimmering bells as Martin’s massive refrain soars. “It’s like a personal message to the band,” the vocalist reveals. “It announces that if we work our asses off, they’re going to hear the sound when we come running. We’re going to get our chance.” Elsewhere, “Dannyboy” is a tribute to a friend who tragically passed, while “Rootless” finds freedom in starting anew over an echoing riff and huge chorus. “It was one of the first tracks Sam and I wrote together during that first summer,” says Katz. “We didn’t have a foundation anymore after our last project. We were feeling rootless, but we were free.” The quintet’s moniker also reflects the glorious serendipity at the heart of its journey. Nodding to the Herman Wouk novel of the same name, it’s utterly a propos. “I was looking for a new book to read,” remembers Martin. “My dad called me out of the blue, and he was like, ‘Your uncle’s favorite book is Youngblood Hawke. You have to read it’. From the first page, it really hit me. It’s about a Kentucky mountain boy who wants to become a writer so he moves to New York. Simon and I moved from Colorado where we were going to college and immersed ourselves in this crazy L.A. landscape. It really resonated with us as a story about an artist finding his way.” At the end of the day, these artists have found their way in Youngblood Hawke, and the path is brighter than ever. “We’ve seen the bottom and the top,” concludes Katz. “Things get bad, and then they get good again. The music is about being hopeful and never giving up.”","<p>Sometimes, you’ll shine the brightest during your darkest hour.</p> <p>That’s exactly what longtime friends multi-instrumentalist Simon Katz and singer Sam Martin came to realize when they commenced writing songs for what would become Youngblood Hawke’s self-titled debut EP.

However, after a rousing performance at Coachella 2010, the group dissolved due to a creative clash.</p> <p>“We went from massive success to nothing over the course of two years,” recalls Katz. “We didn’t like the direction the band was going in, and we wanted to do something closer to our hearts. We had to start over. The only thing you have in times like that is hope.”</p> <p>With hope in their hearts, the duo began feverishly penning songs in Katz’s Los Angeles studio that summer. Galvanized and reinvigorated, they emerged from that sweaty, air conditioner-less room with over one-hundred ideas and a fresh perspective altogether. Martin admits, “We didn’t begin by saying, ‘We’re going to start a new band’. It was more of an outlet to express ourselves. It was the most natural thing I’ve ever done. There was no plan.”</p> <p>There didn’t need to be a plan because their songs were so anthemic and uplifting. In early 2011, they began releasing material and booking local gigs around Los Angeles. Rounded out by Katz’s childhood best friend Tasso on guitar, Alice on backup vocals and live percussion, and Iglu & Hartly touring drummer Nik, the band hit the Roxy for its first show.</p> <p>Based on the strength of the tunes and a completely organic buzz, they sold out a string of nights at Silverlake hotspot, Satellite. Soon, Universal Republic Records contacted them and offered a deal. Their first five-song EP for the label drops August 14, 2012, and it will be followed up by a full-length a year later.</p> <p>Martin describes Youngblood Hawke’s inimitable sound best. “It has elements of pop, rock, indie, dance, and even a little hip hop.”</p> <p>The first single “We Come Running” encapsulates that sentiment. A propulsive beat builds alongside shimmering bells as Martin’s massive refrain soars. “It’s like a personal message to the band,” the vocalist reveals. “It announces that if we work our asses off, they’re going to hear the sound when we come running. We’re going to get our chance.”</p> <p>Elsewhere, “Dannyboy” is a tribute to a friend who tragically passed, while “Rootless” finds freedom in starting anew over an echoing riff and huge<br /> chorus. “It was one of the first tracks Sam and I wrote together during that first summer,” says Katz. “We didn’t have a foundation anymore after our last project. We were feeling rootless, but we were free.”</p> <p>The quintet’s moniker also reflects the glorious serendipity at the heart of its<br /> journey. Nodding to the Herman Wouk novel of the same name, it’s utterly a propos.</p> <p>“I was looking for a new book to read,” remembers Martin. “My dad called me out of the blue, and he was like, ‘Your uncle’s favorite book is Youngblood Hawke. You have to read it’. From the first page, it really hit me. It’s about a Kentucky mountain boy who wants to become a writer so he moves to New York. Simon and I moved from Colorado where we were going to college and immersed ourselves in this crazy L.A. landscape. It really resonated with us as a story about an artist finding his way.”</p> <p>At the end of the day, these artists have found their way in Youngblood Hawke, and the path is brighter than ever. “We’ve seen the bottom and the top,” concludes Katz. “Things get bad, and then they get good again. The music is about being hopeful and never giving up.”</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/5393443/da0014140ce1c5f830eb4ce79414fc52_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/6ECw5DTULQ8?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

""We approach the band differently now than we did before the hiatus. There’s no pressure on us the way we do it: We all have other sources of income, and mostly aren’t dependent on the Hips making money at shows. I think of us as ‘musicians of leisure.’"" Formed nearly 15 years ago at Chico State in Northern California, The Mother Hips have seen it all, and there are already two documentaries about them-Stories We Could Tell and This Is The Sound-to prove it. They’ve gone from dorm band to buzz band to cult favorite; they’ve taken a truckload of drugs and then kicked their habits; they’ve played with everyone from Wilco to Johnny Cash; they’ve worked with countless labels (including two albums on Rick Rubin’s American Recordings); and they’ve dealt with more industry bullshit than the average band could handle. And when singer/guitarist Greg Loiacono told his bandmates he wanted to take a break following the release of 2001’s critically acclaimed Green Hills Of The Earth, it seemed as though the Hips were on their way to getting thrown into the coulda-woulda-shoulda pile. But with the release of the band’s new seven-inch and EP on New York City upstart Camera Records, it’s clear that The Mother Hips (Bluhm, Loiacono, drummer John Hofer and bassist Paul Hoaglin) aren’t just back-they’re back with a purpose. ""Red Tandy,"" ""Blue Tomorrow"" and the EP-only ""Colonized"" are all perfect examples of the group’s ability to channel such classic bands as The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, The Band and The Beach Boys while writing thoughtful and beautiful tunes that sound just as timeless as the Hips’ inspirations. And, of course, the guys still have something to say. ""‘Colonized’ is about the human soul clashing with the incredible greed that thrives our culture,‘"" says Bluhm. ""Anything that’s cool or appealing is instantly ‘colonized’ by advertisers until we become almost afraid to express an original idea for fear that it will be used to sell fucking coffee or surf trunks."" The quartet’s first release in four years features songs-two on the vinyl, four on the CD (including an alternate version of ""Red Tandy"")-written both collaboratively and separately, and is an excellent appetizer for a new full-length LP slated to be issued next year. If the Hips sound creatively energized amidst all the harmony-drenched, California-baked rock, it’s because they are. ""Greg is my favorite person to play music with and one of my favorite songwriters,"" notes Bluhm. ""We started out together. You only have one of those guys per life. Sometimes I feel like I can’t even sing unless he’s singing with me."" ""Toward the end of 2001, it had become ‘work’ and it didn’t feel right-we were all so bitter all of the time,"" says Loiacono. ""Now when we come together to play, there’s true happiness in seeing each other, and in creating new sounds and feelings for ourselves and for the fans that come to hear us."" Though all four members remain busy with the other projects they launched during the hiatus-including Bluhm’s solo career, Loiacono and Hoaglin’s Sensations, and Bluhm and Loiacono’s Ball-Point Birds-expect plenty of activity from the Hips in the near future. And count on witnessing them having a blast.

All the current members of Eliquate have been practicing independently since highschool, however it wasnt until late 2008 that MC Elliot Wright and Producer Jamie Schnetzler met and began collaborating. Quite slowly I might add. Wright found an interest in writing and MC’ing towards the end of high school and began fevershly recording as much as possible over mostly self-produced garage band tracks. Schnetzler started off playing guitar for a local band High Society which gained some noteriety opening for established locals such as Dub congress and the Expendables. By spring 2009 Eliquate (then Jamie and Elliot) was being offered shows, but the ipod just wasnt cutting it as back-up. Something was missing. Shortly after the two began having sit-ins for drums, bass, and dj, but it wasnt until late, 2009 that a consitant backing band was committed to performing and writing. With the addition of Cosmo Stevens (founder of Oak Park) on bass and Dan Wells (inventor of DMT) on Drums. Tanner Christiansen has recently been added to the groups lineup. he specializes in a synthesis of sampling and light/visual manipulation, as well as keys and percussion. In 2009, Wright traveled to Philadelphia to compete in the National Slam Poetry Contest, earning a highly respectable 5th place.. Having performed with Del, Souls of Mischief, and members of the Living Legends, Zion-I, Nickatina, and Murs, Eliqute brings a flavorful new taste to hip hop table. Drawing inspiration from life, beauty, pain, and experience, Eliquate’s sound is live and real. Their performance is exorbitantly energetic and tangible, while their style is finessed.

At least that’s the visual a stereotypical inauguration tends to suggest. But there’s nothing conventional about Rachel & The Kings, and the dynamo-style start the band boasts is no exception. Consider: with less than two months of official togetherdom, Rachel & The Kings won Ford’s national “Gimme the Gig II” competition, earning huge accolades from legendary producer (and head judge) Don Was. Not to mention becoming the de facto stars of “Gimme the Gig II,” set to air on KTLA in late July, 2012. What explains such immediate and extraordinary success is a confluence of talent culled from piles of musical endowment accumulating around Denver these days. Rachel James, already an established singer / songwriter, initially teamed up with friend and producer Joey Barba (lead guitarist of former band Tickle Me Pink). As production on her first full-length album progressed, the need for formidable players to complement the music’s intense construction became clear, and Barba called upon Stefan Runstrom, also of Tickle Me Pink fame, to track drums. With the eventual addition of two other notable Colorado players – Ian Short, violin player and long-time collaborator alongside Rachel, with former status playing violin for Hello Kavita and Noah Matthews, former bass player on the Alan Baird Project – the proverbial circle was complete. And as often occurs in these charmed circumstances, the group chemistry was simply something too potent for anyone to ignore. James, Barba, Runstrom, Short and Matthews all agreed that they had to take their talents outside the studio and due justice to the dynamic sound already found behind its walls. And thus began Rachel & The Kings, a young person’s super-group who proves worthy of that superlative moniker. Their live shows make fun feel justified, a sort of mature approach to having a rather rockin’ good time. Their songwriting finesse and musical artistry set the band on a playing field that’s really all their own. But what separates Rachel & The Kings the most from other bands is the real joy onstage they seem to experience themselves. It’s a relief to see the band is in on what you already know: that this is great stuff. Rachel & The Kings’ debut album is set for release late 2012/early 2013, with nationwide performances to follow.","<p>You’d think a band yet to celebrate its first birthday would be bickering over whose basement is best for practice sessions.

Obsessive, eccentric, indulgent: they’re all equally fair. If Parenthetical Girls have learned anything over the course of their bewilderingly unorthodox discography, it’s that they are-for richer or for poorer-a necessarily singular pop group. It’s a peculiarity that they’ve learned to embrace-a single-minded conviction that pours itself over every corner of their latest album,Privilege.<span style=""font-family: Arial""> Having taken pop extravagance to its logical conclusion with their critically acclaimed, orchestral pop opus Entanglements, Privilege finds a newly emboldened Parenthetical Girls giving the orchestra their leave-abrazen reinvention as immediate as it is inspired. Returning to its core membership of vocalist/creative director Zac Pennington and producer/arranger Jherek Bischoff (composer and collaborator with David Byrne, Amanda Palmer, Xiu Xiu, etc.), Privilege retains the group’s signature ambitions-visceral intimacy, camp austerity, lurid eloquence-while confidently embracing the perfect pop pastiche their previous records only alluded to. Anchored by Pennington’s distinctively lilting vibrato, Privilege is a cascade of grim particulars and gallows humor-an unflinching treatise on privilege, indiscretion, betrayal, sex and class politics, failure, and resignation. This is Parenthetical Girls in fighting trim: unbridled, unambiguous, and with a new creative candor that’s felt in both its words and music. Originally recorded and self-released as a sequence of five self-contained, extremely limited 12"" EPs (each heroically hand-numbered in the blood of the group’s members, and available only through direct mailorder) the ambitious Privilege series was a grand and unequivocally impractical achievement. Privilege condenses the 21 recordings of the original series to a single, 12-track, remixed and remastered statement of purpose: a bold, strikingly cohesive pop clarion call that further solidifies Parenthetical Girls’ place amongst the most surprising and uncompromising pop groups at work today.

After all they formed in a Brooklyn apartment thousands of miles to the east, and their guitarist has never even seen the Pacific Ocean. There are aspects of the band’s sound—abrasive guitar hooks, immediate drumming, and incessant codas—that speak to living in a big city. But there’s also a dreary sparseness, a David Lynch-esque darkness, culled from the other members’ native Washington.Singer/songwriter Molly Hamilton grew up in an old house in Tacoma, drummer Michael Stasiak in nearby Lakewood. While grunge put Seattle on the map and Riot Grrl and the DIY aesthetic are synonymous with Olympia, Tacoma remains grittier, darker even. Infamous for the acrid smell of its paper mills, this blue-collar city somehow fosters a fertile music community—if few outsiders know about it. Michael and Molly first crossed paths in that tight-knit scene, both contributing to a local compilation label. The label lasted all of one summer before half its roster decamped for New York.There, three summers later, Michael approached Molly about starting a new band. Molly’s crippling stage fright and inexperience with the electric guitar seemed good excuses to decline, but at Michael’s urging she bought a used Danelectro and put pen to paper. Soon after, Michael invited guitarist Robert Earl Thomas to a tentative first practice. Though Robert had to plug his guitar into the stereo, and Michael played only two drums, something was palpable in that first hour. They chose a name Molly had picked months before, and Widowspeak was born.The band’s skeletal sound began to take shape, with Robert’s rust-belt guitar parts lending a restless, sinister edge to Molly’s subdued melodies and soft vocal style. Writing became a collaborative effort, and Widowspeak racked up an arsenal of songs. By fall the trio had recorded a six-track cassette using only a built-in laptop microphone and Garageband. The self-released October Tape, as it was called, fell into the hands of Brooklyn’s Captured Tracks. Weeks later, after only their sixth show, Widowspeak recorded the 7” single, “Harsh Realm,” in anticipation of a full LP.That album, recorded at Rear House with Jarvis Taveniere of Woods, documents Widowspeak’s inaugural year. In a relaxed studio setting songs born from those first jittery practices could breathe. The trio expanded their modest instrumentation while retaining a sparse aesthetic. The resulting record offers an eerie ambience, at times channeling 1950’s jukebox pop, at others, 1960’s psychedelia. While garnering comparisons to slow-moving 1990’s acts such as Mazzy Star or Cat Power, Widowspeak have defined a sound that’s earnestly nostalgic, and increasingly confident. Even so, these are songs about heartache. They are songs about homesickness, about longing for pine forests, reckless youth, and dark nights in strange cities.","<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: times, 'new york', serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16.950000762939453px; "">To say that Widowspeak is a Northwest band is to tell a half-truth.

The youngest of 3 brothers, Luke’s parents encouraged their sons to pick up musical instruments. Piano, saxophone, guitar and the flute were all part of the Sital-Singh ensemble with Luke taking up the violin at age 11. After picking up his brothers guitar, he has never looked back.

Early supporters of Giraffage’s screwed-down soundscapes, sample-based pop music and future R&B include such publications as Pitchfork, XLR8R, The Fader and Gorilla vs. Bear. After an extensive tour with the artist xxyyxx through Europe last year, Giraffage has big plans for 2013, with numerous upcoming performance dates including a Brooklyn Vegan showcase at SXSW and at Los Angeles’ world-renowned Low End Theory club night.

And for this rising star, the payoff could not have been sweeter than one magical night this past February when he stepped on stage at the legendary Texas Hall of Fame in Bryan, TX, where so many heavyweights had stood before him, to record his latest release. For over 27 years, the Texas Hall of Fame has played host to the likes of Alan Jackson, Chris Ledoux, Gary Allan and many more. Playing before a sell-out crowd of more than 2,000 people, Aaron delivered a scorching performance that marked the culmination of a relentless touring schedule, including more than 500 shows in 11 states over two years. 800 fans were turned away that night as the venue reached capacity, but thankfully, now everyone can share in the excitement of that evening with Aaron Watsons latest release, Live At The Texas Hall of Fame. Live At The Texas Hall Of Fame is the follow-up to Aarons highly successful 2004 release The Honky Tonk Kid, which was produced by Ray Benson of Asleep at the Wheel and featured Willie Nelson. I feel like our live show is the foundation on which my career has been built, says Aaron. Since its such a big part of what we do, it was natural for the next record to be live. Fans will definitely get their moneys worth from Live At The Texas Hall Of Fame. The album features 19 songs, including ALL of his hits like Off The Record and Reckless, as well as new material. I made this album using the same philosophy that I use for my live shows. I always want to give the fans the most music and best show I can for their money, because more likely than not, they had to work hard for it says Aaron. Whats next? Rest assured that an aggressive touring schedule always tops his list. Still, no matter where he travels or how successful he gets, Aaron always stays true to his roots and the values he had when he started out. Born in Amarillo, TX and raised on country music, Aarons first musical influence came from singing old gospel hymns at church. Later, inspiration came from Willie, Waylon, Merle, George, andGeorge. While attending college at Abilene Christian University and playing baseball, Aaron began to hone his vocal and musical skills, earning his chops on the local honky-tonk circuit and developing a strong local following in the process. It was also during that time that he became serious about songwriting, collaborating often with his close friend Neal Lowry. Aaron has come a long way in a short time. A few years ago, he was traveling to gigs in a rental van with a modest 4-piece band. These days, he owns his own tour bus and shares the stage with 6 ace players in a full-blown band featuring fiddle and steel guitar. His touring base and radio airplay have extended beyond the borders of Texas to include Oklahoma, Louisiana, Wyoming, Tennessee, Kentucky, and North Carolina. With nearly 200 shows this year on the schedule, Aaron Watson is sure to play a date near you soon. If you get a chance to see him in action, it wont be hard to see why The Honky Tonk Kid is blazing such a hot trail across the country. Youll also be glad that when youre left wanting more, you can simply get in your car, turn on your stereo, and pop in a copy of Aaron Watsons new CD Live At The Texas Hall of Fame.","As one of Texas' hottest young touring acts, Aaron Watson has earned his musical stripes the hard way; on the road, traveling thousands of miles to hundreds of honky-tonks across the Southwest and beyond.

Field Tripp has seen several cast changes over the past four years; originally starting as a “Power Folk Pop” trio, and later expanding to a 7-10 member collective, Field Tripp, much like Krishna, has been known to take many forms. One member, Dan Allmond, has remained constant. Currently Field Tripp is comprised of Dan Allmond (guitar/vocals), Eliz Christy (vocals, keys). Brian Mabry (multi-instrumentalist), Paul Balazs (bass) and Amir Azzabi (drums). Long time followers of Field Tripp say that the current lineup is the tightest, most entertaining, and together-sounding group there has been since Field Tripp’s incepetion. In January of 2011, the band self-produced and released their first album “Super-Ego Friendly”. Field Tripp has a sound with roots in modern indie rock with hints of folk, surf rock, country and club beats.","<p>The Phoenix-based Field Tripp has been creating music since forming in the summer of 2007.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/bad-lucy","Bad Lucy","Phoenix, AZ","","By early 2008, after a young adulthood spent exploring folk sensibilities, channeling idols such as Townes Van Zandt and Elliott Smith, J. Miller had almost entirely abandoned music. His post-collegiate trip westward temporarily quieted his pursuit as the diverse Arizona music scene left him wondering where he would fit. It took a year of quiet observation before Miller was ready to delve in once again with a start at local coffeehouses and bars. The same diversity that at first gave him pause now inspired experiments with sound and style. By the fall of 2009, he dusted off tracks from his early days and released The Eventually EP. The subsequent release party would lead to the casting of Bad Lucy. Bassist Alex Kyhn brought his mix of jazz, soul and rock stylings to Miller’s band for the first time that night, and the duo’s musical chemistry was confirmed at spots like The Modified Arts and Lost Leaf in the winter of 2009. Kyhn’s admiration for the simplicity of singer/songwriters Nick Drake and Fink and the way both “artists use their acoustic guitars to set the tone for their songs,” made the connection with Miller a natural one. And the Colorado native’s tendency to find inspiration in everything, from the paintings of Dali to the use of space and contrast in his favorite jazz compositions, would lead the coming transition to a melodic collective. Kyhn and Miller spent the next several months trying out local musicians as part of the backing band for Miller’s solo project. Alex Lee was the one that stuck. With influences ranging from Chad Sexton and Billy Cobham to Buddy Rich and Ralph Hardimon, the drummer’s marching, jazz and rock roots added a unique layer. Lee became a staple, and the guys opened for names such as Sarah Jaffe, The Stone Foxes, Brendan James and The Love Language…often with new arrangements of Miller’s original material. Thanks to their collaborative rehearsals, a new sound was emerging. The next step was clear: a band. The trio planned a month off to write and record, but it wasn’t until their last show as J. Miller and band that the group’s new moniker was solidified. An abandoned puppy was in the audience that night. With only a muddy rope around her neck and no one to claim her, Miller took her home. She was dubbed Lucy, and as she terrorized the rehearsal space, she quickly became the band’s new muse.","<p>By early 2008, after a young adulthood spent exploring folk sensibilities, channeling idols such as Townes Van Zandt and Elliott Smith, J.

They are coming out of retirement for this young group brimming with talent, enthusiasm, and freshness” (French-Webzine “Progressia”). In a world strangled by mediocrity and distraction, Captain Squeegee leads a legacy to push the boundaries of music and bend the rules of the industry itself. Since their mysterious formation in 2003, they have allowed fate to arrange their current line-up (no original members), which has since performed hundreds of shows and festivals, released two albums, and manifested multiple music videos. Even before birthing their internationally acclaimed full length, Nothing vs Everything (2008), the band has made numerous journeys across the southwest with an intent to infect the people with their unique sound and offer something seriously different to the artistic community. Their progressive blend of multi-instrumentation and conceptualized orchestrations have been described as “Fantasia music, with lead singer Danny Torgersen making like Mickey in a swirling maelstrom of flying horns, dancing guitars, broken melodies, and mad-prophet vocalizing” (Phoenix New Times), and was even awarded “Best album of 2008” and “Best hope of 2009” by French Webzine-“Progressia”. Recently, they have paired up with the “Lucidity Web-Saga” as actors and musicians, even writing it’s theme song, “Your Own Invention”, which they recorded in a pyramid. Forever in stark contrast to the robotic, zombie infested waters of the mass media and mainstream, Squeegee will continue to offer a new age perspective, driving their fans and future fans to open the mind’s eye (and ear)… and “See More Clearly”.","<p>“The Gods of Music are not dead!

Aeroplane’s debut album, We Can’t Fly, was an in-depth trip into the previously mentioned balearics with a big dose of AOR and Moroder-influenced disco, which was more a statement than an attempt to conquer dance floors, though the perfect remix cast did fill up for that job (The Krays’s remix of Superstar, Breakbot’s remix of ” Without Lies ” or Rex The Dog remix of “My Enemy”). Now that our appetites have been whetted by those brief, tantalising excursions, what delights await us for the long-haul flight? As a DJ, Aeroplane has never been at the mercy of traditional bpms, and being free of “the dancefloor pressure” has given Vito additional license to slow things down and look around, finding the perfect blend between club music, pop hooks, and spaced-out soundscapes. Making your ass shake more than your fist pump, as his first “In Flight Entertainment” 100% exclusive compilation demonstrates. The start of Vito’s own label Aeropop will see many collaborations with big names and a fresh, exciting, variety of music come out, allowing Vito to flex his classically trained musical muscles in all directions, just like his touring schedule.","<p>In just a few years, Vito De Luca, the Italian-Belgian producer behind Aeroplane, has established himself as party-starting DJ, remixer du jour, with his spacious cosmic-disco remakes of Grace Jones (William’s Blood), Friendly Fires (Paris) and Sebastien Tellier (Kilometer), and, via his own keyboards riff-based melancholic beauties like Caramellas, or My Enemy, leader of the nu-disco and Balearica scene.

For the occasion Maxime got together with American soul singer/violinist Marques Toliver (Bella Union, Bat For Lashes, Grizzly Bear, Holly Miranda, Mechanical Bride), to create a piece of hedonistic house that is entirely characteristic of his style. Spontaneous, positive, natural, open to large spaces, ambitious but always accessible. “All these elements are the common denominator of my music”, explains Maxime, who brought out his first maxi singles on the Belgian ‘Dirty Dancing Rccordings’ label in 2005. “In my productions, I naturally search for originality, but also simplicity, efficiency, emotion and some sort of positive melancholy.” Born in 1983 in Liège, Belgium, Maxime Firket grew up surrounded by music. He studied music theory and classical music at the Academy and did not choose the easy route by opting to study the cello. “A demanding and monodic instrument which forces you to find the right sound and the right note to make yourself heard. My cello background is still useful to me today.” As an adolescent, he dreamt of playing in a rock group, but also discovered Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode, Front 242 and Detroit techno. After having created his own studio and put together a few mixes on a Roland Compuphonic synthesiser (yes, that’s where the name comes from…), Maxime soon found himself behind the decks at Dirty Dancing nights in Brussels and recorded his first tracks for Dirty Dancing Recordings. In 2006, his reputation exploded on the dance floor with the groovy “Emotion”, produced in collaboration with Tiga and released on his label ‘Turbo’. Maxime has his finger in lots of different pies and is equally at ease at festivals as in the studio. In addition, Compuphonic has done different remixes for Crystal Fighters, Martin Solveig, The Presets, Arsenal and dEUS which are played by the crème de la crème. In 2008, he broadened his horizons due to his involvement with the Belgian rock group Montevideo for the album MVSC that they went on to promote throughout the country. It’s in the Vervier countryside, in Theux, that Maxime heads up the Union Match label. The label produces his music along with that of Fabrice Lig, Spirit Catcher, Kolombo, and Ante Perry.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-last-bison","The Last Bison","Chesapeake, VA","indie, folk, indie folk","Ben Hardesty doesn’t look the part of a rock star as he navigates a rickety tractor through the sprawling ranch where he grew up and fell in love with music. On the edge of The Great Dismal Swamp, Hardesty developed his spirit of adventure, and passion for doing things a bit differently. His father, Dan gave him a guitar when he was two, and later told him, “It doesn’t matter if you play it right, just make it sound good!” Not the typical teaching method, but then again, The Last Bison is anything but typical.The seven-member ensemble led by Ben has seemingly risen from the marshes of southeastern Virginia to captivate the national music scene with a rare blend of folk that is poetically steeped in classical influences. Band members describe the sound as “mountain-top chamber.”Already the band has drawn flattering though imperfect comparisons to indie rock superstars the likes of Mumford & Sons, The Decemberists and Fleet Foxes. Flattering because each of those bands has carried folk rock into the mainstream; imperfect because none of them have a front man that shares the stage with his father and sister, nor uses a 75-year-old chaplain’s pump organ and Bolivian goat toenails on stage. The Last Bison is a tight knit community of family and friends that boasts a sound all its own.A blogger for the popular music sharing site, Noise trade, remarked: “Bison has already crafted a sound that is threaded with their own singular strands of creativity. Songs like ‘In Your Room,’ ‘Switzerland,’ ‘The Woodcutter’s Son’ and ‘River Rhine’ all unfurl in textured, poetic waves that are based far more in inspiration than imitation.”Another critic, for Folk hive, writes: “Bison is a welcome respite from all that is manufactured.”Ben appears every bit the man to lead such an outfit. His husky frame and thick facial hair match his gravelly yet soulful voice.

On the edge of The Great Dismal Swamp, Hardesty developed his spirit of adventure, and passion for doing things a bit differently. His father, Dan gave him a guitar when he was two, and later told him, “It doesn’t matter if you play it right, just make it sound good!” Not the typical teaching method, but then again, The Last Bison is anything but typical.<br><br>The seven-member ensemble led by Ben has seemingly risen from the marshes of southeastern Virginia to captivate the national music scene with a rare blend of folk that is poetically steeped in classical influences. Band members describe the sound as “mountain-top chamber.”<br>Already the band has drawn flattering though imperfect comparisons to indie rock superstars the likes of Mumford & Sons, The Decemberists and Fleet Foxes. Flattering because each of those bands has carried folk rock into the mainstream; imperfect because none of them have a front man that shares the stage with his father and sister, nor uses a 75-year-old chaplain’s pump organ and Bolivian goat toenails on stage. The Last Bison is a tight knit community of family and friends that boasts a sound all its own.<br>A blogger for the popular music sharing site, Noise trade, remarked: “Bison has already crafted a sound that is threaded with their own singular strands of creativity. Songs like ‘In Your Room,’ ‘Switzerland,’ ‘The Woodcutter’s Son’ and ‘River Rhine’ all unfurl in textured, poetic waves that are based far more in inspiration than imitation.”<br>Another critic, for Folk hive, writes: “Bison is a welcome respite from all that is manufactured.”<br>Ben appears every bit the man to lead such an outfit. His husky frame and thick facial hair match his gravelly yet soulful voice. He drives a 1989 wood-paneled station wagon – the muffler fell off during an off-road escapade – and he brews mead in his family’s kitchen.<br>He’s joined by a cast of family and close friends – drawing authenticity from many nights spent jamming around backyard bonfires, spontaneously creating music in the living room, and leading songs with the extended community at their local church.<br>The Last Bison’s live shows transport audiences from urban music halls to another, less familiar, era.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/tez-mcclain","Tez McClain","Atlanta, Georgia","","Cortez an undeniably gifted artist, Cortez “Tez” McClain has been grabbing the attention of music’s most prominent figures since his youth. Hailing from Atlanta, the South’s renowned music capital, Tez has established himself as a multi-talented artist with a natural, charismatic stage presence. Since parting ways with his former rap group and adopting the nickname “Brand Name”, as a solo artist Tez McClain’s popularity has been steadily on the rise. Tez has claimed titles at several talent showcases while performing at many popular venues in the Southeast. After captivating the ears of some of Atlanta’s industry elite, Tez began working with accomplished producers and executives including DTP’s Chaka Zulu, LT-Moe, Maestro and Focus. The rapper’s first single, “I’m Fly” garnered regional attention, leading to appearances on a variety of mixtapes and consistent club plays. “I’m Fly” eventually won the Hot 107.9 Battleground contest so many consecutive times that it officially retired with the title of Battleground Champion, with Tez achieving the same title again in 2009 for “Booty Call.” Tez went on to have two appearances on MTV’s Sucker Free Sunday’s, and ultimately won the Mountain Dew Sucker Free Challenge – all while attending college full-time. After graduating, Tez released his mixtape, Wishful Thinking Vol. 1, alongside fellow CAU alumnus, DJ Don Cannon. Getting rave reviews and write ups, Wishful Thinking Vol. 1 was featured on several blogs and websites such as XXLMag.com, HipHopdx.com, AllHipHop.com, and SlamOnline.com, among others. Unconstrained, the Atlanta-native performed on stages across the nation during the Back to the Future Tour opening for Opio (of legendary group Souls of Mischief) and Bay Area artist Mistah F.A.B. Tez’s latest single, “Jordans & and Gold Chain” further declares his “Brand Name.” Reaping thousands of views and listens, the song is a glaring example of Tez’s ability to deliver contemporary messages in a way that continues to appeal to fans. “I like to have an emotional connection with my listeners. I want to talk to them like I know what they’re going through. I believe that, in an emotional aspect, everybody goes through the same things. Everybody’s felt shame, love, happiness, guilt, doubt, and lust.” Tez is presently working on his next mixtape, Wishful Thinking Vol. 2: Respect My Grind (RMG). The mixtape, to be released in early 2012, will feature G.O.O.D Music’s Cyhi The Prynce, among others. In 2012, Tez McClain is sure to flood the scene as he upholds his trademark as a brand name.","<p>Cortez an undeniably gifted artist, Cortez “Tez” McClain has been grabbing the attention of music’s most prominent figures since his youth.

But to Young Lyxx it is all too natural. His early acquaintance with the music industry, numerous years of recording experience, a refreshingly pure talent, his love of music, and unbridled hard work makes Young Lyxx confident that he will be able to accomplish this mission. Lennix Nelson Rogers Jr. (Young Lyxx) was born on August 16, 1989 in San Diego, California. He grew up listening to the popular sounds of the late 80s/early 90s. His family moved to New Orleans when he was just 6 years old, but this move would prove to be instrumental in his development as a rapper. He was first introduced to the music known as bounce by placing his ear to the door of his older cousin, Yorri Berrys, bedroom and listening to her rap original work in the late hours. Soon after, Lyxx began writing original work of his own. At age 11, Lyxx and his parents returned to San Diego, California. Music, always his first love, made room for a second love, basketball. During off-season, Lyxx worked diligently on his first recorded CD. He was hooked on being in the studio. By age 13, he was introduced to the stage for the first time, rounding off his experiences. The overwhelmingly positive feedback confirmed his suspicion that this is what he was born to do. He began to pursue music, vehemently. Recording on computer mics served as good practice for what was yet to come. At age 16, Lyxx linked up with other artists. Their first professionally mixed song was entitled, Wait A Minute where he was featured with Aaron TaEa$t Evans and Cairo McGee. The three clicked and eventually brought Mark Chicago Beard into the operation. Lyxx worked on an album recording with friend, James jBoy Daniels(anup and coming producer from Oceanside, California).jBoyintroduced Lyxx to Pro-Tools. From there Lyxx picked up his own unique recording habits. Lyxx acceptance to Clark-Atlanta University forced a move to the Peachtree state. Juggling the demands of college, a thriving social life, and a rap career was made a little easier because of: • the mentorship he received from rapper and former NFL player Reggie Famouz Stephens, • his work ethic instilled by his loving parents Lennix Sr. and Kim, • his sheer determination to succeed, • the constant study of his craft Young Lyxx states, being perfect is impossible, but I want to be as close as I can get. Lyxx plans to introduce a new sound to the industry and with a successful mixtape (Rosaries On The Dresser), climaxing to 1M+ plays on Myspace, multiple shows with other up and coming artist such as, B.O.B., J. Cole, Mickey Factz, Donnis, Big Krit, Nefu Da Don, Wiz Khalifa, Dom Kennedy, and others, a strong team behind him (Top Heavy U.), support from clothing lines such as Chilly-O, Fli Pelican, Rock Smith Tokyo, and others, he is confident that his music is ready to be heard by the discerning ears of the world. His musical impact in Atlanta has also caught the attention of BROKE AND BOUJEE’s own “Fadia Kader.” Broke and Boujee is a five year old party going strong between Atlanta and Chicago for some of the best musicians, artist, clothing labels and “it” girls and boys. “When I make my way into the game, Im bringing my bags to settle in, because Im not going nowhere.” His enthusiasm topped off with talent makes all those who have come into contact with him, BELIEVE that he is here to stay!","<p>Being a California kid and infusing a new sound into the south may be a seemingly difficult task.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/skylar-grey","Skylar Grey","Mezomaine, WI","alternative, female vocalists, alternative rock","Skylar Grey is a singer/songwriter whose recent breakout performance on the GRAMMY Awards alongside Dr. Dre and Eminem for their newest single, “I Need A Doctor,” has elevated her into the spotlight, beyond her writing credits, as a phenomenal, critically-acclaimed singer. In addition to “I Need a Doctor,” which she also wrote, Grey can currently be heard on several tracks for songs that she penned including Lupe Fiasco’s “Words I Never Said,” and Diddy Dirty Money’s “Coming Home.” The recent GRAMMY performance is just one of many milestone moments in what has been a whirlwind year for Grey, who was also nominated for two GRAMMY Awards that evening for “Song of the Year” and “Best Rap Song,” for writing Eminem and Rihanna’s “Love the Way You Lie.” A fateful introduction by Grey’s publisher at Universal to producer extraordinaire Alex Da Kid via email, lead to the pair writing their first song together, “Love the Way You Lie.” “I didn’t write it with Rihanna in mind, I just wrote what I felt over the beat, thinking that I would sing it,” said Grey. “I felt honored that Eminem was drawn to the song because I’ve always respected him as an artist.” Grey went on to write Rihanna’s Part II and Part III of the same song for Rihanna’s Loud album. Grey and Alex de Kid have since become a duo to be reckoned with in the world of song writing. In addition to Fiasco’s controversial “Words I Never Said,” and Diddy Dirty Money’s “Home,” Grey is also credited with writing “Castle Walls” for TI, featuring Christina Aguilera. Even prior to her captivating GRAMMY performance, buzz about Grey as a singer had begun to pique in the last couple months, following a release of her original demo of “Love the Way You Lie” on AOL, which quickly became an online hit. The release lined up with the Dr. Dre and Eminem single, “I Need a Doctor,” from Dr. Dre’s long awaited Detox album hitting radio and a leak of Fiasco’s “Words I Never Said” from his forthcoming Lasers album, all of which subsequently found Grey as a #2 trending topic on twitter worldwide, a feat she also accomplished the night of her GRAMMY performance. Grey was born and raised in a tiny village in Wisconsin and has been performing since the age of 6. She left home as a teenager pursuing music as a career. Aside from having one of the most heart-rendering voices in music, she plays nearly a dozen instruments including piano and guitar and is also an engineer and producer. Currently, Grey is the only artist signed to a production deal with Alex da Kid and is in the studio with the super producer writing and recording her debut album for Wonderland Music/Interscope Records, for which she intends to release the lead-off single this spring. Until the release, Grey remains mum about what fans can anticipate: “You’ll have to wait and see,” is all she has for those seeking insight. “I write songs purely based on my emotions. Whether its commercial or not has never mattered to me.”","<p>Skylar Grey is a singer/songwriter whose recent breakout performance on the <span class=""caps"">GRAMMY</span> Awards alongside Dr. Dre and Eminem for their newest single, “I Need A Doctor,” has elevated her into the spotlight, beyond her writing credits, as a phenomenal, critically-acclaimed singer.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/james-cotton","James Cotton","Tunica, MS","","Over the course of his storied career, Cotton has seemingly done it all. As a small boy he learned harmonica directly from Sonny Boy Williamson. He toured with Howlin’ Wolf, recorded for Sun Records, and spent twelve years with Muddy Waters before stepping out on his own. Leading his own band, he rose to the very top of blues and rock scenes, touring the world non-stop and earning his reputation as one of the most powerful live blues performers in the world. Cotton is one of the few bluesmen to have the power to literally suck the reeds out of the harmonica from the pure force of his playing. He brings that power back to Alligator Records with his new CD, GIANT, a ferocious blast of brash boogie blues. Produced by Cotton, Jacklyn Hairston and Derek O’Brien and recorded by Stuart Sullivan at Wire Recording in Austin, Texas, GIANT features twelve tracks, including four new Cotton originals and co-writes, alongside songs made famous by Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Ivory Joe Hunter and others. Throughout his career, Cotton has always led great bands, and the players on GIANT are no exception. With guitarists/vocalists Slam Allen and Tom Holland, bassist Noel Neal and drummer Kenny Neal, Jr., GIANT is not just a reminder of Cotton’s legendary status, it is a vibrant, hard-hitting album made by one of the true blues masters. Born in Tunica, Mississippi on July 1, 1935, Cotton actually grew up on a cotton plantation. The youngest of eight brothers and sisters, he received a fifteen-cent harmonica for Christmas as a very small boy and mastered it almost immediately. He began listening to Sonny Boy Williamson’s “King Biscuit Time” broadcasting from Helena, Arkansas on KFFA, and learned to imitate the older bluesman note for note. In 1944, after both of Cotton’s parents had passed away, his uncle took the nine-year-old boy to Helena to meet his hero. The child’s talent amazed Sonny Boy, who took the boy under his wing, and Cotton spent many nights traveling with Williamson to juke joints all over the area. Too young to enter the clubs, the youngster often played for tips outside, sometimes drawing crowds to rival Sonny Boy’s. When Williamson left for Milwaukee in 1950, Cotton, now 15, took over Sonny Boy’s band. While this arrangement didn’t last beyond a few gigs, Cotton got his first taste of band leading. He then joined Howlin’ Wolf’s band, touring with him all over the South. Cotton learned all about the road from Wolf, and, though only a teenager, he was determined to make a name for himself. By 1952 he had moved to West Memphis, gigging often in local juke joints and clubs and, along with drummer Willie Nix, hosting a local radio show sponsored by Hart’s Bread (“No way for you not to know it ’cause the red heart is there to show it.”). In 1953, the teenage Cotton received word that Sun Records owner Sam Phillips wanted to record him. He cut a total of four sides for Sun in 1953-54, including the classic “Cotton Crop Blues.” In 1954, Muddy Waters came through Memphis without Junior Wells, his harp player at the time. Waters was well aware of Cotton’s rising reputation and asked the young harpslinger to join his band. Cotton headed to Chicago with Waters, staying by his side for over a decade, becoming Muddy’s trusted confidante and the leader of his backing band. The first few years Cotton was with Waters, Chess Records still insisted on having Little Walter record with Muddy. But that changed beginning in 1958, when Cotton joined Waters in the studio, recording on many of Muddy’s later classics sides, including “She’s 19 Years Old and Close To You.” Cotton convinced Waters to perform and record “Got My Mojo Working,” and can be heard playing on the definitive version of the song on Waters’ 1960 Chess LP, LIVE AT NEWPORT. By 1966, Cotton was ready to head out on his own. He first recorded album sides under his own name for the CHICAGO/THE BLUES/TODAY! series on Vanguard, and along with Otis Spann, cut “The Blues Never Die!” for Prestige. He made his first solo albums— three for Verve and one for Vanguard — in the late 1960s, with bands featuring outstanding musicians, including famed guitarist Luther Tucker and master drummers Sam Lay and Francis Clay. With his gale-force sound and fearless boogie band (later featuring Matt “Guitar” Murphy), it wasn’t long before he was adopted by the burgeoning hippie audience as one of their own. Cotton shared stages with Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, B.B. King, Santana, Steve Miller, Freddie King and many others. In 1969 he appeared on Hugh Hefner’s groundbreaking PLAYBOY AFTER DARK syndicated television program. Cotton was universally renowned as one of the hardest-touring and most popular blues artists of the 1970s. His acrobatic showmanship (he often did somersaults on stage) and full-throttle blues kept him in demand at concert halls all over the country. He played the Fillmore East in New York, the Fillmore West in San Francisco and every major rock and blues venue in between. During the decade, he cut an album for Capitol and three for Buddah. He rejoined his old boss Muddy Waters for the series of Muddy albums produced by Johnny Winter, starting with HARD AGAIN in 1977. Cotton also guested on recordings by Koko Taylor and many others. He was joined on his own albums by stars like Todd Rundgren, Steve Miller and Johnny Winter. Cotton joined Alligator Records in 1984, releasing HIGH COMPRESSION and LIVE FROM CHICAGO: MR. SUPERHARP HIMSELF!!! (which earned him the first of his four Grammy nominations). In 1990 he joined fellow Chicago harp masters for the all-star release HARP ATTACK!. He won a Grammy Award in 1996 for his Verve album, DEEP IN THE BLUES, was inducted into the Blues Hall Of Fame in 2006, and the Smithsonian Institution has honored Cotton by adding one of his harmonicas to their permanent collection. During the 2000s Cotton has continued recording and touring relentlessly, playing clubs, concert halls and festivals all over the world, electrifying audiences wherever he performs. Today, while turning over the singing duties to his road band, Cotton can still blow the reeds right out of a harp. GIANT reaffirms James Cotton’s high-compression blues harmonica playing is a true force of nature. As THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER says, “James Cotton is an inimitable blues legend. His wailing harmonica blows them away. His improvisations on the blues are full of fun and good humor. The blues don’t get much better.” In June 2010, Cotton was honored at New York’s Lincoln Center, where his friends Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins, Taj Mahal, Shemekia Copeland and others paid tribute in an all-star concert. There James Cotton played to yet another sold-out venue, with fans cheering the man known worldwide as “Mr. Superharp,” an undisputed giant of the blues.","<p>Over the course of his storied career, Cotton has seemingly done it all.

The blues don’t get much better.”</p> <p>In June 2010, Cotton was honored at New York’s Lincoln Center, where his friends Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins, Taj Mahal, Shemekia Copeland and others paid tribute in an all-star concert.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/dayna-kurtz","Dayna Kurtz","Brooklyn, NY","singer-songwriter, jazz, female vocalists","In April of last year, New Jersey native Dayna Kurtz escaped to the desert to write the songs for her fourth album. ""I completed most of the songs for Another Black Feather in a hermitage maintained by some lovely people for solitary religious introspection. I stayed in an adobe hut on 500 acres in the Sonoran desert in Arizona. There was no electricity, nobody around for miles, a cot, a table, chair and pitcher. 2 weeks. I brought no distractions – no novels, only books of writing exercises and poetry. It was so quiet at night I could hear the blood beat in my ears. It was sublime, and I wrote constantly. When I wasn’t writing I’d take a walk, stop and watch a bug climbing around a desert flower for an hour. I learned a lot about my friends when I described this trip to them, and showed them pictures. My artist/writer/musician friends were mostly envious. But some people looked at the hut and said, ‘Is that a dirt floor?’” Making the album came just as easily. “We recorded the basics live to tape, 2 or 3 takes per song, and picked the best of ‘em right then. I love analog. When you record digitally it just requires too much imagination to hear how good it might sound when you’ve overdubbed, mixed and mastered. When you record to tape, it sounds like a record right out of the gate. It helped us make decisions faster – we just knew when it was good or great or bad, not based on the perfection of performance, but based on overall vibe.” “It was the best of both worlds; the warmth and immediacy of analog with the final flexibility of pro-tools. I’m never recording any other way again.”Co-producing the album with Dayna was Randy Crafton, who has worked with Dayna on all 3 of her studio albums. Some of the musicians who helped Dayna bring her songs to life include her long-time back up band, bassist Dave Richards and keyboard/accordionist Peter Vitalone, the singer-songwriter Malcolm Holcombe, Matt Darriau and Frank London from the Klezmatics, Jorge Alfano (charango), Rob Curto (accordion), and Danny Bensi, Saunder Jurriaans and Gregory Rogove from the band Tarantula AD. ”Dave, Randy, Pete and I are turning into a really crack studio machine lately. Both Randy and Dave have started families in the last couple of years, so they really can’t get on the road with me all that often anymore. It’s made us really appreciate our time in the studio that much more. They’re family now, and we play like it. They know my quirks as a player so well that we barely have to discuss what’s going on, they’re just right there. I played a lot of lap steel for the first time on this record. It’s a completely different feel than regular old slide guitar – you have to keep it very simple, to the point, and it’s unforgiving on intonation. I keep on wanting to invent studio projects for us so I don’t have to wait till I’ve written an album full of songs to get back there with them. I want to find someone who wants us as a backing band, so I can just play lap steel guitar for hours with these guys. I wish we could be Booker T and the MG’s, and find our Bill Withers to produce and back up.""Following in the footsteps of the diverse Beautiful Yesterday, Another Black Feather finds Dayna leaning more heavily on her roots and country influences than usual, in particular making generous use of her new lap steel guitar, and showcasing her prodigious slide work on other songs. “One of the things that I seem to encounter constantly is that I don’t really quite fit anywhere,” observes Dayna Kurtz. Asked by a European journalist what her music was ‘made of’, Dayna replied, “If you’re at the flea market, you walk past all the fine old antiques and the cheap designer knockoff clothing from China, past the used German leather jackets, and over in the back is an old man with a battered tweed hat who has some blankets on the ground covered with old toasters and a pair of ladies knickers from the 50’s, a snow globe from the 1992 Olympic games, and a box of old men’s watches and broken reading glasses and teaspoons. I’ll be picking through there.”The lack of a ready stylistic tag hasn’t stopped the resourceful performer from building a substantial audience—and a compelling body of recorded work—on her own terms. She maintains an enthusiastic international fan base that’s embraced the poetic passion of her songwriting and the communicative power of her voice, an unforgettable, distinctly husky instrument that’s capable of immense depth and sensitivity. She has also inspired reams of rapturous acclaim from critics and won admiration from her musical peers.Dayna Kurtz began performing her original compositions in public as a teenager, and subsequently spent the better part of a decade touring solo across the back roads of America, selling CD’s out of her trunk and mesmerizing club and festival crowds with her riveting live performances. Along the way, she opened shows for the likes of Richie Havens (who became a fan and lent guest vocals to her debut studio album, Postcards from Downtown). The last few years has found Dayna winning over new fans in the New York City music scene. In the past two years she has been invited to open up for Rufus Wainwright, Antony & the Johnsons, and Keren Ann. Additionally, Dayna has won over fellow “Living Room” habitué Norah Jones, who sings a duet with Dayna on “I Got It Bad…” (From Beautiful Yesterday). Outside of her new hometown, the legendary Richard Thompson invited Dayna to open up for a coast-to-coast nationwide tour that found Dayna converting some of his faithful fans. The fan response and critical attention generated by Kurtz’s grass roots touring efforts inevitably drew interest from the mainstream music industry. Despite her indie status, Dayna has found an enthusiastic audience, winning high-profile guest spots on such radio shows as World Cafe, Mountain Stage and NPR’s Morning Edition. But nowhere has the interest in Dayna’s music been more pronounced than in Holland, where Dayna’s debut studio album soared into the top 20 of the album charts on the strength of the hit single “Love Gets in the Way”. In the summer of 2003, Dayna went from performing in front of 50 people at the Living Room in New York City’s lower east side, to headlining the fabled Paradiso theatre in Amsterdam in front of 1000 people in what would be her first of many sold out shows in the Netherlands in the months to follow. Dayna has since then discovered a larger audience in Europe, and this spring alone will find her in Greece, Spain, Germany, Belgium and the UK. But Dayna Kurtz has worked too hard to allow such adulation to go to her head. “Every step I’ve taken has felt really organic, and like they’ve been made at the right time,” she states, adding, “The records I’ve made feel like honest expressions of where I’m at musically, and the making of them has been joyful and interesting.”“Besides, every musician should feel like a rock star in at least one country.”","<p>In April of last year, New Jersey native Dayna Kurtz escaped to the desert to write the songs for her fourth album.

Possessing a commanding voice, a distinctive melodic sensibility and an uncanny knack for nailing complex emotions in song, Speace makes music that’s both illuminating and effortlessly accessible. From the rustic rush of ""Step Out of the Shade"" to the bittersweet lilt of ""Water Landing"" to the gentle acoustic intimacy of ""Two,"" Songs for Bright Street’s 12 original compositions (plus a slyly countrified reading of the Blondie classic ""Dreaming"") showcase Speace’s unique gifts, offering catchy Americana with indelible hooks, sharply observed lyrics and a gritty urban edge. Among those impressed by her sassy songcraft is legendary folk-pop songstress Judy Collins, who chose Songs for Bright Street to release on her new Wildflower label. Amy Speace has already won a loyal grass-roots fan base, thanks in large part to live performances that merge warmth, humor and emotional immediacy, and to a tireless touring schedule that’s already taken her across the United States. She’s also won considerable critical acclaim, with The Village Voice observing that Speace is ""taking her Americana away from twangy contemplation toward tangy confrontation"" and noting that she’s ""not another of those breathy would-be child poets, but a real singing writer of songs."" Time Out New York stated, ""Amy Speace plays sweet, twangy folk music with a clear voice and an innocent vulnerability,"" while The Nashville Scene noted that she ""balances wry humor with open-hearted honesty.""

Home is perhaps where you choose to land.","<p>On her new album Songs for Bright Street, New York-based singer/songwriter Amy Speace demonstrates why she’s quickly become one of her adopted hometown’s most celebrated emerging artists. Possessing a commanding voice, a distinctive melodic sensibility and an uncanny knack for nailing complex emotions in song, Speace makes music that’s both illuminating and effortlessly accessible. From the rustic rush of ""Step Out of the Shade"" to the bittersweet lilt of ""Water Landing"" to the gentle acoustic intimacy of ""Two,"" Songs for Bright Street’s 12 original compositions (plus a slyly countrified reading of the Blondie classic ""Dreaming"") showcase Speace’s unique gifts, offering catchy Americana with indelible hooks, sharply observed lyrics and a gritty urban edge. Among those impressed by her sassy songcraft is legendary folk-pop songstress Judy Collins, who chose Songs for Bright Street to release on her new Wildflower label. Amy Speace has already won a loyal grass-roots fan base, thanks in large part to live performances that merge warmth, humor and emotional immediacy, and to a tireless touring schedule that’s already taken her across the United States. She’s also won considerable critical acclaim, with The Village Voice observing that Speace is ""taking her Americana away from twangy contemplation toward tangy confrontation"" and noting that she’s ""not another of those breathy would-be child poets, but a real singing writer of songs."" Time Out New York stated, ""Amy Speace plays sweet, twangy folk music with a clear voice and an innocent vulnerability,"" while The Nashville Scene noted that she ""balances wry humor with open-hearted honesty."" And renowned Nashville critic Robert K. Oermann, writing in Music Row, dubbed her a ""new star."" <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Amy+Speace"" target=""_blank"">Listen at Last.fm</a><br />I was born in Baltimore at the tail end of the hippie-dippie-love-fest decade to two very solid, faith-based people who had nothing to do with love-ins and be-ins and were probably in church the weekend Woodstock swept the country.

In the three years since their last record (Talking to the River-produced by Los Lobos Steve Berlin), their mother, Gloria, died after a struggle with cancer. It was Gloria’s fight for life, not her loss, that made Lisa re-examine her own life. Beautiful Mistake finds her doing just that. Her writing on this album is her best to date. She confronted longtime friend and bassist, Michael “Cornbread”Traylor about his hidden talents and tapped them as producer. He put together a great cast of talented musicians and pulled out some of Morales’ best performances. Guest performers include Walt Wilkins and Dustin Welch. Lisa has also worn producers hat with highly acclaimed production on Hayes Carlls’ “Flowers & Liquor; co-wrote “Waiting For the Stars to Fall” with Hayes Carll on his last CD “Trouble In Mind”. She also co-wrote “Helpless Heart” on Clay Blakers’ “Welcome to the Wasteland” and sang “No More Memories Hangin’ ‘Round” duet with Clay Blaker on “Welcome to the Wasteland”.","<p>After building a strong reputation with sister Roberta as Sisters Morales, Lisa Morales steps out on her own with an album of self-penned songs that are more about emotion than they are about pretty.</p> <p>In the three years since their last record (Talking to the River-produced by Los Lobos Steve Berlin), their mother, Gloria, died after a struggle with cancer.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/dj-theory","DJ Theory","New York, NY","","At the age of 12, a young kid from Connecticut sat in his room with nothing but the album Paid In Full on repeat. The love he felt for the music led him down the path of working countless hours doing chores and odd jobs around the neighborhood for just enough money to buy one belt-drive Numark turn table. Practicing with his parents Motown vinyl records that had been lying around, his passion for Deejaying began to grow. At 13, Jon Wienner earned enough to purchase a second turntable and an old Vestax mixer that could barely cut from side to side. Weekend days would be spent venturing into Brooklyn and downtown Manhattan to dig through crates at A1, Fatbeats, and Rock & Soul records. Moving into high school, he jumped at any and every opportunity to spin at local parties and events in his community, including his work on 91.7 WBSL. The rush and joy he received from making people dance and move was overwhelmingly satisfying, fueling endless hours of diligent work to develop an original sound and craft. After finishing high school, he moved into New York City to attend Sarah Lawrence College. Keeping a promise to his parents, his focus remained on academics: but his heart was in Deejaying and music. After wrapping up freshman year, Jon began to spin at clubs beginning in March. Despite playing at impressive venues at such a young age, Jon became even more entranced on becoming the artist he passionately sought to be. Unfortunately, the massive task of a DJ succeeding as an artist in a world of dumb-down music and depleted nightlife became an apparent reality. One night at one of his residencies, Jon and his manager Jacob found themselves in a quarrel that had become a typical reoccurrence throughout his early career. The two up and comers spent the summer witnessing deceptive politics in nightlife and hollowed music scene perpetuated by many of the DJs in the industry. Arguing about how realities should be, the two came to a conclusion that it was time to terminate the trend. Their vision for how the world should be culminated into a philosophy represented through the entity of Theory. DJ Theory was born, embodying an ideology genuine talent and art that Jon takes on the task of living out each day. As a sophomore, Jon transferred to the prestigious Gallatin school at New York University; focusing on Deejaying, music production, and music history. Now as an up and coming DJ, Jon’s dream is steadily becoming a reality. At just 20 years old, he has been blessed to have spun at some of New York City’s biggest venues: 1Oak, GoldBar, The Rivington Hotel, Greenhouse, Tenjune, Hudson Terrace, and Butter- just to name a few. As one of the most talented young DJs in the country, DJ Theory combines innate ability with finely sharpened craft that is instantly tangible upon walking into a room. His dream is more than just becoming the best DJ on the planet. Theory’s dream is to transcend the boundaries of what a DJ can achieve while retaining a vision of what a true artist needs to be. Making theories into reality.","<p>At the age of 12, a young kid from Connecticut sat in his room with nothing but the album Paid In Full on repeat. The love he felt for the music led him down the path of working countless hours doing chores and odd jobs around the neighborhood for just enough money to buy one belt-drive Numark turn table. Practicing with his parents Motown vinyl records that had been lying around, his passion for Deejaying began to grow. At 13, Jon Wienner earned enough to purchase a second turntable and an old Vestax mixer that could barely cut from side to side. Weekend days would be spent venturing into Brooklyn and downtown Manhattan to dig through crates at A1, Fatbeats, and Rock & Soul records. Moving into high school, he jumped at any and every opportunity to spin at local parties and events in his community, including his work on 91.7 <span class=""caps"">WBSL</span>. The rush and joy he received from making people dance and move was overwhelmingly satisfying, fueling endless hours of diligent work to develop an original sound and craft. After finishing high school, he moved into New York City to attend Sarah Lawrence College. Keeping a promise to his parents, his focus remained on academics: but his heart was in Deejaying and music.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/platurn","Platurn","The O, California, US","","Minimalist / Emotronic / FunkMan, who the hell isn’t a DJ in the Bay Area these days? Every other person you bump into is on the tip. Just being a DJ isn’t good enough anymore. It has to be, “I’m an intelligent down tempo booty rock electro-clash mash-up glitch-IDM DJ. Oh, and I also play Duran Duran.”When was it decided that any clown with 10 records (or 1000 MP3s and Serato) is a DJ, and when was it decided that just being a good old-fashioned Hip-Hop DJ is passé?DJ Platurn is way beyond all of that. He’s a real deal hip-hop DJ who rocks the party the original way: nothing but top-notch track selection and skills to back it up. Give the man two turntables and a mixer and stand back because you’re going to witness some classic DJing. He’ll not only serve the crowd what they’re hungry for, he’ll keep ‘em dancing with all kinds of tunes they didn’t even know they wanted to hear. Cutting up breakbeats, doing blends live and on the fly, scratching, mixing …the guy’s got the full skill set to be a fully-rounded DJ, and he’s good at everything. Not only is that increasingly rare in today’s “instant DJ – just add water!” world, it’s a strong and important tie to the Hip-Hop tradition Platurn comes from: In order to get on and really do a good job as a DJ, you have to be well-rounded.Being a good and well-rounded DJ also means being a top-notch selector. Platurn ain’t fakin’ the funk when it comes to his record collection and what he plays for the crowd. Well-known cuts, obscurities, remixes, hip-hop, funk, rock, disco, soul, electro and pop all expertly woven together. You want B-boy breaks? He’s got you covered. Slow jams? Awwww yeeeeaaaah. Do you want Old-School hip-hop? Break out the Gazelles, fool! Wherever the party needs to go, he is prepared to take it there.Word certainly spreads quickly; besides having been voted Oakland’s best DJ by the East Bay Express and winning Scions’ Free Up Your Mix competition along with fellow Oakland Fader DJ Spair, Platurn has devastated crowds from coast to coast and internationally. In doing so, he’s shared the stage with folks like Z-Trip, Krs-One, Mixmaster Mike, The Beat Junkies, DJ Premier, Slick Rick, Maseo (De La Soul), ZionI, Jazzy Jay, Quest-Love(The Roots), M.F. Doom, A-Trak, Afrika Bambaata, Pete Rock, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and a whole bunch more.

His busy performance schedule includes dates with the same band that was featured on the CD entitled “Lately,” which you can get from iTunes, Amazon, CD Baby and many other music retailers for only $7. Like many performing artists, Andrew began writing his own songs at a young age. He bought a guitar and began learning how to play in 2000 after breaking his leg on a snow skiing trip with friends. The rest, as some say, is history- history which took him through fun years in high school with a hardcore metal band, where he learned more about the music business and about making great music with good friends. After parting ways with the band in his senior year of high school, Andrew once again took up the acoustic guitar—which had always been a greater love— in search of songs that would both entertain an audience and make new friends along the way. Andrew attended TCU in Fort Worth,TX where he met hundreds of people who were fans first but became even better friends over time. Through his experiences there, he continued to hone his songwriting skills while regularly performing at a nearby restaurant. In 2010, Andrew married the love of his life- his girlfriend of 3.5 years, and 2 months later had the opportunity to work with some incredible musicians and a fantastic engineer to produce the album entitled “Lately.” Available at all concerts and on iTunes, Amazon and many other retail outlets, the CD has drawn rave reviews from both fans and strangers, a sure sign that this story has not been finished yet.","<p>Andrew Sullivan is a singer-songwriter based out of Fort Worth, TX.

We want you to know that we consider you an integral part of what we’re doing because the dream we pursue involves you. The Anthemeers are not about creating music for anyone (no offense!), but instead we feel that music is something that helps to create all of us. “The greater the master, the more his person vanishes behind his work.” And this is truly our hope. We want to take part in a style of music that draws people together and allows us all to move where the music takes us. The members of the Anthemeers have been individually pursuing this idea for years but we were recently lucky enough to find like-minded musicians to help one other realize this dream. Thus the Anthemeers were formed. Our interest in participating in music communally has given us a chance to brush shoulders with a wide range of genres and consequently has allowed us to develop a great appreciation for world music. Because of this we have a somewhat eclectic sound but we still maintain our roots in the indie and folk genres. We’re currently based out of Huntsville Texas with seven members who each play multiple musical roles. The members are currently Jay Elms, Ryan Sausage, Daniel Gathright, Lauren Novak, Josh Jackson, Kevin Dixon, and Nathan Huff.","<p>Thank you for visiting our site and for participating with us in our dream.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/nappy-roots","Nappy Roots","","","Life, Liberty and The Pursuit of Nappyness: In an economically recessed climate, Nappy Roots has joined the rest of the nation in trying to understand and work through financial and emotional struggles. No stranger to challenges, this five-man collective from Kentucky tackled their obstacles and, in the process, their self-proclaimed best and most honest work emerged —The Pursuit of Nappyness. In this sixth studio album, Nappy Roots examine our alienable rights, reason, and truth through lyrical originality and voyage. Since Nappy Roots entered the music scene in 1998, they have remained real, humble, talented guys with inherent, undeniable southern swagger. After the international success of Watermelon, Chicken, & Grits, selling over 3 million albums, the members of Nappy Roots were flying high while still acutely aware of how far it could be to the bottom should they fall. It is that practical and genuine presence of mind that helped them sustain touring as a group these last ten years. Building a vastly loyal fan-base nationwide, fans and friends can be used interchangeably when referring to their army of followers. For most people, it is normal to only share intimate moments with friends, but for the members of Nappy, it is no different when in their living room, in the studio, or on stage as they possess the gift of honesty and deliver that message charismatically. That truthfulness is especially reflected in this compilation inspired and written for this moment in time. After dealing with their severed relationship with Atlantic Records, it was inevitable change was indeed about to come. This change came in the form of R. Prophet striking out on his own for his solo effort. Nappy Roots had no choice but to keep it moving and did so as smoothly as possible. As the saying goes, “the show must go on,” and so it has, obstacles included. With a heavy heart and no major label record deal, Nappy Roots knew they had to remain in pursuit of their destiny and, thus, Nappy Roots Entertainment Group was formed. The members of Nappy Roots were facing foreclosures and a mountain of stress in the jobless economy, but still they remained positive and pushed on while never forgetting where they came from and what they had accomplished. With fans constantly communicating with the members online and at shows, the guys realized they weren’t the only ones having trouble. A weak man with no vision, no diligence behind the vision, and no faith behind the diligence would have given up, but Skinny Deville, Fishscales, Big V, B. Stille and Ron Clutch did, can, and will handle this and more, all in The Pursuit of Nappyness. To truly grasp the meaning of this pursuit, look forward to 4:20:10; through singles like “Fishbowl,” “Ride,” and standout tracks such as “Back Home,” “The People,” and “Be Alright,” friends and foes alike will experience the growth of Nappy Roots, and regardless if you were directly affected or not, there is no doubt you can’t appreciate and agree with the message Nappy Roots so beautifully conveys. With the bonus track for fan appreciation entitled “All for You,” it is concretely revealed why Nappy Roots still is relevant and that there will be continued longevity for this group. So, sit back, relax, and grab your papers because Nappy Roots definitely give you something to think about while they take you on their journey to “The Pursuit of Nappyness.”","<p>Life, Liberty and The Pursuit of Nappyness: In an economically recessed climate, Nappy Roots has joined the rest of the nation in trying to understand and work through financial and emotional struggles. No stranger to challenges, this five-man collective from Kentucky tackled their obstacles and, in the process, their self-proclaimed best and most honest work emerged —The Pursuit of Nappyness. In this sixth studio album, Nappy Roots examine our alienable rights, reason, and truth through lyrical originality and voyage.</p> <p>Since Nappy Roots entered the music scene in 1998, they have remained real, humble, talented guys with inherent, undeniable southern swagger. After the international success of Watermelon, Chicken, & Grits, selling over 3 million albums, the members of Nappy Roots were flying high while still acutely aware of how far it could be to the bottom should they fall. It is that practical and genuine presence of mind that helped them sustain touring as a group these last ten years.

The band’s latest offering of bleeding heart defiance and optimism, The Better Angels of Our Nature, represents those attributes in both exhibition and execution. Rather than suffer the trappings of the record industry’s broken business model, the latest chapter in Glossary’s long legacy is available directly from the band completely free of charge. No strings attached, no cut corners, no hassle – just a band enthusiastic about what they’re doing. From the opening lilt of “Only Tell Will Tell” to the matter-of-fact declaration of “I’m still holding on to rock ‘n roll” on album closer “Blood On the Knobs,” there’s plenty on Better Angels about which to be excited. Having crashed the Glossary website the day of release due to the sheer volume of downloads, the band’s fifth full-length finds the septet ascending even higher above their simple Southern roots — exploring the beauty, nuance, conflict and contradictions of life in Dixie. The vitality found in these songs transcends whatever medium through which they might be presented, putting Glossary in a position of utmost importance during a cross-section in music’s history. The Better Angels of Our Nature will also be made available on CD on Oct 23, pressed in a series of short runs featuring artwork courtesy of local Middle Tennessee artists and designers, with a vinyl release to follow in early 2008. http://www.glossary.us/ Listen at Last.fmSome local bands build a buzz and a following until they get a crack at going national. Other local bands, like Murfreesboro, TN's Glossary, keep at it year after year because something needs to be expressed, even if no more than a few thousand people ever hear it. Those bands are the rock equivalent of regional filmmakers, turning out low-budget, heartfelt stories that zero in on lifestyles and locations that the mainstream media overlooks. Three years after knocking out the restless Southern-rock epic How We Handle Our Midnights, Glossary has scraped together enough money to make For What I Don't Become, with the help of Centro-Matic studio whiz Matt Pence. Like the previous album, the new one is full of loud, anthemic songs sparked with plenty of twang and chug. It's also another album about people who work hard and don't seem to get anywhere. For What I Don't Become's centerpiece song is ""Days Go By,"" a sprawling, scorching twang-rocker that makes the title phrase more haunting by adding the words ""even when we don't want 'em to."" For What I Don't Become weighs its rootsy kick against a strong note of loneliness on songs like ""Headstones And Dead Leaves"" and the molten ballad ""The Reckless,"" but the dominant tone of the album is set by the opening song ""Shaking Like A Flame,"" which rumbles like a locomotive even as Kneiser sings about how it feels to rust. This may be one of the most exultant albums ever made about failure.","<p>Ten years into their career, Murfreesboro, TN rock denizens Glossary have learned a few things.

The debut album will still be entitled “Phantom Limb.” WATER LIARS — “PHANTOM LIMB” — Misra Records Bio: Perhaps one of the greatest albums in Misra’s canon, Water Liars’ debut was entirely unplanned. Recorded on a whim, with one microphone, the then unnamed rock band – consisting of St. Louis, MO songwriter, vocalist, guitarist Justin Kinkel-Schuster and Oxford, MS drummer, producer, multi-instrumentalist Andrew Bryant – casually convened to play and record. Over the course of three days, in the small milltown of Pittsboro, MS, a series of ineffable and magical recordings came together. It was one of those seemingly providential experiences – far too remarkable to be denied. Water Liars was born. Paste, Pop Matters, Daytrotter, KEXP, and more have all hailed Justin Kinkel-Schuster during his tenure fronting independent rock act Theodore. Some time back, Misra planned to work with Theodore and, assuming the songs were mere outtakes under a different moniker, the Water Liars demos initially got pushed to the back burner. Kinkel-Schuster pleasantly persisted, however, insisting the project was vastly different and must be heard. Upon first listen, it was very clear that something truly remarkable really had occurred in the Phantom Limb sessions. Misra signed the band on the spot. Home to groundbreaking debuts by Shearwater, Great Lake Swimmers, and more, the label is excited to extend this tradition with Water Liars. After its sludgy intro, album opener “$100” blossoms into a weary, folk-pop gem. “Dog Eaten,” a gorgeous acoustic number highlighting Kinkel-Schuster’s inimitable voice – a trademark that earned him “Best Vocalist” via St. Louis main rag The Riverfront Times — immediately follows. Through its ten-song set, Phantom Limb continues on this unpredictable path – wavering from fast to slow, loud to quiet, but never once losing its magnetism. Songs like “Whoa Back,” “Rest,” and “Fresh Hell” captivate the listener until “On the Day” – a celestial, melancholic track about one’s deathday – closes the album and an inadvertent field recording is heard in the background. It’s a beautiful, fortuitous ending to Water Liars’ beautiful, fortuitous debut. Enjoy! Track list: 1. $100 2. Dog Eaten 3. Whoa Back 4. Rest 5. C.H.W 6. Short Hair 7. It Is Well With My Soul 8.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/gangsta-boo","Gangsta Boo","Memphis, TN","","Gangsta Boo was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. An anomaly within the generally misogynist late-‘90s Dirty South rap scene, Gangsta Boo won substantial acclaim among audiences without sacrificing her pride. As the sole female & an original member of Memphis, TN, hardcore rap group Three 6 Mafia, she had held her own; it wasn’t until her debut album, though, that she really started garnering an unprecedented amount of attention. Her first solo album, Enquiring Minds, was released in 1998 and reached number fifteen on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 46 on the Billboard 200. Enquiring Minds found Gangsta Boo confronting the lyrical issues that hardcore female rappers such as Lil’ Kim have to address: sexual politics, money hungry stereotypes, proving that a female can be hardcore, and so on. Enquiring Minds spawned the national anthem “Where Dem Dollas At!?” and helped to build the national stage for the Memphis music scene that was about to come. After the success of Enquiring Minds, she played a critical role in the multi-platinum success of Three 6 Mafia’s When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1 in 2000. She left the group following the release of their album When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1. Her 2001 album, Both Worlds *69, reached number eight on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart and number 29 on the Billboard 200. It featured the hit singles “Love Don’t Live (U Abandoned Me)” and “Can I Get Paid (Stripper’s Anthem).” Her third album, Enquiring Minds II: Soap Opera, released in 2003, peaked at number 53 on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart and 24 on the Top Independent Albums. The album spawned the street hit “Sippin & Spinnin’” and the remix with Bun B has turned into a staple in her music catalog. Boo released the album under her new record label “Crazy Lady Entertainment.” The album was also the first teaming of her and producer Drumma Boy whom have since created a musical bond. Gangsta Boo has also been collaborating with many artists in the rap industry over the past several years. She was featured on Lil Jon & The Eastside boy’s 2004 multi-platinum smash “Crunk Juice” on the underground hit “Da Blow.” She was featured on OutKast’s 2000album, “Stankonia.” Ludacris’ 2005 album “Disturbing The Peace.” Pastor Troy’s 2007 “Tool Muziq,” plus countless others that you can find on Google. She also teamed up with Nick Scarfo for the Prophet Posse reunion and been featured on their last three albums, “The Return, Pt. 1,” “The Return: Part 2 Belly of The Beast,” and “Hood U.S.A.” She also has released several mixtapes over the past few years including, “Street Ringers: Volumes 1 & 2,” “Still Gangsta: The Memphis Queen Is Back,” & “Gangsta Rock.” Gangsta Boo has just released a new digital single to iTunes and Amazon called “Miss.Com.” She also released the “Miss.Com” mixtape in December of 2010, and it is available for free download at Livemixtapes.com","<p>Gangsta Boo was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/orange-goblin","Orange Goblin","London, England","rock, metal, stoner rock, doom metal, stoner metal","Heavy Metal is not just about music: it’s a way of life, a motivating mind-set, a positive force and an inspirational belief system. It’s the most exciting, life-affirming noise that exists on this planet of ours, and London’s indestructible masters of the furious form are Orange Goblin. Not just the UK’s reigning champions of balls-out, party-starting, booze-fuelled metal, but one of the very best live rock bands of all time, the mighty Goblin have been a permanent and universally admired fixture on the British metal circuit for the past 16 years. And now they’re back, with ‘A Eulogy for the Damned’, their seventh and best studio album. A thunderous tour-de-force of gargantuan riffs, subterranean rumble and electrifying energy, it is the album the band have been threatening to make since they first crawled, with crumpled beer cans in hand, from the grubby Soho shadows back in the mid-90s. Inspired by the gods of hard rock, heavy metal, punk rock and underground extremity, from Sabbath, Motörhead and Thin Lizzy through to Celtic Frost, Danzig and Black Flag, Orange Goblin were initially seen as major contenders amid the mid-90s stoner rock explosion, but it soon became apparent that this band had much more up their collective wizard’s sleeve than red-eyed boogie and flapping flares. In fact, over the course of their roller coaster career, the band have proved themselves to be one of the most consistent and persistent forces in modern heavy music, amassing a catalogue of albums that rivals anything released during the same period. From the rambunctious, heads-down exuberance of their Frequencies From Planet Ten debut in 1997 through to the multi-genre bonfire of insanities that was 2007’s Healing Through Fire, Orange Goblin have always kicked arse, always written songs that hit home like a stage diver’s boot connecting with your forehead, always delivered the rampaging heavy metal goods while meaning every last riff, beat, solo and bellow. But it is as a live band that Orange Goblin have founded their formidable reputation. Long renowned as skilled crowd-pleasers and party masters, the band have toured all over the world and shared stages with countless big names, including Alice Cooper, Black Sabbath, Sex Pistols, Down, Queens Of The Stone Age, Dio, Monster Magnet and many more. They have headlined sell-out shows at New York’s revered CBGB’s, Los Angeles’ notorious Troubadour and the legendary Underworld in Camden, London. They have also blown fields full of minds at such prestigious festivals as Sonisphere, Download, Hellfest, Bloodstock Open Air, Roadburn, Dynamo, Maryland Death Fest and High Voltage. An Orange Goblin show is a guaranteed good time…all you need to do is get the beers in, prepare your neck muscles for maximum punishment and surrender to the sound of a grand heavy metal institution letting rip at full throttle. A lean, mean hard rocking’ machine…the eight-legged tag team of frontman Ben Ward, bassist Martyn Millard, guitarist Joe Hoare and drummer Chris Turner have reached a new peak of creativity and one-two-fuck-you intensity on ‘A Eulogy For The Damned’. This is the album that deftly encapsulates everything that is exhilarating and admirable about this most dedicated and humble of British metal wrecking crews and that deserves to propel Orange Goblin to the front of the British metal queue. They’re back and the party is starting all over again. Whose round is it?? “It has to be said that Orange Goblin shows are very predictable….you know they are going to be brilliant before they even hit the stage!” – Terry Bezer (Kerrang!) “Consistently one of the greatest live bands the UK has produced in recent decades!” – Dom Lawson (Metal Hammer) “Put simply, Orange Goblin are the best metal band in Britain!” – Malcolm Dome (Classic Rock) Official Website: www.orange-goblin.com Official Facebook: www.facebook.com/orangegoblinofficial Official Twitter: www.twitter.com/orangegoblin1 Official MySpace: www.myspace.com/theorangegoblin Official Youtube Channel: www.youtube.com/orangegoblinofficial UK / Europe Label: www.candlelightrecords.co.uk US / ROW Label: www.candlelightrecordsusa.com Management: www.onefifteen.com UK Booking: ben@onefifteen.com US Booking: erik@tonedeaftouring.com European Booking: klaus@vibra-agency.de Press: UK – Darren Toms – d.toms@plastichead.com US – Paula Hogan – paula@candlelightrecordsusa.com","<p>Heavy Metal is not just about music: it’s a way of life, a motivating mind-set, a positive force and an inspirational belief system.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/ancient-vvisdom","Ancient VVisdom","Austin Texas","","A dark, enlightening foresight into the future of humankind dictated by singer/songwriter Nathan Opposition. Ancient VVisdom was founded in Austin, TX in late 2009 with the order consisting of Nathan Opposition (ex-integrity drummer 2005-2010), Justin “Ribs” Mason (iron age bassist) on second acoustic guitar, and Nathan’s brother, Michael Jochum (ex-integrity guitarist 2003-2010) on electric guitar. In 2010, they recorded and released a split 12″ EP with Charles Manson entitled “Inner Earth Inferno” (Withdrawal Records), which garnished praise from critics and cultists alike. The band spent the rest of the year sharpening their blackened craft, using acoustic guitars to give the music an organic connection to the nefarious rites they beget. Writing well over an albums-worth of material, they chose the most appropriate songs for their debut LP ” a godlike inferno” to record at The Bubble, a local, vvorld renowned studio in Austin, TX. For the recording , they enlisted additional instrumentation by Alex Hughes (Hatred Surge, Iron Age) to play the bowed stand-up bass, Wade Allison (Iron Age) machete percussion and guest guitar lead on “lost civilization”, Chase VVarlow on bamboo percussion and Jason Buntz (engineer and co-producer) on select guitar and synth. Not unlike early death rock and neo-folkore sound, Ancient VVisdom incorporates electric guitar effects, synth sounds, vocal harmonies and abstract percussion to create a deeper, ethereal quality to their minimalist arranagements. Nathan’s powerfully honest voice is complimented by lyrics ranging from mysteries of the occult, paganism, satanic philosophy, and forbidden knowledge. In spring 2011 “A Godlike Inferno” will be released, as if commanded by the dark one himself.","<p>A dark, enlightening foresight into the future of humankind dictated by singer/songwriter Nathan Opposition.</p> <p>Ancient VVisdom was founded in Austin, TX in late 2009 with the order consisting of Nathan Opposition (ex-integrity drummer 2005-2010), Justin “Ribs” Mason (iron age bassist) on second acoustic guitar, and Nathan’s brother, Michael Jochum (ex-integrity guitarist 2003-2010) on electric guitar.

My Darling Clementine evokes the great duets of such icons as Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton, George Jones & Tammy Wynette but adds a touch of country soul to the mix bringing memories of the likes of Delaney and Bonnie, Donnie Fritts, Bobby Gentry and Dan Penn. Lou Dalgeish – BIOG. / 2010 - Leaves school aged 16 as a classically trained dancer and musician, and spends the next 12 months dancing in a circus in Mexico, - Returns to the UK and spends the next 10 years as a professional dancer in British theatre, television and film (including a performance in Spielberg’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). - Music is becoming a bigger passion than dance; throughout this time she continues to develop her own song writing and piano playing. - Decides to forego her dancing career and turns professional as a musician in the early 90’s - Within 12 months she is selling out Birmingham’s (her home town) Ronnie Scott’s club, and records her debut album, featuring a guest appearance from Brian Kennedy - The following year she plays the SXSW festival in Texas sharing the bill with Vic Chesnut, Victoria Williams and Ani DiFranco. - She tours Europe with Bryan Ferry, and Holland with Sophie B Hawkins - 1998 – 2001: Three albums follow, as do more tours with the likes of David Gray, Mica Paris, Heather Nova, Mary Coughlin, The Christians - 2001: She turns her attention to the work of her main influence, Elvis Costello, writing and appearing in the play They Call Her Natasha, a story of obsession and infatuation, based around a series of Elvis Costello songs, first performed at the Edinburgh Festival. - 2002 -2003: Lou amazes audiences throughout the U.K. and Ireland with her own stunning interpretations of Costello’s material,.

Michael Weston King is widely acknowledged as one of Britain’s finest singer songwriters, Admired by the likes of Chris Hillman, Ron Sexsmith, Jackie Leven, and the legendary Townes van Zandt (who recorded one of his songs), he draws his influence from a wide range of styles, from Pop to Folk, from Country to Soul, from Gospel to Blues He is the former leader of U.K. Alt Country pioneers The Good Sons, with whom he made 4 critically acclaimed albums in a seven year career, which was celebrated by the double album, Cosmic Fireworks-The Best of The Good Sons (1994-2001). MOJO magazine wrote “The band who must rate as England’s very own Uncle Tupelo. A truly thrilling collection.”, while www.americana-uk.com said “The British band that played alt. country before anyone knew what the hell it was. Had the Good Sons done this same thing across the Atlantic, they would surely have been acclaimed trailblazers.” For the past ten years he has been a solo troubadour, touring all over the world, performing with the likes of Nick Cave, John Cale, Roger McGuinn, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, America, Chris Hillman, Nils Lofgren, Ron Sexsmith, Arlo Guthrie, Steve Forbert, Son Volt, and many more, and releasing 6 studio albums, 3 live albums and a career retrospective dvd, The Crowning Story, along the way. As fine a singer songwriter as Gram Parsons CHRIS HILLMAN Michael Weston King has a voice part Nashville balladeer and part Alt Country hero………a cross between Nick Cave and Rodney Crowell. THE INDEPENDENT Like Tim Hardin, Phil Ochs or Townes van Zandt, King transmutes squalor and self-laceration into pure gold.

Beautiful Lies, a songbook of his work, was published in 2005, Happy Infidels, a play by the Irish writer Brian Richmond, was based around 12 of Michael’s songs, and he is currently working on a book about some of the greatest ‘lost’ songs of the past 40 years. A solo retrospective collection, The Tender Place, was released in November 2006, while his 2007 studio album, A New Kind of Loneliness including contributions from Chris Hillman, Ron Sexsmith and Jackie Leven, was met with high critical acclaim, and was widely hailed as his best album to date; A powerful work of unblinking emotional seriousness. Entombed in gorgeously sepulchral tunes, the effect is quite magnificent. King is a special talent. The Word MWK has entered the rarefied field of classic singer songwriters. USA Entertainment News His 2008 live album, Crawling Through The USA, recording during a grueling tour of N America, perfectly showcased the man alone, with just his guitar and songs for company. The album features Michael’s stunning interpretation of the Townes Van Zandt song, Marie.

America and, in May 2011, his first ever concerts in China. I Didn’t Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier wields a potent eternal truth.

Along the way he learned enough about life to know that he wanted to live it instead of squandering it and enough about love to walk away when it was wrong and recognize when it’s right, even if it came in some unusual packages (""Jemima James""). This is country music with a rock and roll heart. When Lee sings about his past you can hear a tinge of, not exactly regret, or even shame, but hard-earned wisdom. A masterful songwriter, Lee’s work reflects impressions made on him by everyone from Jerry Lee Lewis and Howlin’ Wolf to Arthur Alexander and the mersey beat sound of the british invasion of the 1960’s.

The music industry was shifting, their lives were headed in separate directions, the future of the band was in question. The band was at a crossroads: call it quits after nine years of making music together or do something drastic. The answer was a retreat to a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains. A place where they could create without distractions or limitations. A place where they promised they wouldn’t leave until they had a new album ready to be recorded. With the help of an avid, loyal fanbase, Kickstarter, and producer Jim Vollentine, they raised the funds necessary to record and release their newest album, Bury a Dream. The 11 new songs on the record replicate the high-energy and soaring, melodic hooks of past releases, but also reflect a bold evolution in the band’s songwriting capabilities. The title at first reading may appear ominous, predicting the end of something great. Yet it merely hides the full lyric, “Bury a dream, watch it grow,” declaring that dreams can die, but sometimes they must pass away in order to grow into something entirely new and beautiful. Driver Friendly is a band reborn with a new found sense of urgency to get their music to as many ears as possible.

Born in Nigeria and raised in Republic of Benin , Kalu fluently speaks three languages – French, English and Igbo (native language ).

Adam Darlin plays the drums, Will Schulz plays bass and sings vocal harmonies, and Brian Hobart plays keyboards and sings vocal harmonies as well. Our music is a hybrid of folk-rock, “prog- rock” and funk, with a strong emphasis on three part vocal harmonies. We have made a lot of studio recordings, but people seem to really fall in love with this band after seeing us perform live. We met each other while attending weekly jam sessions at a club in Athens, Ohio (home to Ohio University). These sessions were really amazing: we would get on stage and just start improvising with whoever was around…50% of the music would be somewhat questionable, but the other 50% was pure heaven. I felt a very strong musical communication happening between me, Brian, Will and Adam, and I was overjoyed when they agreed to start playing my original songs. Although about 75% of our set is composed, the other 25% is improvised, which keeps the spirit and excitement of these early jam sessions well intact. We developed an intensely beautiful audience in Athens, but longed to live and work in a major city instead of a college town. So, in the fall of 2008 we moved to Los Angeles, California. There are many times that we all miss the familiarity and friends we have back in the midwest, but we are meeting a lot of great musicians, contacts and new friends here in So-Cal, and we have been forced to raise our game just to fit in. We are currently working on a new studio album, and we are gigging all over Los Angeles and Orange County. We hope you enjoy our music, we hope you get something useful out of it, and we consider it a great privilege to continue to make it for you.","<p>Hello!

THEY BROKE UP. THEY WROTE SONGS. at a time when for most it would be the end of a relationship, for The Falls this feels like just the beginning… Almost subconsciously The Falls have documented their whole relationship in their songs. The love, the betrayal, the heartbreak. While at times it is hard for them to wear their hearts so openly on their sleeve, for The Falls, it has been a huge part of their songwriting. As Stevie Nicks said “devastation leads to writing good things”. In the fallout from Valentines Day, The Falls decided that rather than wallowing in self-pity they would put their heartbreak to tape. So they pulled out their little tascam 4-track portastudio, which, with all its tape wobbles and noise, aptly captured the fragility of their hearts. These fledgling recordings were just the beginning of what has become their debut EP ‘HOLLYWOOD’ (out now through MGM Distribution). In late 2011, The Falls hit the studio with producer Tony Buchen (Old Man River, Andy Bull, WIM, Washington) to record ‘Hollywood’. The Hotel Hollywood in Sydney, has featured so strongly in their lives that it was inevitable that it would manifest itself in this way. For most of 2010 and 2011, it was where they could be found playing each week at a little, somewhat undiscovered, night of free music that emerged from the back streets of Surry Hills called Folk Club. It is also where they met, where they found their sound and where they wrote these songs. In this intimate setting, the connection between these two onstage was palpable. Their emotionally fueled live performances are compelling to watch, sometimes heartbreakingly so, garnering reviews such as “intoxicating melodies and gorgeous harmonies” and “(their) strength lies in their ability to convey raw emotion and wisdom in their lyrics”. Buchen managed to imprint some of this Hollywood magic on each track, recording the re-verbs for the EP down in the bowels of the hotel, in the downstairs men’s toilets. So, each song has on it a little Hollywood porcelain re-verb or ‘pee-verb’ as they’ve been calling it. Having toured nationally this year with Of Monsters And Men (Iceland), Passenger (UK) and Avalanche City (NZ), The Falls are fast developing a very impressive live resume which also includes performances at the Surry Hills Festival, Peat’s Ridge Art and Music Festival, Gulgong Folk Festival and Nunnup Music Festival, as well as shows with Lior, Husky and Georgia Fair. The Falls have also showcased at APRA’s Song Summit 2012, BIGSOUND 2012 in Brisbane and have recently been invited to showcase at Canadian Music Fest in 2013 and are excited to be heading to Canada and the USA next year. Having also shared the stage with one of their idles Graham Nash, when he was in Australia on tour with Crosby, Stills & Nash, The Falls have had an incredible year. With an unmistakable sound, barefoot collaborators and best friends The Falls are gently making a name for themselves in 2012 “Beautiful harmonies, sweet as lyrics, warmth all round. I really love this. Those voices climb and soar so sweetly, and that toy piano comes in at just the right moment. A+.” - Zan Rowe, triple j (5/5) “the voices sit next to each other like they’ve been pouring from the same pot of tea for years and some judiciously deployed extras like strings and tuned percussion alongside the voices and the Falls – the duo of Simon Rudston-Brown and Melinda Kirwin –could earn a place on the same stage as the Civil Wars.” - Bernard Zuel, The Sydney Morning Herald “The debut EP Hollywood, is a cracker of a folk collection, a six-track taste of what these kids are capable of – it will certainly leave you wanting more.” - Rip It Up (4 ½ stars) http://triplejunearthed.com/THEFALLS http://musicfromthefalls.com/ http://www.youtube.com/user/videofromthefalls","<p><span class=""caps"">THE</span> <span class=""caps"">FALLS</span>.</p> <p><span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">MET</span>. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">FELL</span> IN <span class=""caps"">LOVE</span>. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">WROTE</span> <span class=""caps"">SONGS</span>.<br /> <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">FOUGHT</span>. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">MADE</span> UP. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">BROKE</span> UP. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">WROTE</span> <span class=""caps"">SONGS</span>.</p> <p>at a time when for most it would be the end of a relationship, for The Falls this feels like just the beginning…</p> <p>Almost subconsciously The Falls have documented their whole relationship in their songs.

The addition of Andrew on drums proved extremely beneficial to the group’s music, giving them a rock based genre and a much more energetic live set-up.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/canyons","Canyons","","","Canyons’ musical ensemble is hard to define. A theory of opposites attracting, a burgeoning front of beautiful contradictions. Their inspiration exists somewhere between sand dunes and icebergs, volcanoes and valleys, fiction and fact. Musically, Canyons never claim genres and more importantly, they don’t adhere to stereotypes. Striking the elusive balance between creativity, originality and pop sensibility, with an aural likeness to elements of psych, folk, house and everything deep, what is essential to Canyons is that their music evokes a sense of feeling and truth. Canyons’ story is one of intrigue and mystery, one that can be traced back to the Nether Valley in the outer regions of the Western Australian landscape. Ryan Grieve and Leo Thomson began making music separately, under various guises, before coming together as Canyons. ‘Hole in the Sky’, the record label the two founded together, was their initial musical point of contact and the coming together of their creative minds. The label’s first release garnered two pieces of music individually crafted by Leo and Ryan, but it wasn’t until the label’s second release; ‘the Lovemore EP’, that their combined sound manifested, and the name Canyons was born. Interestingly release number three was the debut EP from a little known Perth band named Tame Impala. The two went on to remix the likes of Ladyhawke, the Juan Maclean, !!! and of course, Tame Impala, causing a stir at home which was loudly echoed across the pond in the US and Europe. So much so that the band went on to release “Blue Snakes” on esteemed Parisian Label ‘I’m a Cliché’, closely followed by their deep, jamming epic, “Fire Eyes” on the coveted DFA Records. Not a band to rest on their laurels, Canyons then signed with Australian label Modular and began recording their debut album in the zoo-like, sound ranch they call home in inner-city Sydney. Taking a musical approach guided by intuition and feel, Canyons have forged their own identity amongst a sea of comers, goers and imitators. They traverse the obvious comparisons to whatever is on the radio right now, focusing on creating original music that could be from the past, present or future. Canyons unleash the first taste from their debut album in the form of ‘My Rescue’. The track is an ode to the sun, enlightenment. It is positivity and musical freedom at its very best. Close your eyes, feel the sun on your face, dance inside and out… Prepare yourselves for the sonic vision that is Canyons.","<p>Canyons’ musical ensemble is hard to define.

It earned a binder of superlative reviews from sources like NPR, The Seattle Times, and AM New York. To tour the album, she assembled a small cast of talented instrumentalists to re-interpret the disc for a dynamic live concert. Part rap show and part cabaret, the elegant presentation charmed both audiences and critics—not a negligible feat in hip hop, a genre with its share of purists. Castor, The Twin captures these new arrangements for ten of Dessa’s strongest previously released songs. It also includes “The Beekeeper,” the haunting advance single from Dessa’s new album due in 2012. Vibraphone, piano, viola, and stand-up bass give the record a classical, sometimes orchestral sound for a beautiful and somber effect. The album is immediately identifiable as an intimate recording of live players, with fingers sliding on frets and raw, expressive vocals. The organic instrumentation pushes Dessa’s lyrics forward, showcasing the imagery and narratives that define her as a songwriter and an emcee. The album title references the twin brothers Castor and Pollux of Roman mythology, the pair of bright stars in the Gemini constellation. Pollux was part god, a fighter with metal hands. Castor was the mortal of the pair, but the two were inseparable. After cutting her teeth with her Doomtree cohorts behind the boards, this is Dessa’s first record with a wholly organic sound—more tender, human versions of the best material she’s released so far. “Enchanting.” –Chicago Tribune “Dessa has emerged as one of the most diverse and talented artists in indie rap.” –URB “A one-woman powerhouse…with a literary sensibility and an aversion to genre clichés” –Utne Reader “If wordsmith-songbird Dessa isn’t the future of hip-hop, she should be.” -Insight News “Profound and moving” -Star Tribune “equal parts Ani Difranco and Mos Def” -Rift Magazine “Dessa combines the dry wit of Dorothy Parker with the beat of Mos Def” -Minnesota Public Radio “clear-eyed candor…understated realism and dark wit.” -Culturebully.com “witty, sardonic, and keenly observant of human behavior.” -TheDecider.com","<p>Dessa’s first full-length record, A Badly Broken Code, introduced her to a national audience as a rapper, a singer, and a potent, imaginative lyricist.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-black-atlantic","The Black Atlantic","Utrecht, NETH","indie, singer-songwriter, acoustic, dutch","The Black Atlantic is the Groningen (The Netherlands) based acoustic pop band formed around singer and songwriter Geert van der Velde, former frontman for American metalcore group Shai Hulud. The Black Atlantic released their debut album “Reverence for Fallen Trees” digitally for free (worldwide) as part of the In A Cabin With international recording series on August 21st, 2009. It has already been downloaded over 50.000 times since then… About “Reverence for Fallen Trees” In February, 2008, The Black Atlantic contacted the international recording project “In a Cabin With” (IACW) about a possible recording session. IACW were immediately enthusiastic and plans for a late 2008 recording, to take place in a log cabin, were made. The cabin, owned by van der Velde’s in-laws is located in the small town of Saranac Lake, in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York. For this recording, drummer Marcel Wolthof was re-enlisted alongside singer-songwriter Kim Janssen on various instruments. Janssen co-wrote some of the songs for the recording and has permanently settled in and joined the band. The title of the album “Reverence for Fallen Trees” is a metaphor for “honour the dead”, referring to van der Velde’s grandparents, 3 of whom passed away recently in the past year. The album deals with such topics as ‘remembrance’ , ‘grief’, ‘family’, ‘love’, ‘disenchantment’ and ‘overcoming’, eloquently worded and brought to life in natural methaphors and direct references to this period in his family history. Musically the new songs showcase a much wider variety of instrumentation and willingness to experiment with sounds and soundscapes, and the use of multi-layered vocal harmonies; inspired by such acts as Bon Iver, Fleet Foxes and the Beach Boys. Rhytmically the group has chosen for a much more minimal, percussive approach touring with only a snare drum, floor tom and cymbal. History & Touring: The Black Atlantic started as a project of van der Velde in his off time from his philosophy studies. Gradually the project turned more serious after van der Velde recorded his first song – a Valentine’s gift to his then girlfriend, now wife (and bandmember) – in February of 2006. After posting the song online (Myspace) and getting 2 immediate indie label deal offers, van der Velde wrote and recorded ‘Send This Home’ in the early Fall of 2006 with the help of various contributing friends and eventually abandoned his studies to focus full-time on the band. The EP documents van der Velde’s very first attempts at writing pop music, and showcases his penchant for melancholy and introspection, as well as his then obsession with Elbow. The EP was released on July 10th in the US by Five Point Records from New York (one of the two indie labels who had initially offered a deal). And, in January 2008, ‘Send This Home’ EP was re-released in Europe through Midsummer Records (DE). Live The Black Atlantic made it’s first live appearance, in one of many incarnations, at Eurosonic 2007. Since then the band has maintained a steady diet of touring, playing shows ,in a revolving line-up up, until April 2009, opening for Nada Surf (usa), Patrick Watson (ca) and touring the US East Coast and Midwest multiple times, once with Tim Williams (usa) and later with friends The Antlers (usa). In Europe the band has toured with Saturday Looks Good to Me (usa) and most recently with Windmill (uk). Listen at Last.fm","<p>The Black Atlantic is the Groningen (The Netherlands) based acoustic pop band formed around singer and songwriter Geert van der Velde, former frontman for American metalcore group <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Shai+Hulud"">Shai Hulud</a>. The Black Atlantic released their debut album “Reverence for Fallen Trees” digitally for free (worldwide) as part of the In A Cabin With international recording series on August 21st, 2009. It has already been downloaded over 50.000 times since then… About “Reverence for Fallen Trees” In February, 2008, The Black Atlantic contacted the international recording project “In a Cabin With” (<span class=""caps"">IACW</span>) about a possible recording session. <span class=""caps"">IACW</span> were immediately enthusiastic and plans for a late 2008 recording, to take place in a log cabin, were made. The cabin, owned by van der Velde’s in-laws is located in the small town of Saranac Lake, in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York. For this recording, drummer Marcel Wolthof was re-enlisted alongside singer-songwriter <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kim+Janssen"">Kim Janssen</a> on various instruments. Janssen co-wrote some of the songs for the recording and has permanently settled in and joined the band. The title of the album “Reverence for Fallen Trees” is a metaphor for “honour the dead”, referring to van der Velde’s grandparents, 3 of whom passed away recently in the past year. The album deals with such topics as ‘remembrance’ , ‘grief’, ‘family’, ‘love’, ‘disenchantment’ and ‘overcoming’, eloquently worded and brought to life in natural methaphors and direct references to this period in his family history. Musically the new songs showcase a much wider variety of instrumentation and willingness to experiment with sounds and soundscapes, and the use of multi-layered vocal harmonies; inspired by such acts as <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Bon+Iver"">Bon Iver</a>, <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Fleet+Foxes"">Fleet Foxes</a> and the <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Beach+Boys"">Beach Boys</a>.

Formed in 2002 as a solo IDM/noise project of singer John Gable, Knifight has slowly evolved into a fleshed-out quartet of four distinct songwriters, producers and instrumentalists. Referencing the melodic tendencies and dancy electronics of Xiu Xiu, New Order and LCD Soundsystem along with the kind of guitar and bass bombast that brought post-punk to arenas, the members of Knifight have created music that is both introspective and widely accessible. Known for their intensely energetic live performances, Knifight has had the opportunity to play official showcases at both SXSW 2011 and SXSW 2012 in addition to being asked to open for the likes of Future Islands, Active Child, Com Truise, White Denim and The Octopus Project among others. The band has also received much love from Austin’s own KUT and KOOP radio stations, including an hour-long exclusive spot as well as several interviews and guest DJ opportunities. On May 18, 2012 the band released the IN THE FIRE EP, a preview of their anticipated debut full-length record due out 2013 which will be the follow-up to two other highly regarded self-produced EP’s: 2011’s The End Is Knifight and 2009’s Now We’re Invisible.

The EP was recorded under their own supervision, not even utilizing studio space, making it more of a home-brew project. The production duo made up of Alaine Dickman and Taylor Nelson, decided to not only put a new level of detail into their vision, but to flourish in musical partnership releasing their debut full-length album entitled This Came First. (This Came First available for free download on 10/23/2012)Wiping out Thousands wanted to narrow in on their production and song craft with a more focused, straight forward collection of songs, with higher level of detail and thought. And thats exactly what the Minneapolis/St. Paul electroclash duo did on This Came First. Both Dickman and Nelson go on to say, “We worked a lot closer in putting songs together on this new album. We combed it over to make sure its what we want out there.”Previous releases were a big test for the duo in seeing how they could work together and what they could create. This Came First is definitely a more precise execution of their creativity. Dickman and Nelson worked along with engineer Adam Tucker of Signaturetone Recording on initial production of the album, while the duo handled all electronic production themselves.Wiping out Thousands chose the track “Feed” to be the first released single, giving listeners a taste of This Came First. The single will comfortably please your palate by highlighting Dickman’s voice, making all aspects of her vocals front and center for the first time. This track was an instant pick to use as the single because it ties in all themes on the album, bringing together danceable beats with aggressive instrumentation. “Feed” blends the songs and their textures that were chased during the making of the album. (Feed available for free download on 09/24/2012)This Came First will be self-released by Wiping out Thousands on 10/23/2012, and will be available for FREE digital download via the artists main website and Bandcamp page. The duo states, “We believe in giving our music away for free. It’s not a product, it’s our art. And we don’t like the idea of putting up a pay wall between us and any potential new listeners. Reaction Machine was free, and the new album will be available for free as well.” The debut, 8 song album, will also be available on ITunes, Amazon, and streaming on Spotify.

Lizzo has a popular project called Lizzo and The Larva Ink, Sophia Eris has released a steady stream of material (and expects a new record shortly) and Claire De Lune — also releasing an album at the end of June — has appeared as a guest vocalist on tracks by MaLLy, Guante and The Tribe & Big Cats! It should then come as no surprise that when the three team up as The Chalice, they are creating some of most dynamic music in Minnesota, fusing individual influences like soul, funk, R&B, reggae and straight up hip-hop. All transplants to the Midwest, you can hear what each woman brings to the mix. Claire De Lune harnesses the sultry, jazz-inspired nighttime of New York City. Sophia Eris hails from Dayton, OH, or the “Gem City” as it has been deemed, and she certainly exudes the queen-like qualities that exist inside all women, much like a younger Erykah Badu. And Lizzo lashes out with her fresh, southern bite, a result of growing up in Houston. The Chalice are still relatively new, but things seem bright — the response to their one public song “Push It” has been overwhelming. It’s a set-up that Minnesota hasn’t seen in a very long time: three respected female hip-hop artists under one roof, harnessing the girl-power that Aby Wolf, Dessa, Maria Isa and Desdamona have created in recent years. It’s time for the young ones to take over the reigns. With heavy support from the Rhymesayers roster, well-regarded South Minneapolis rappers and other musicians throughout the country, we think The Chalice will have no issue getting the attention that is warranted. —Jon Schober 89.3 The Current","<p>The three emcees in The Chalice are known quite well individually in the Twin Cities music community.

After relocating to Cincinnati, OH at the age of 10, DJ Funeral Fresh became consumed by late 90’s era rap. Inspired by East Coast veterans and Southern rap legends, Fresh’s love of hip-hop culture inspired him to spend his adolescents writing rhymes in an attempt to become a MC, but as fate would have it, he found his niche behind a pair of turntables and a mixer. After years of practicing in the privacy of his bedroom DJ Funeral Fresh made his debut as DJ Skinny Fresh and quickly became one of southern Ohio’s most sought after DJs. The time he spent mastering the art of spinning proved valuable, allowing him to rock shows alongside artists across the Hip-Hop spectrum – from Rick Ross, DJ Drama, Young Jeezy and Gucci Mane, to Nicki Minaj, Method Man and Redman, Jadakiss, Bow Wow, and Soulja Boy. Over the last 6 years, DJ Funeral Fresh has made an indelible mark in his pursuit of DJ greatness by being an Atlantic Records College DJ, Ohio Hip Hop Awards “Best Club DJ” nominee for four years consecutively and working with premium brands like Nike, Ciroc Vodka and McDonald’s. DJ Funeral Fresh’s strong fan base and connection to street culture represent his eclectic music taste and have generated local and national press, most-notably Ozone Magazine, MTV and Complex. DJ Funeral Fresh has traveled nationally for an array of club appearances and industry events. He has been the choice for various celebrity engagements and he has performed in Cincinnati, OH, Columbus, OH, Atlanta, and New York City, just to name a few spots.

PUBLIC RADIO would hit #9 on the CMJ Hip Hop charts, and the single, SQUARED CIRCLE, was nominated as 2009 Hip Hop Song of the Year by Just Plain Folks. 2009 also saw release of the DJ SLY project, BEYOND IT, with PAULIE RHYME featured on the single “LIKE YOU” with KAORU, which reached 4 on ITunes Japan Top Hip Hop Chart, with the album reaching 10 on the Hip Hop Album Chart.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/pete-tong","Pete Tong","London,","dj, electronica, electronic, house, progressive house","PETE TONG is Britain’s best-loved dance DJ. He doesn’t need an award to prove his popularity and he won’t act cool to keep his credibility. The host of Radio 1’s ground-breaking Essential Selection show for a staggering eight years, he works within the mainstream, but is respected by the underground. Born in Dartford, educated in Rochester and inspired in his teens by the underground soul scene of the late seventies (and the music of the time…by the likes of Funkadelic, James Brown & Evelyn ""Champagne"" King) Pete’s first DJ job was at a wedding. He was 15 years old. A natural born entrepreneur, he began promoting local bands, booking gigs in a nearby town hall and – as part of the Kent ‘Soul Mafia’ – playing black soul & dance music in every club that would give him a gig. After leaving school, he bought a Transit van and set up his own sound system. In 1979, Pete became a journalist for monthly magazine Blues & Soul. By the following year, he was features editor, a position he would hold until ‘83. At the same time, he was appearing on local radio stations such as BBC Radio Medway and London. Then he got his first break with Radio 1, presenting a regular 15 minute ’magazine’ feature on dance music on Peter Powell’s show. ""That was a strange experience, but also very exciting,"" says Pete. ""Radio 1 was at the peak of its popularity. I had to say what was happening on the streets. I was the first person to play Malcolm McLaren’s Buffalo Gals on the radio."" Pete’s knowledge of the dance underground, coupled with his ear for a crossover hit, saw him appointed A&R manager at newly-founded independent label London Records in ‘83. While looking after the careers of pop acts like ’80s girl group Bananarama, he continued to pursue his budding radio career. Put off daytime shows by the discovery that the DJs didn’t pick their own playlists, Pete accepted his own programme on Kent’s newly-launched Invicta station in ‘84. Influenced by radio DJ heroes such as Robbie Vincent, Greg Edwards and Emperor Rosko, he hosted a soul show there for three years, before briefly returning to Radio London. Almost immediately, however, he was poached by Capital Radio, where his weekly dance programme became cult listening with London clubbers. In ’88, in the wake of Acid House, Pete launched his own record label, FFRR, through London Records. His aim was to both embrace the new wave of electronic music flooding into the country from cities such as Detroit and Chicago, and continue to promote his first love, black dance artists. ""The first record I put out was a very cool, quite sexually-explicit single from Chicago called Baby Wants To Ride,"" he recalls. ""I had a rule which was to sign one relatively-indulgent record to every potential big hit. I was aware from the start that you can be hip, but you also have to balance the books."" Inevitably, Pete managed to do both, simultaneously. FFRR’s next releases were cut’n’paste production ‘Bass (How Low Can You Go?)’ by Simon Harris and Salt’n’Pepa’s ‘Push It’, both cool club tracks which went on to storm the charts. They were followed by a stream of influential hits from signings such as Steve ‘Silk’ Hurley, D Mob, Smith & Mighty, Cookie Crew, L’il Louis The Brand New Heavies, Orbital and, of course, Goldie. In ‘91, with an indigenous club culture now thriving in cities across the UK, Pete quit Capital Radio to go national. His Essential Selection show every Friday evening instantly established itself as a welcome to the weekend for a new generation of young clubbers. Heavy on house, but with room for the best breaking techno, jungle, hip hop, funk and soul sounds from both Britain and around the world, it appealed to all tastes in contemporary dance music. Moreover, it merged the cutting-edge with the mainstream. Pete became the country’s best-known dance DJ, while keeping his credibility intact. ""I’m not too concerned with credibility,"" he claims. ""When I started out, I was obsessed by jazz-funk and soul. I couldn’t see life beyond the end of a Donald Byrd album. I was prepared to punch anyone who tried to talk to me about other types of music. But I grew up and discovered that I love hearing new sounds and having my perceptions changed. I didn’t want to be pigeon-holed. I also realised that I could achieve much more by staying on the edge of several scenes, rather than being immersed in just the one."" Perhaps Pete’s biggest contribution to British pop to date was his involvement in the reshaping of BBC Radio 1. When the nation’s biggest radio station decided to re-invent itself in the mid-‘90s, controller Matthew Bannister knew precisely who to ask for help. After Pete’s ideas were taken on board, the likes of Tim Westwood, Danny Rampling, Judge Jules, Carl Cox and, more recently, Fabio and Grooverider, started to appear on Radio 1’s DJ roster. In addition, the station’s daytime playlist began to reflect the extent of the impact of modern electronic music on British kids. In January ‘99, Pete enters his eighth year as the presenter of Essential Selection. With over a million and a half listeners each week, it remains the UK’s most popular dance music radio show, thanks to its host’s consistent ability to change with the times. Its success has also spawned a series of compilation albums, released by FFRR, which to date have sold over 750,000 copies. The latest – which boasts a tangerine-themed cover and the mixing talents of Tong, Paul Oakenfold and, if you’re lucky enough to bag a limited edition copy with a bonus CD, Carl Cox – comes complete with Madonna’s seal of approval. It is the first time ever that the singer has sanctioned the appearance of one of her songs (Drowned World) on a dance mix compilation. During ‘98, Pete made his first forays into television, an area he is keen to explore. In November, he donned different guises to present Clublife, a 90-minute, BBC-broadcast documentary based on Mixmag magazine’s annual dance awards. However, when he does appear with his own TV programme, it won’t be for want of publicity. In the past, he has turned down offers to present Radio 1’s high-profile breakfast and Top 40 shows, not to mention Top Of The Pops. In the meantime, Pete has plenty on his plate. He is a director of Wise Buddah, the production company which makes radio programmes presented by Danny Rampling, Seb Fontiane and Judge Jules and continues to work in A&R for London Records. His pop star credentials include A&R-ing Shakespeare Sister’s hit Stay, which topped the charts for six weeks in ‘92, and played a big role in signing All Saints, whose career he continues to oversee. He was recently musical director on films, Human Traffic and The Beach. The year 2000 proved to be a milestone for Pete – he toured the US for the first time which saw queues around the block, he played on the terrace at Space in Ibiza for the first time, he played in Cape Town and Johannesburg and hosted his own float at Radio 1’s ‘Love Parade’ – ""standing on my float with Jon Carter and Darren Emerson in front of 250,000 Radio 1 listeners was just the best feeling ever – a real moment in history"". 2001 is proving to be an equally exciting year for Pete with another tour of the States starting in March and his first tour of South America scheduled for later in the year. Keeping his feet on the ground in the UK, Pete continues to be a valuable part of the British club scene with regular gigs scheduled at Tribal Sessions at Sankey Soap in Manchester, Code in Birmingham and many other credible commitments. He still remains a key figure at the UK summer festivals including for the first time a performance at T-In The Park as well as his yearly appointment at Creamfields and Homelands (Foot and mouth permitting). Pete’s Radio 1 show ""The Essential Selection"" is now the most listened to radio show on the internet attracting a global audience of over 12 million.

Put off daytime shows by the discovery that the DJs didn’t pick their own playlists, Pete accepted his own programme on Kent’s newly-launched Invicta station in ‘84. Influenced by radio DJ heroes such as Robbie Vincent, Greg Edwards and Emperor Rosko, he hosted a soul show there for three years, before briefly returning to Radio London. Almost immediately, however, he was poached by Capital Radio, where his weekly dance programme became cult listening with London clubbers. In ’88, in the wake of Acid House, Pete launched his own record label, <span class=""caps"">FFRR</span>, through London Records. His aim was to both embrace the new wave of electronic music flooding into the country from cities such as Detroit and Chicago, and continue to promote his first love, black dance artists. ""The first record I put out was a very cool, quite sexually-explicit single from Chicago called Baby Wants To Ride,"" he recalls. ""I had a rule which was to sign one relatively-indulgent record to every potential big hit. I was aware from the start that you can be hip, but you also have to balance the books."" Inevitably, Pete managed to do both, simultaneously. <span class=""caps"">FFRR</span>’s next releases were cut’n’paste production ‘Bass (How Low Can You Go?)’ by Simon Harris and Salt’n’Pepa’s ‘Push It’, both cool club tracks which went on to storm the charts. They were followed by a stream of influential hits from signings such as Steve ‘Silk’ Hurley, D Mob, Smith & Mighty, Cookie Crew, L’il Louis The Brand New Heavies, Orbital and, of course, Goldie. In ‘91, with an indigenous club culture now thriving in cities across the UK, Pete quit Capital Radio to go national. His Essential Selection show every Friday evening instantly established itself as a welcome to the weekend for a new generation of young clubbers. Heavy on house, but with room for the best breaking techno, jungle, hip hop, funk and soul sounds from both Britain and around the world, it appealed to all tastes in contemporary dance music. Moreover, it merged the cutting-edge with the mainstream. Pete became the country’s best-known dance DJ, while keeping his credibility intact. ""I’m not too concerned with credibility,"" he claims. ""When I started out, I was obsessed by jazz-funk and soul. I couldn’t see life beyond the end of a Donald Byrd album. I was prepared to punch anyone who tried to talk to me about other types of music. But I grew up and discovered that I love hearing new sounds and having my perceptions changed. I didn’t want to be pigeon-holed. I also realised that I could achieve much more by staying on the edge of several scenes, rather than being immersed in just the one."" Perhaps Pete’s biggest contribution to British pop to date was his involvement in the reshaping of <span class=""caps"">BBC</span> Radio 1. When the nation’s biggest radio station decided to re-invent itself in the mid-‘90s, controller Matthew Bannister knew precisely who to ask for help. After Pete’s ideas were taken on board, the likes of Tim Westwood, Danny Rampling, Judge Jules, Carl Cox and, more recently, Fabio and Grooverider, started to appear on Radio 1’s DJ roster. In addition, the station’s daytime playlist began to reflect the extent of the impact of modern electronic music on British kids. In January ‘99, Pete enters his eighth year as the presenter of Essential Selection. With over a million and a half listeners each week, it remains the UK’s most popular dance music radio show, thanks to its host’s consistent ability to change with the times. Its success has also spawned a series of compilation albums, released by <span class=""caps"">FFRR</span>, which to date have sold over 750,000 copies. The latest – which boasts a tangerine-themed cover and the mixing talents of Tong, Paul Oakenfold and, if you’re lucky enough to bag a limited edition copy with a bonus CD, Carl Cox – comes complete with Madonna’s seal of approval. It is the first time ever that the singer has sanctioned the appearance of one of her songs (Drowned World) on a dance mix compilation. During ‘98, Pete made his first forays into television, an area he is keen to explore. In November, he donned different guises to present Clublife, a 90-minute, <span class=""caps"">BBC</span>-broadcast documentary based on Mixmag magazine’s annual dance awards. However, when he does appear with his own TV programme, it won’t be for want of publicity. In the past, he has turned down offers to present Radio 1’s high-profile breakfast and Top 40 shows, not to mention Top Of The Pops. In the meantime, Pete has plenty on his plate. He is a director of Wise Buddah, the production company which makes radio programmes presented by Danny Rampling, Seb Fontiane and Judge Jules and continues to work in A&R for London Records. His pop star credentials include A&R-ing Shakespeare Sister’s hit Stay, which topped the charts for six weeks in ‘92, and played a big role in signing All Saints, whose career he continues to oversee. He was recently musical director on films, Human Traffic and The Beach. The year 2000 proved to be a milestone for Pete – he toured the US for the first time which saw queues around the block, he played on the terrace at Space in Ibiza for the first time, he played in Cape Town and Johannesburg and hosted his own float at Radio 1’s ‘Love Parade’ – ""standing on my float with Jon Carter and Darren Emerson in front of 250,000 Radio 1 listeners was just the best feeling ever – a real moment in history"". 2001 is proving to be an equally exciting year for Pete with another tour of the States starting in March and his first tour of South America scheduled for later in the year. Keeping his feet on the ground in the UK, Pete continues to be a valuable part of the British club scene with regular gigs scheduled at Tribal Sessions at Sankey Soap in Manchester, Code in Birmingham and many other credible commitments. He still remains a key figure at the UK summer festivals including for the first time a performance at T-In The Park as well as his yearly appointment at Creamfields and Homelands (Foot and mouth permitting). Pete’s Radio 1 show ""The Essential Selection"" is now the most listened to radio show on the internet attracting a global audience of over 12 million. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Pete+Tong"" target=""_blank"">Listen at Last.fm</a></p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7430651/2eef180bd807b2a14d70393f1c2871f9_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/ixmffxGIBCY?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

The original band name, along with its line-up, took many different forms as members came and went, as well as countless songs.

In the heat of summer, 2011, they picked up their dirty, southern roots and traveled seven hours north to Nashville, Tennessee, to become contributing members of the town’s thriving rock ‘n’ roll community. They were accompanied by Brannon Barnett, who would leave his stamp on the new band, being featured in a few recordings on guitar. Scott Harper was recruited as well, a few months after the move. Within a few more months the band had written several songs, six of which were recorded live at The Bomb Shelter studio in East Nashville.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/eric-hisaw","Eric Hisaw","Las Cruces New Mexico/ Austin Texas","","This August roots rocking Americana songwriter Eric Hisaw releases his fifth full length album Ghost Stories. A mix of Rolling Stones inspired rock’n’roll and the storytelling lyricism of Texas outlaw country, Lonestar Music’s Richard Skanse says “with the 10 just-about-perfect tales of hard-traveled and weary-hearted workingman blues… the journeyman songwriter, guitarist and singer delivers his first stone-cold masterpiece”. While Ghost Stories contains many of the same themes Hisaw’s previous work has covered, family, small town adolescence, wanderlust and dysfunction, this time out the songs are more personal. “Most every song is based on something that actually happened to me, even when I changed names and places, I still left a big piece of myself in there.” Adding to the lyrical grittiness is a tougher rocking sound. Longtime musical accoplices drummer Vicente Rodriguez and bassist/keyboardist Ron Flynt return. “We’ve played a lot of gigs and made several records together now and have developed a real natural way of playing off one another. The record has a real ‘live in the studio’ feeling. I mean there’s a ton of overdubs on there, I play three guitars on almost every song, but most of the hooks and the real essence of the songs were caught in the basic tracks on day one.” The addition of legendary steel guitar master Lloyd Maines on four tracks is an added bonus. Maines blends tasteful pedal steel with Hisaw’s telecaster fills on a pair of tunes and contributes dobro and lapsteel on two others. Two artists with albums recently produced by Hisaw add background vocals. Chrissy Flatt ( New Mystery Girl) handles the lion’s share of the harmonies, while country singer-songwriter Bracken Hale chips in on one cut. The opening track sets the tone, tracing the adolescent memories of friends and relatives gone missing over stinging guitar lines and driving drums. “Johnston County” is a Chuck Berry styled rocker about an eye opening road trip with an elder. “Payphone” captures a moment in time with a Johnny Cash meets JJ Cale train beat and atmospheric pedal steel guitar. “California”, “Lonely Road” and “Don’t Live Here” are rocking takes on friends and lovers from the past, while “The Love She Wants” is a shuffling country weeper. “Talk To Me” is roots-rock meets 70’s glam. The album finishes up with “Albuquerque” an uptempo Bakersfield influenced tale about a lost hitchiker at a New Mexico truckstop, and “Sleep” a waltz time lullaby to the child of hard partying parents. Born and raised in Las Cruces, NM and based in Austin, Tx for the better part of the last two decades, Hisaw has released five albums of original hard driving country rock. His previous two efforts 2006’s The Crosses and 2008’s Nature of the Blues made positive headway in the grassroots press and radio, reaching #2 and #3 respectively on the Freeform American Roots chart, living up to the promise made by his youthful 2000 debut Thing About Trains. Now in 2011 Ghost Stories finds the artist hitting his stride, the evocative imagery and lyrical density countered by the spririt in the grooves and bound together by the dedication and experience of a hard traveled seeker committed to reporting his findings from the lost highway. A great listen for fans of Joe Ely, Dave Alvin, Steve Earle and Alejandro Escovedo. “Eric Hisaw’s songwriting is uncorrupted and bulletproof. He’s a check you can cash at the bank of cool.” – Ray Wylie Hubbard “Many people including millionaire rockstars, write and sing about working class life, but Hisaw has and edge on all of them, authenticity…this is powerful stuff.” – John Conquest, 3rd Coast Music","<p>This August roots rocking Americana songwriter Eric Hisaw releases his fifth full length album Ghost Stories.

It’s a pretty standard, unremarkable story — except it took place in Iran, where, as Koory puts it, “you can find instruments, but the problem is that you’re probably going to get the shittiest ones, at triple the price,” and where the legality of pop music is, he says, similar to that of marijuana: You can buy the supplies, but don’t get caught fooling with the substance. In Brooklyn, where Yellow Dogs currently reside, forming a post-punk band with your friends is about as remarkable an activity as ordering Thai food. In Tehran, it was like more like a covert operation. And, lo and behold, the music they produced, the four-song EP Upper Class Complexity, crackles with more life, wit, tension and imagination than most of their peers. Maybe there’s something to be said for having to work for it.The sound of Upper Class Complexityfeels a little out-of-step with the current Brooklyn-scene moment, but in the best possible way: While more bands are chasing hazy good vibes and New Zealand-inspired indie jangle (Real Estate‘s self-titled appears to be slowly morphing into some kids’ Is This It?), Yellow Dogs’ music harks back to a moment when every band had a busily riding hi-hat, rhythmic stabs of guitar, and a head full of frayed nerves: the brittle post-punk moment of circa-2003. Yellow Dogs songs are fiendish, caffeinated little puzzles of warily circling guitar and keyboards, each element feeling close and cramped, like riders stuck in a stalled elevator.With their just-so vintage keyboard sounds, the echo-laden recording atmosphere, and the herky-jerk mid-song breakdowns, these songs seem to spring from years’ worth of close study of post-punk deep catalog. Imagine our surprise, then, when the members confessed to not hearing most of these touchstones until after they had found their sound: apart from Joy Division and the Clash, they learned at the feet of those who worshiped the sound with the same reverence they did: Rancid, in other words, was a big influence. But we can’t detect a single hint of attenuation in the resulting music. “The City,” which closes the EP, is a sneering, evil two-chord vamp that just keeps breaking down into smaller and smaller parts, until finally it’s nothing more than a spidery guitar line crawling up your backbone. The song could easily go on for nine minutes and never peter out — live, we hear, it sometimes does — but they cut it off, sharp and still sparking, before it hits five minutes: one last expertly deployed cold-water bucket to the face. It only proves that you don’t always need first-hand experience with the source to catch the spirit.","<p>Koory, Looloosh and Obaash met and formed the way of young rock bands since time immemorial: Hanging out at a local park as teenagers, among skaters and punk rockers, they bonded over their mutual tastes and began playing together.

As the role model for television’s Partridge Family, and a fine act in their own right, they had three top-ten singles with “Hair,” “The Rain, the Park and Other Things (Flower Girl),” and “We Can Fly.” Soon after those successes, Susan went into her first retirement at the tender age of 12. The ‘80s found Susan working with cult figure Dwight Twilley, her harmonies adding sparkle to many of Twilley’s greatest tracks, including his hit single “Girls.” Pop lovers could also spot her guesting with Redd Kross and the Smithereens. In the early ’90sThe Cowsills launched a fullfledged reunion, with new songs in a solid powerpop vein, and released the Global album, becoming cult heroes all over again. More guest appearances by Susan during this time were on two Hootie and the Blowfish records, Jules Shear, Kate Jacobs, and Giant Sand. Susan’s life and music took a fateful turn when she joined the popular roots-pop combo, the Continental Drifters. Susan’s exuberant stage presence and beautiful vocals proved an asset to the band. The Drifters made three critically-acclaimed albums, all of which recorded Susan blossoming as a songwriter. The 1999 disc Vermilion led off with Susan’s country-pop gem, “The Rain Song.” One publication gloated, “…vocal on the chorus…is the most heartbreaking musical moment of 1999.” (Gambit Weekly, Dec. 28, 1999) The song has since been covered by both The Bangles and Hootie and the Blowfish. And 2001’s Better Day album found her contributing four songs (one co-written with drummer, Russ Broussard). No Depression magazine noted on these songs, “…are the stuff big-time solo careers are made of.” Susan’s Cowsill’s solo album Just Believe It is the next logical step after the Drifters. Susan continues to write beautifully melodic songs, taking sympathetic looks at the imperfictions of life and love. Susan Cowsill’s gumbo sound springs from ‘60s pop roots with seasonings of Louisiana groove, country, and rock. Whether she’s doing her own material or covering the likes of Sandy Denny or Lucinda Williams, she can always connect with a haunting tune and emotive lyrics. As Bilboard Magazine expresses,“Cowsill…mines a child-like vulnerability, as she employs her achingly tarnished voice to a simple and moving effect.” Susan’s songs and voice have all the ingredients and delivery for her to easily be a hugely successful ‘crossover’ artist.","<p><span style=""font-family: arial, arial, sans-serif, helvetica; font-size: 11px; color: #ddddff; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;""><br /> <p style=""font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif, helvetica; font: normal normal normal 11px/normal arial; text-transform: none; padding-left: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 0px;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Not many people were singing on hit singles and touring the world when their friends were still in kindergarten, but </span><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-size: 11px;""><span style=""text-decoration: none;"">The Cowsills</span></span></span></span></span><span style=""color: #000000;""> became a cherished part of ‘60s pop culture.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/paula-held","Paula Held","Peace Dale, RI","","BIO: Paula started writing songs at age 15 when she learned to play the guitar. She remembers taking two or three lessons and learning the 21 major, minor and 7th chords. At an early age, Paula studied violin, piano and concert harp. Her father, Arthur Custer, a Nadia Boulanger-trained musician and composer, encouraged her classical training, but by the time she turned 15, Paula had discovered Folk Music and a passion for songwriting. Like most kids of the 60s, she emulated her musical heroes of the day: Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, the Beatles and James Taylor. She spent the next decade woodshedding and singing with various bands at coffeehouses in her adopted town of Tallahassee, Florida. At age 26, with the birth of her son John, she put away her guitar and turned her attention to motherhood. In the midst of that provocative life experience, Paula rediscovered the Swing Era and fell in love with Jazz. A defining moment occurred in early April, 1990, as she was listening to public radio and Ella Fitzgerald singing Cole Porters tune, Easy to Love. The music spoke to her so strongly that she organized a quartet of local jazz musicians from the university, and by the end of the summer was performing regularly a repertoire of songs that ran the gamut from Duke Ellington and Jimmy Van Heusen to Antonio Carlos Jobim. She took courses in theory and voice, embracing the music that once poured through her Rhode Island home as a girl. By the late 90s, with her son in college, Paula began writing again in earnest, intent on developing her own sound and voice. In 2002, she left her day job and moved to a remote river town in Floridas Panhandle to work on her music. She began gigging regularly to pay the bills, and landed a job as the house musician on Friday nights at the Gibson Inn in Apalachicola. There she developed a following around her eclectic cover and original material. Friends gathered together funds to help her record several of her songs, and she released her 5 Songs CD in the Spring of 2003. Paulas sound has been described as breathy and intimate, jazzy and folky, Judy Collins meets Nancy Wilson, meets Bucky Pizzarelli, referring to her original music from her CD. She's received regular air play from WVFS-FM in Tallahassee, FL, WUFT-FM in Gainesville, FL, and KEOS-FM in College Station, TX. She's performed in concert at the Theatre of Memory in High Springs, Florida and various venues in Tallahassee, Florida. She was runner up at Eddie's Attic's famed Songwriter's Shootout in Atlanta, Georgia. In the Fall of 2003 and 2004, she appeared as a guest artist at the Annual Apalachicola Jazz, Blues and Folk Festival, head-lined by Miami Jazzman Joe Donato. In 2005 she performed at the Frank Brown International Songwriter's Festival in Florabama. Paula now lives and performs in Austin, TX.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/allison-weiss-","Allison Weiss","Brooklyn, NY","indie, singer-songwriter, female vocalists, acoustic","My name is Allison Weiss. I play guitar and tell my secrets to audiences. When I don’t hate the world, I’m completely in love with it. My passions in life are music, graphic design, laughing and making people laugh, having awesome conversations, the internet, the concept of love, and attempting to solve problems and/or win the hearts of boys through catchy songs of hope. I like thunderstorms. I like staying in the movie theater till the film runs off the roll. I like you. I like me. I like “us”. I’ve loved music for as long as I can remember, and I played piano off and on as a kid. In 9th grade I needed to impress a boy in my creative writing class, so I decided to become a punk rock star. I asked my dad to teach me the guitar, and a few power chords later, my plan worked! The boy asked me out. I had my first boyfriend! A month later our relationship ended, but my love for the guitar lived on. Throughout high school I played in multiple terrible metal and punk bands before being introduced to “emo” music and picking up the acoustic guitar. I formed a duo with a close friend and spent a summer honing my songwriting and performing skills. As soon as I got to college in 2005, I became a solo artist. I spent the first two years paying my dues in this beautiful town I now call my home, and I plan to keep on doing what it takes to play my music for anyone who wants to listen. Heavily influenced by artists like Rilo Kiley, Tegan & Sara, Kevin Devine, and countless others from various genres, I developed a unique style of indiepopfolkrock. Clever lyrics, catchy hooks, tons of self-deprecation. Last year I released my first record, got to open for The Early November, played in the 500 Songs For Kids benefit concert, and rocked the outdoor stage at AthFest. I was nominated Best Solo Performer in the Flagpole Athens Music Awards. I also traveled over 4,000 miles on self-booked tours through the midwest and the east coast. I played the coolest venues in the coolest cities. I made a ton of friends and earned a comfy spot in the DIY indie scene. Two Thousand Eight looks promising so far! I have the most awesome band in the world, made up of my brother AJ on backup guitar/keys, Alec Wooden on the bass, and Donovan Babb on drums. We’re recording an EP that’s going to get so stuck in your head you won’t even be able to handle it.","<p>My name is Allison Weiss. I play guitar and tell my secrets to audiences.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/john-digweed","John Digweed","","","If you’re not an avid follower of dance music but are tuned into popular culture at all you’ve likely experienced music touched by the hands of John Digweed. Originally hailing from England but having clearly arrived on the global scene well over a decade ago John has long since cemented his name in the pages of dance music history. His list of achievements is groundbreaking to say the least. Highlights of which would be the first proper dj mix compilation (“The Mix Collection”, done with Sasha), being the first British dj to hold a residency at what was then the world’s most well known club in NYC (Twilo, also with Sasha) as well as having remixed music by William Orbit, Underworld, Quincy Jones, Mr Fogg and New Order. John Digweed is a DJ’s DJ. The beauty of what he does lies in just how different he really is from his contemporaries. From his early beginnings in Hastings, England at the age of 15 in the blossoming scene of acid house to the apex of the international dj’ing world he has created and maintained a level of integrity that is the benchmark for both dj’s and producers globally. In fact, he has reached the very top of his profession, being voted #1 in a voter’s poll. John Digweed has become the people’s choice while maintaining his longstanding presence in underground dance culture. His popularity as both a dj and a person seems to have no limits, but his efforts transcend dj’ing alone, he is as much a producer and promoter. His moniker “Bedrock” is actually three things: a record label, a promotions company and a studio production partnership with Nick Muir. His management and creative direction for the Bedrock record label spans over 12 years with the vision and creative insight to seek out mixes and remixes from the worlds best producers . To have a record released on Bedrock serves as the global stamp of production quality, ingenuity and integrity for underground producers worldwide. In fact, the name John Digweed is synonymous with those very qualities. From the nights he has either created or been a part of (Bedrock, Northern Exposure) to his world renowned mix cd’s (Renaissance, GU, Northern Exposure, Transitions and Bedrock compilation album`s 10 ,11 12 and Structures) he has consistently produced characteristic products that stay in demand, himself included. As one half of Bedrock the production duo he has landed two tracks in the top 40 (“Heaven Scent” and “For What You Dream Of”) the latter of which made it into the hit movie “Trainspotting”. He has even tried a bit of acting himself (“Groove”). He and Nick Muir as Bedrock the production team also scored a Hollywood film (“Stark Raving Mad”) as well as the animated release of “Spider-Man” for Sony / MTV. He’s toured every corner of the planet including bus tours in the USA (Delta Heavy and Area 2 (with David Bowie and Moby) , The legendary Big Beach Boutique in Brighton with Fatboy slim had him gladly performing to 250,000 and most recently selling out the O2 Brixton Academy for Bedrock`s 12th Anniversary. His Transitions Radio show is now it`s 10th year and is still one of the most successful dance music shows, being broadcast to over 30 countries across the world to a weekly audience of over 12 million. As a person John’s lack of pretense is enveloped in imagination and invention. Good reason for John being one of the most respected, analyzed and imitated dj’s in the world. Digweed is both solid and durable with unyielding precision. His sinuous dj’ing and production sound has become its own convincing dance ethic. He is centered to the principles of life, living and friends in such a way that he generates an aura of self-explanatory excitement and enthusiasm. Without heroic pretensions his sets are filled with moodiness and musical mystery but held down with a punchy distinctiveness and earthly rhythm. Always emanating a sense of boundlessness he overlaps dream events that spill into reality with an enormous certainty.","<p>If you’re not an avid follower of dance music but are tuned into popular culture at all you’ve likely experienced music touched by the hands of John Digweed.

Spotlight Album American Songwriter On ""Sunday Shoes"" , Nels Andrews proves that he deserves a spot in the ranks of today's Americana heroes. His rootsy brand of mellow folk-rock conjures up memories of Jay Farrar and his story as an Albuquerque carpenter turned inspired musician sounds like a Western version o Ray LaMontagne. With help of backing band The El Paso Eyepatch, Andrews itch for storytelling reaches new musical heights. On “Jesse's Mom” Andrews writes “Jesse's mom thought she was born with gypsy in her blood/when she layed down ith a black man in the West Arkansas mud/back before those things were done.” This stuff of Larry Mcmurtry novels has flooded Andrews' imagination and captivated this particular writer. With the perfect accompaniment of guitar, banjo and the Emmylou Harris-esque backup vocals of Michelle Collins, in songs like “Milk and Honey” and “Meadowlake”, Andrews shows he's at the top of his craft. live review The Maze @ Cabaret, Nottingham – 9th May 2005 Americana UK For his second visit to the UK to promote the acclaimed “Sunday Shoes”, Nels Andrews is in electric mode, with the bulk of his band to back him. An enigmatic figure, six foot of brooding intensity with a flower on his guitar head, he is plagued by tuning problems throughout, but nevertheless delivers an awesome set. His music, while excellent in the semi-acoustic duo mode he toured last year, moves up a level with the band. Guitarist Jeffrey Richards, loose of limb and lithe of note, relishes the opportunity to show his chops, switching between banjo and guitar, while the sound is filled out by bass and drums. Pretty much all of “Sunday Shoes” makes an appearance, with Nels filling in some background on most of the songs gestation. So we get the prostitute fancier at the bus stop of “Central Ave. Romance”, his Devon ex on “Broken Conversation” and many more. The audience is transfixed, no one leaves, no one goes to the bar, they just listen, to a lyricist whose words have a power and intensity that is rarely matched, and remind you of the glory days of Morrison and Dylan, whether it’s the “long women in short dresses” of “Petal To A Bee” or “Denim Scarecrow”’s narrator who “wear’s his sex like a shirt that’s two sizes small”. His intensity is both exhilarating and enervating, and however long he played for, it was probably enough, though at the time I thought he could have gone on forever, otherwise I would have been so engrossed that I’d have forgotten to breathe. Sometimes going to see someone for a second time can be a disappointment. You don’t have the “shock of the new” to sustain you, and your inevitably high expectations are often not lived up to. Not with Nels Andrews though. Great as his last time out was, this is simply superlative. He’s over here for a while longer, get out there and catch him now.

Obssesed with playing guitars, at age 12, Simon Witvrouw already joines the stage with Filip Casteels (El Fish) and Jean-Marie Aerts (TC Matic), reaches on the age of 18 a finalist place on the Gibson International Jazz Guitar Competition in Montreux Switserland and gets an invitation by Frank Vaganee to play as a geust musician with the famous Brussels Jazz Orchestra. Simon plays the next few years regularly with: Dre Pallemaerts, Filip Casteels, Willywilly (The Scabs), Christoph Erbstösser, Yannick Peeters (Het Zesde Metaal), Sara Meyer (El Tattoo Del Tigre), etc. But the urge to start a group with his own songs, drawing on personal experiences, brings him together with Bart Borremans on bass (Isbells, Buscemi, Jazztafari, etc), Koen Mertens on drums (Jef Neve, Sammy Cuba, Goudi, Buscemi, Joy Adegoke, etc) and on guitars Thijs El Boucho (The Belbouchos, Abattoir Fermé, Charlatan resident DJ). Bart Borremans is later replaced by, musical bass miracle, PJ Seaux. PJ started as a trumpet player, immersed himself in jazz piano and then switched over to bass wich made him play with: Stijn Meuris, Selah Sue (co-composed Selah’s hit “This World”), etc. Mojostar is formed as a group, ready to rock and, with all the additional baggage of musical influences from the musicians, record their debut album ! But unfortunately, just before signing the record contract, everything changes by Simon’s nearly fatal motorcycle accident. A doctor, passing the accident, saves Simon’s life by reanimating him but he still has shattered knees and a left hand broken on several places. Afer the operations, now also metal strings in his body and months of rehabilitation, he’s fully ready to play guitar again ! One week ICP, the legendary “Shelle” at the controls, extra weeks at the Quest4 Studio of the independent label, cooperation with producers Yannic Fonderie (Geike, Zap Mama, etc) and Rafael Van Assche (owner Quest4 Records), results in the debut album “Mojostar”. Nederlands: -———- Mojostar werd opgericht door jong gitaarwonder Simon Witvrouw en bestaat uit een verzameling bezielde live-muzikanten, elk komende met een rijk muzikaal verleden (met niet de minsten op hun persoonlijke palmares). Bezeten door gitaar spelen brengt, op 12 jarige leeftijd, Simon Witvrouw al op het podium met zijn helden: Filip Casteels (El Fish) en Jean-Marie Aerts (TC Matic), behaalt dan op 18 jarige leeftijd een finalisten plaats op de Gibson International Jazz Guitar Competition in Montreux Zwitserland en wordt datzelfde jaar ook door Frank Vaganee uitgenodigd als gastmuzikant bij het befaamde Brussels Jazz Orchestra. Simon speelt de daarop volgende jaren samen met oa Dre Pallemaerts, Filip Casteels, Willywilly (The Scabs), Christoph Erbstösser, Yannick Peeters (Het Zesde Metaal), Sara Meyer (El Tattoo Del Tigre), etc. Iedereen herkent in Simon een super gepassioneerde en getalenteerde gitarist. De drang om een groep te starten met zijn eigen nummers, puttend uit persoonlijke ervaringen, brengen hem samen met oa : Bart Borremans op bass (Isbells, Buscemi, Jazztafari, etc), Koen Mertens op drums (Jef Neve, Goudi, Balaxy Orchestra, Joy Adegoke, etc) en op gitaren Thijs El Boucho (The Belbouchos, Abattoir Fermé, Charlatan resident DJ). Bart Borremans wordt later vervangen door, muzikaal basswonder, PJ Seaux. PJ startte als trompettist, verdiepte zich daarna op jazz piano en schakelde dan over op bass wat hem ondertussen al deed samenspelen met oa Selah Sue (co-componeerde ook Selah’s hit “This World”), Stijn Meuris, etc. Mojostar is compleet als groep en klaar om pure rock, met alle bijkomende invloeden uit de muzikale bagage van de muzikanten, op een album vast te leggen. Maar net voor het tekenen van het platencontract verandert alles door Simon’s bijna fataal motoraccident. Een, net voorbij het ongeval rijdende, dokteres redt zijn leven door hem te reanimeren maar Simon houdt er verbrijzelde knieen en een op meerdere plaatsen gebroken linkerhand aan over. Na de operaties, nu ook metalen snaren in zijn lichaam en maanden revalidatie, is hij gelukkig terug volledig in staat om gitaar te spelen. Een week ICP, de legendarische enthousiaste “Shelle” aan de knoppen, extra weken in de studio van het Quest4 platenlabel, samenwerking met producers Yannic Fonderie (Geike, Zap Mama, etc) en Rafael Van Assche (eigenaar Quest4 ), resulteert in hun debuutalbum “Mojostar”. Français : -——- Mojostar est créé par Simon Witvrouw, jeune guitariste talentueux , et est formé par des musiciens enthousiastes, chacun doté d’un grand talent musical. Simon Witvrouw est, à 12 ans déjà, fou de la guitare, et rencontre ses idoles sur la scène : Filip Casteels (El Fish) et Jean-Marie Aerts (TC Matic). A 18 ans il atteind la finale de la compétition Gibson International Jazz Guitar Competition à Montreux en Suisse. La même année il est invité par Frank Vaganee comme musicien dans le Brussels Jazz Orchestra renommé. Les années suivantes, il joue entre autres avec Dre Pallemaerts, Filip Casteels, Willywilly (The Scabs), Christoph Erbstösser, Yannick Peeters (Het zesde Metaal), Sara Meyer (El Tattoo Del Tigre) etc. Chacun d’eux reconnaît en lui un guitariste super passionné et plein de talent. L’envie de former un groupe pour jouer ses propres compositions, puisant dans ses expériences personnelles, le met en contact avec e.a. Bart Borremans, bassiste (Isbells, Buscemi, Jazztafari, etc), Koen Mertens, batteur (Jef Neve, Goudi, Balaxy Orchestra, etc) et Thijs El Boucho, guitariste (The Belbouchos, Abattoir Fermé, Charlatan resident DJ). Plus tard Bart Borremans est remplacé par PJ Seaux. Celui-ci débutait comme trompettiste, se plongeait dans le jazz piano et se dirigeait enfin vers le bass où il avait rencontré e.a. Selah Sue ( il était co-compositeur de “This world”) et Stijn Meuris. Complet comme groupe, Mojostar est prêt pour composer un album de rock pur, avec les différentes influences musicales de chaque musicien. Mais juste avant la signature du contract, tout a changé à cause d’un accident moto presque fatal. Une femme médecin, passant par hasard, a sauvé la vie de Simon en le réanimant. Malheurusement il a les genoux brisés et sa main gauche est fracturée à plusieurs endroits. Après des opérations et des mois de révalidation, il est de nouveau capable de jouer de la guitare, même avec des cordes métalliques dans son corps. Une semaine ICP, l’enthousiaste et légendaire “Shelle” aux boutons, des semaines extra dans le studio de Quest4 Records , la collaboration avec les producteurs Yannic Fonderie ( Geike, Zap Mama etc.) et Rafael Van Assche (propriétaire Quest4) résulte dans un premier album “Mojostar”.","<p>English:<br /> <del>-</del>——</p> <p>Mojostar was founded by Simon Witvrouw and consists of a collection of spirited live musicians, each representing a rich musical past.</p> <p>Obssesed with playing guitars, at age 12, Simon Witvrouw already joines the stage with Filip Casteels (El Fish) and Jean-Marie Aerts (TC Matic), reaches on the age of 18 a finalist place on the Gibson International Jazz Guitar Competition in Montreux Switserland and gets an invitation by Frank Vaganee to play as a geust musician with the famous Brussels Jazz Orchestra.

One week <span class=""caps"">ICP</span>, the legendary “Shelle” at the controls, extra weeks at the Quest4 Studio of the independent label, cooperation with producers Yannic Fonderie (Geike, Zap Mama, etc) and Rafael Van Assche (owner Quest4 Records), results in the debut album “Mojostar”.</p> <p>Nederlands:<br /> <del>-</del>———-</p> <p>Mojostar werd opgericht door jong gitaarwonder Simon Witvrouw en bestaat uit een verzameling bezielde live-muzikanten, elk komende met een rijk muzikaal verleden (met niet de minsten op hun persoonlijke palmares).<br /> Bezeten door gitaar spelen brengt, op 12 jarige leeftijd, Simon Witvrouw al op het podium met zijn helden: Filip Casteels (El Fish) en Jean-Marie Aerts (TC Matic), behaalt dan op 18 jarige leeftijd een finalisten plaats op de Gibson International Jazz Guitar Competition in Montreux Zwitserland<br /> en wordt datzelfde jaar ook door Frank Vaganee uitgenodigd als gastmuzikant bij het befaamde Brussels Jazz Orchestra. Simon speelt de daarop volgende jaren samen met oa Dre Pallemaerts, Filip Casteels, Willywilly (The Scabs), Christoph Erbstösser, Yannick Peeters (Het Zesde Metaal), Sara Meyer (El Tattoo Del Tigre), etc. <br /> Iedereen herkent in Simon een super gepassioneerde en getalenteerde gitarist.<br /> De drang om een groep te starten met zijn eigen nummers, puttend uit persoonlijke ervaringen, brengen hem samen met oa : Bart Borremans op bass (Isbells, Buscemi, Jazztafari, etc), Koen Mertens op drums (Jef Neve, Goudi, Balaxy Orchestra, Joy Adegoke, etc) en op gitaren Thijs El Boucho (The Belbouchos, Abattoir Fermé, Charlatan resident DJ).<br /> Bart Borremans wordt later vervangen door, muzikaal basswonder, PJ Seaux. PJ startte als trompettist, verdiepte zich daarna op jazz piano en schakelde dan over op bass wat hem ondertussen al deed samenspelen met oa Selah Sue (co-componeerde ook Selah’s hit “This World”), Stijn<br /> Meuris, etc.<br /> Mojostar is compleet als groep en klaar om pure rock, met alle bijkomende invloeden uit de muzikale bagage van de muzikanten, op een album vast te leggen. Maar net voor het tekenen van het platencontract verandert alles door Simon’s bijna fataal motoraccident. Een, net voorbij het ongeval rijdende, dokteres redt zijn leven door hem te reanimeren maar Simon houdt er verbrijzelde knieen en een op meerdere plaatsen gebroken linkerhand aan over. Na de operaties, nu ook metalen snaren in zijn lichaam en maanden revalidatie, is hij gelukkig terug volledig in staat om gitaar te spelen.<br /> Een week <span class=""caps"">ICP</span>, de legendarische enthousiaste “Shelle” aan de knoppen, extra weken in de studio van het Quest4 platenlabel, samenwerking met producers Yannic Fonderie (Geike, Zap Mama, etc) en Rafael Van Assche (eigenaar Quest4 ), resulteert in hun debuutalbum “Mojostar”.</p> <p>Français :<br /> <del>-</del>——-</p> <p>Mojostar est créé par Simon Witvrouw, jeune guitariste talentueux , et est formé par des musiciens<br /> enthousiastes, chacun doté d’un grand talent musical.<br /> Simon Witvrouw est, à 12 ans déjà, fou de la guitare, et rencontre ses idoles sur la scène : Filip Casteels (El Fish) et Jean-Marie Aerts (TC Matic). A 18 ans il atteind la finale de la compétition Gibson International Jazz Guitar Competition à Montreux en Suisse. La même année il est invité par Frank Vaganee comme musicien dans le Brussels Jazz Orchestra<br /> renommé. Les années suivantes, il joue entre autres avec Dre Pallemaerts, Filip Casteels, Willywilly (The Scabs), Christoph Erbstösser, Yannick Peeters (Het zesde Metaal), Sara Meyer (El Tattoo Del Tigre) etc. Chacun d’eux reconnaît en lui un guitariste super passionné et plein de talent.<br /> L’envie de former un groupe pour jouer ses propres compositions, puisant dans ses expériences personnelles, le met en contact avec e.a. Bart Borremans, bassiste (Isbells, Buscemi, Jazztafari, etc), Koen Mertens, batteur (Jef Neve, Goudi, Balaxy Orchestra, etc) et Thijs El Boucho,<br /> guitariste (The Belbouchos, Abattoir Fermé, Charlatan resident DJ).<br /> Plus tard Bart Borremans est remplacé par PJ Seaux. Celui-ci débutait comme trompettiste, se plongeait dans le jazz piano et se dirigeait enfin vers le bass où il avait rencontré e.a. Selah Sue ( il était co-compositeur de “This world”) et Stijn Meuris. <br /> Complet comme groupe, Mojostar est prêt pour composer un album de rock pur, avec les différentes influences musicales de chaque musicien. Mais juste avant la signature du contract, tout a changé à cause d’un accident moto presque fatal. Une femme médecin, passant par hasard, a sauvé la vie de Simon en le réanimant. Malheurusement il a les genoux brisés et sa main gauche est fracturée à plusieurs endroits. Après des opérations et des mois de révalidation, il est de nouveau capable de<br /> jouer de la guitare, même avec des cordes métalliques dans son corps.<br /> Une semaine <span class=""caps"">ICP</span>, l’enthousiaste et légendaire “Shelle” aux boutons, des semaines extra dans le studio de Quest4 Records , la collaboration avec les producteurs Yannic Fonderie ( Geike, Zap Mama etc.) et Rafael Van Assche (propriétaire Quest4) résulte dans un premier album “Mojostar”.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7880124/d0af4bb95688e6ca58edcfd3f966b8c1_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/LOpMX4bWCEc?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/walla","WALLA","Gary, Indiana","","“There weren’t many places you could go and get loud so I just sang in my car. When people ask me today how I’m able to sing so loud I tell them it’s because I just got used to trying to sing above Freddy Mercury blasting on my car stereo. I would drive around town for hours singing at the top of my lungs. It was the only place I could go to let it out!” -Chris Wallace on growing up in Hebron, Indiana One of the first things you learn about Chris Wallace is that he dreams BIG. His oversized presence practically screams with confidence and a sense of control beyond his years, and he puts it all on full display as he preps for the release of his first solo album, due this summer. Coming out of the gate strong, Chris is already receiving the kind of reception that artists dream about: Upon hearing Chris’ new music, MTV added Chris directly into Buzzworthy rotation and proclaimed that, “Critics are going so far as to call him the male Katy Perry, a compliment if we ever heard one. Actually, we totally agree!” As the front man and guitarist for his previous band, White Tie Affair, Chris made a name for himself on the road, honing his performance and writing skills while touring with the likes of Lady Gaga and on sold-out Warped Tours across the country. As Chris embarks on his solo career he says he has a few guidelines for his new material. “The songs I write and release now all have to have three things that make up my ‘musical DNA’,” he states definitively. “They all have to be honest – I have to feel them. Second, they have to have a melody that moves me and third, they need to hit hard!” Chris is definitely true to these convictions from the start to finish of his debut solo album. The album’s first single, “Remember When (Push Rewind),” manages to embrace both pop world melancholy and a heavy beat, as Chris brings his vocal pyrotechnics to the forefront of what is sure to be his biggest hit to date. With over 50 Top 40 stations coming on board in only its first three weeks of release, the single is already generating rave reviews, with CBS Radio calling the song, “an explosion of raw energy, infectious hooks and emotional connection.” In talking about the track, Chris explains, “I was dating this girl when I was in my band who I really thought was the one. But as my musical career started taking off, it became clear that we were in different places, (“As my future got bright, we started losing light.”), and we eventually broke up. “’Remember When’ talks about that time when all you really want to do is go back, push rewind, and start all over again.” While Chris may be able to express his feelings in his music today, it wasn’t always easy for him. Growing up a bashful teenager in the small, tight-knit town of Hebron, Indiana, Chris didn’t always have places to channel his emotions. “There was this small town mentality where most of the guys I knew got their girlfriends pregnant at 18, 19, got married, and settled in for the long haul. It was just assumed I would follow right into my family’s cabinet design business. So, when I said I wanted to play music and do something different, it was much easier for people to put me down rather than be encouraging.” As a teen, Chris had bigger dreams. To channel his frustrations he began playing lead guitar in local bar bands before he eventually put together his own band, Quad Four. After that, there was no turning back. He added the role of lead vocalist soon after, explaining the transition by saying, “Once I got my first taste of being a front man I couldn’t go back to just playing guitar. I mean, it was actually a way to get paid for singing loud!” That loud and explosive voice worked to Chris’ advantage, yet again, when he posted a song on MySpace. And that one song was all it took. The track, “Allow Me To Introduce Myself…Mr. Right,” caught the ear of a New York record scout and Chris was soon signed to Epic Records, officially getting him out of Hebron and onto that larger, national stage he always wanted forming the band White Tie Affair. Chris’ band released their hugely successful, debut album, Walk This Way, and, over the next two years, he gained the reputation as one of the most explosive front men on Top 40 radio to back up the Top 20 Hit – Candle (Sick and Tired) that he had written. Within the band’s first year on the road, they were asked to perform with artists from all across the musical spectrum - from the Warped Tour to Cyndi Lauper’s True Colors Tour – playing alongside some of their childhood idols. However, it was on Lady Gaga’s Fame Ball Tour that Chris learned a valuable lesson that seemed expressed his own, personal philosophy on how he wanted to make it big in the music business. “I was talking to Lady Gaga backstage and we overheard Guns-N-Roses warming up. Now, here I am with Lady Gaga, a woman who’s already had three number one songs at the time, and we run behind a curtain, giggling like school kids, to watch Axl Rose rehearsing. After awhile she looks over and says to me, ‘That’s the secret to being a successful pop star. You have to be bigger than your songs.’ I totally got it!” Chris certainly lived up to those words when he released the song that really put his band on the map, the ubiquitous Top 20 smash, “Candle (Sick and Tired).” That song made its way into the public consciousness as an MTV, TRL staple and by its ever-present inclusion in the essential teen show of its day, “The Hills.” Add in heavy radio play and sold out shows across the country, and it looked like Chris’ childhood fantasies of hitting it big were finally coming true. But, he soon experienced that oft-told tale of the downsides to success, especially when it comes so fast. “My whole life totally changed overnight, but not in the way I thought it would. While I was finally getting the recognition I always dreamed of, for doing what I always wanted to do, the record company stepped in. They wanted us to write and record with who they thought were the ‘best’ producers and writers in the business instead of letting us make our own music. My gut has never been wrong and all of it started feeling wrong to me because there was nothing authentic about that. It wasn’t who I was. Right then, I realized that I didn’t want to be part of a big machine; I wanted to BE the machine. I guess I had some blind optimism that told me I could do it on my own terms.” Doing it on his own terms meant trusting his instincts and now, with his trademarked excitement and optimism. Chris was determined to do things his way through producing some of his own songs as well as working alongside friend and producer/writer Matt Radosevich (All American Rejects, 30 Seconds To Mars, Hot Chelle Rae, Good Charlotte). Together they have created a blend of pop, dance, rock, and electronic influences that “hit hard” and remain true to Chris’ musical convictions. “When I write a song it usually starts with a feeling and a mood that I wind up humming as a melody or singing some lyrics into my phone while I’m driving in my car.” (There’s that car again!) “Then I usually go into the studio and fool around with it on the guitar or a piano. My true test is whether what I wind up with has that same feeling that sparked the song originally. If not, I just keep working on it until it’s right.” Chris wrote the majority of his debut album at the legendary Village Studios in Los Angeles, where he seemed to gain more and more inspiration every day. “My studio was on the 3rd floor and I would walk past all these platinum and gold records on the wall on my way upstairs. There was one day where I walked in and I heard Weezer rehearsing in Studio A, Elton John recording piano and singing in Studio D, and then I high-fived John Mayer as he walks past me! There’s something so completely magical in those walls.” Chris drew from all aspects of his life when creating this album and on the song, “I’ll Be There,” he sums it all up. “In the past, I had been so obsessed trying to get my career going that I kinda lost site of what life and love were all about. “I’ll Be There” is my reminder that, when life gets crazy and everything seems to be going wrong, I have to remember to take a look around. At any given time there are so many people surrounding you who are willing to help. You gotta remember that life and all of its amazing treasures are worthless unless you have people to share it with.” The result of that awareness is a debut album that showcases the best of what Chris Wallace brings to the musical table. From the anthemic choruses of “Remember When (Push Rewind),” and “Keep Me Crazy,” to the Bill Withers’ throwback style of “Don’t Mind If I Do,” to the ‘I’m-taking-back-my-heart-from-that-girl-who-had-me-fucked-up-for-a-week’ defiance of “Hurricane,” Chris’ debut is proof positive that Chris is staying true to his vision as he sees his early dreams meet a superstar’s reality. Chris sums up his drive and determination to succeed in simple terms. “People may say I’m shooting for the stars, but at least I’m gonna shoot big. In my heart, I’m always going to be that guy in my car, singing my lungs out, trying to be heard over the radio.” -Chris Wallace on growing up in Hebron, Indiana One of the first things you learn about Chris Wallace is that he dreams BIG.

But as my musical career started taking off, it became clear that we were in different places, (“As my future got bright, we started losing light.”), and we eventually broke up. “’Remember When’ talks about that time when all you really want to do is go back, push rewind, and start all over again.”</p> <p>While Chris may be able to express his feelings in his music today, it wasn’t always easy for him. Growing up a bashful teenager in the small, tight-knit town of Hebron, Indiana, Chris didn’t always have places to channel his emotions. “There was this small town mentality where most of the guys I knew got their girlfriends pregnant at 18, 19, got married, and settled in for the long haul. It was just assumed I would follow right into my family’s cabinet design business. So, when I said I wanted to play music and do something different, it was much easier for people to put me down rather than be encouraging.”</p> <p>As a teen, Chris had bigger dreams. To channel his frustrations he began playing lead guitar in local bar bands before he eventually put together his own band, Quad Four. After that, there was no turning back. He added the role of lead vocalist soon after, explaining the transition by saying, “Once I got my first taste of being a front man I couldn’t go back to just playing guitar. I mean, it was actually a way to get paid for singing loud!”</p> <p>That loud and explosive voice worked to Chris’ advantage, yet again, when he posted a song on MySpace. And that one song was all it took. The track, “Allow Me To Introduce Myself…Mr. Right,” caught the ear of a New York record scout and Chris was soon signed to Epic Records, officially getting him out of Hebron and onto that larger, national stage he always wanted forming the band White Tie Affair.</p> <p>Chris’ band released their hugely successful, debut album, Walk This Way, and, over the next two years, he gained the reputation as one of the most explosive front men on Top 40 radio to back up the Top 20 Hit – Candle (Sick and Tired) that he had written. Within the band’s first year on the road, they were asked to perform with artists from all across the musical spectrum <del>- from the Warped Tour to Cyndi Lauper’s True Colors Tour –</del> playing alongside some of their childhood idols. However, it was on Lady Gaga’s Fame Ball Tour that Chris learned a valuable lesson that seemed expressed his own, personal philosophy on how he wanted to make it big in the music business. “I was talking to Lady Gaga backstage and we overheard Guns-N-Roses warming up. Now, here I am with Lady Gaga, a woman who’s already had three number one songs at the time, and we run behind a curtain, giggling like school kids, to watch Axl Rose rehearsing. After awhile she looks over and says to me, ‘That’s the secret to being a successful pop star. You have to be bigger than your songs.’ I totally got it!”</p> <p>Chris certainly lived up to those words when he released the song that really put his band on the map, the ubiquitous Top 15 smash, “Candle (Sick and Tired).” That song made its way into the public consciousness as an <span class=""caps"">MTV</span>, <span class=""caps"">TRL</span> staple and by its ever-present inclusion in the essential teen show of its day, “The Hills.” Add in heavy radio play and sold out shows across the country, and it looked like Chris’ childhood fantasies of hitting it big were finally coming true. But, he soon experienced that oft-told tale of the downsides to success, especially when it comes so fast.</p> <p>“My whole life totally changed overnight, but not in the way I thought it would. While I was finally getting the recognition I always dreamed of, for doing what I always wanted to do, the record company stepped in. They wanted us to write and record with who they thought were the ‘best’ producers and writers in the business instead of letting us make our own music. My gut has never been wrong and all of it started feeling wrong to me because there was nothing authentic about that. It wasn’t who I was. Right then, I realized that I didn’t want to be part of a big machine; I wanted to BE the machine. I guess I had some blind optimism that told me I could do it on my own terms.”</p> <p>Doing it on his own terms meant trusting his instincts and now, with his trademarked excitement and optimism. Chris was determined to do things his way through producing some of his own songs as well as working alongside friend and producer/writer Matt Radosevich (All American Rejects, 30 Seconds To Mars, Hot Chelle Rae, Good Charlotte). Together they have created a blend of pop, dance, rock, and electronic influences that “hit hard” and remain true to Chris’ musical convictions.</p> <p>“When I write a song it usually starts with a feeling and a mood that I wind up humming as a melody or singing some lyrics into my phone while I’m driving in my car.” (There’s that car again!) “Then I usually go into the studio and fool around with it on the guitar or a piano. My true test is whether what I wind up with has that same feeling that sparked the song originally. If not, I just keep working on it until it’s right.”</p> <p>Chris wrote the majority of his debut album at the legendary Village Studios in Los Angeles, where he seemed to gain more and more inspiration every day. “My studio was on the 3rd floor and I would walk past all these platinum and gold records on the wall on my way upstairs. There was one day where I walked in and I heard Weezer rehearsing in Studio A, Elton John recording piano and singing in Studio D, and then I high-fived John Mayer as he walks past me! There’s something so completely magical in those walls.”</p> <p>Chris drew from all aspects of his life when creating this album and on the song, “I’ll Be There,” he sums it all up. “In the past, I had been so obsessed trying to get my career going that I kinda lost site of what life and love were all about. “I’ll Be There” is my reminder that, when life gets crazy and everything seems to be going wrong, I have to remember to take a look around. At any given time there are so many people surrounding you who are willing to help. You gotta remember that life and all of its amazing treasures are worthless unless you have people to share it with.”</p> <p>The result of that awareness is a debut album that showcases the best of what Chris Wallace brings to the musical table. From the anthemic choruses of “Remember When (Push Rewind),” and “Keep Me Crazy,” to the Bill Withers’ throwback style of “Don’t Mind If I Do,” to the ‘I’m-taking-back-my-heart-from-that-girl-who-had-me-fucked-up-for-a-week’ defiance of “Hurricane,” Chris’ debut is proof positive that Chris is staying true to his vision as he sees his early dreams meet a superstar’s reality.</p> <p>Chris sums up his drive and determination to succeed in simple terms. “People may say I’m shooting for the stars, but at least I’m gonna shoot big. In my heart, I’m always going to be that guy in my car, singing my lungs out, trying to be heard over the radio.”</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7467509/5d58cb91099d4a794f174aa31a9f4160_poster.png","http://www.youtube.com/e/KoBQWLE11NA?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

Glimpses of hardcore, post hardcore, and pop find the band in a new rock genre: melodicore. Simplistic Urge, formed in ’03, is made up of five members: Tim Flynn – Lead Vocalist Matty – Guitar and backup vocalist Michael Styrczula – Guitar and backup vocalist John Haracz – Bassist Chris DiDomenico – Percussion While immersed in the Chicago music scene, SU has played well-known venues such as The Double Door, The Elbo Room, The Congress Theatre, and the Lakeshore Theatre. The band is also well known at The Rave in Milwaukee, WI. SU participated in Bodog’s “In the Trenches” Music Competition, a national battle of the bands. They advanced to the second round of competition and gained more respect on the scene. SU also returned to Chicago’s House of Blues for their second appearance in Al Roker Jr’s XXXL bash with Bellevue Suite and El Guapo. The pinnacle of ’06 for Simplistic Urge was taking The Metro by storm during their performance at Songs from a Scene VI with Lucky Boys Confusion. Simplistic Urge has played with nationally renowned artists such as Letter Kills, Chevelle, StutterFly, Adair, and Collective Soul, as well as being chosen by Q101, Chicago’s largest alternative station, to compete in their Local Music Mail Room. Here listeners voted online for the best local band. SU won by over 40%, winning air time on the radio station for their single “One Sided.” SU was nominated as one of the finalists during Suburban Nightlife’s Best of the ‘Burbs competition. The band was also featured in a spread in the December ’06 edition of Clubline Magazine. In the summer of ’05, Simplistic Urge traveled to Malibu, CA to record Eight Sided Di. With ’06 came SU’s next EP Pulse of America. ’07 finds the band in another stage of evolution. Hardcore and pop clash head on to create SU’s newest sound: the EP Bridging the Gap. Two new recordings are on the way, as well as new merchandise and new venues to play. Simplistic Urge has just finished recording their new EP ""Drown In Your Own Demise"" with producer Steve Russell (As I Lay Dying, Sworn Enemy, Blindside, etc…) It was released Summer 2007.

Not wanting to get stuck in a niche, the resulting music can be called straight ahead American rock ‘n’ roll.

With creative songwriting, anchored by strong hooks and accented by plenty of guitar solos (somewhat of a lost art these days), there is something that any listener can appreciate in their songs. Consisting of members from some well-known Milwaukee bands, DANGERFIELD is led by Carlyle Nowak on vocals and lead guitar. Already an accomplished drummer (Heart of a Failure and WAMI award winning Blue Background), Carlyle has stepped out from behind the drums to front the band. In his place behind the kit is Ryan Igielski (Big Dumb Dick and Deflection), providing solid, powerful drums. Completing the band is a pair of brothers, making their second go-around in a band together. Joe Fuerst (Ka-tet) is an experienced guitar player. Essentially a second lead, Joe’s rhythm playing is a perfect compliment to Carlyle’s guitar work. Bringing the low end is James Fuerst (Ka-tet, Sore) on bass. With technical prowess and a 6-string bass, James brings just the right amount of funk to the table. DANGERFIELD really shines the most when on stage.

She is an independent spirit and a songwriter who shuns the confinement of “pigeon holes.” Her sultry voice can caress you with a feather or slap you with a bullwhip. Are you ready? Hold on tight for a fantastic ride… “Growing up I had an AM radio attached to my ear,” explains Penny Jo Pullus of the latest chapters in her musical explorations. “I slept with it under my pillow. I am also the youngest of four siblings so whatever my brother and sisters were listening to, I soaked up like a sponge.” It’s been 10 years since this firecracker, who led the Alt. Country band Penny Jo’s Trailer Trash in Northern N.Y., defected South with two “Sammy’s” – Best new artist of 1994 and Best Roots Rock Group of 1995 – tucked under her arm. She blew through Nashville and left it in her rear view mirror bypassing its high gloss and rigidity and headed for the musically eclectic and traditionally organic Austin, Texas. Here she has been honing her songwriting craft and assembling her biting and twang influenced band, The Vanishing Breed. “We have more teeth than fur,” she grins. I am not looking to be a retro-country museum piece. Similar to Roseanne Cash and Lucinda Williams, Pullus has dug deeper to find the right songs and voice of a mature song writer, to shake off the “country chick singer stamp.” It is clear that she is showing a new and different side of Penny Jo. What she is now up to is decidedly different. She has combined a roots sound with the right pop influences due to Producer Ron Flynt (20/20) to develop a unique style that has her inspired as well as singing at her best. She has charted admirably on the Americana Music Chart, Progressive Country Charts and various European charts with her last two musical efforts Lucky #7 and My Turn to Howl. Underdogs is slated to debut in 2007 with the host of regular suspects, Ron Flynt, Scrappy Jud, Eric Hisaw and Ian Maclagan. “Ever since I decided that this is what I wanted to do with my life, it’s been about gut feelings, about doing what I like to do, finding my own way of being me,” Penny Jo concludes. And from her brother’s record collection to the clubs of Austin, the Penny Jo Pullus we get to know on stage is someone who’s not only well worth knowing – but someone who’s found what she’s looking for.","<p>Penny Jo Pullus has been kickin’ up her boot heels coast to coast around America and Europe.

The same year she could be heard putting down the melancholic and yearning vocals for the highly acclaimed producer and DJ Trentemøller. Together with her good friend and colleague, Josephine Philip, Trolle created a unique and playful universe under the name of JaConfetti. Her latest musical output includes her role in the trio, Balstyrko, alongside Blæs Bukki, and Ormen, creating some of the most interesting Danish music to hit the national charts. Not only has Ane been able to cross over to a larger and more mainstream Danish audience – despite her often quite uncompromising take on musical subgenres – she’s also experienced some significant success abroad. In particular, collaborations with both Siebenhaar and Trentemøller have generated international recognition – notably hitting the charts in Germany and France with the Trolle//Siebenhaar-single Sweet Dogs. Not to forget her crucial vocal feature on Trentemøller’s massive electronica hit, Moan. Prior to her involvement in the these collaborations, Ane Trolle was a frequent act in the Danish underground, best known for her ability to jump onstage at any request and blow the audience away with an immediate outburst of improvised lyricism and melody. Present Working closely with producer and musician, Peter Leth (The Crooked Spoke, Junior Senior (live)), Trolle has gathered all her experiences from previous collaborations under one roof. Now we find her ready to release her debut album as a solo artist. The material for the album, Honest Wall, has come about after several years of travelling to remote and exotic destinations, such as Rwanda, USA and Haiti, hooking up with a vast variety of authentic and enthusiastic people, all sharing their own inspiring stories. Subsequently, she would spend endless nights in the studio and in her home – a cosy wooden cottage not far from the centre of Copenhagen – processing the ideas and impressions from these adventures. Honest Wall is a compressed distillate of Trolle’s eclectic experiences and wide-ranging universe, personally as well as musically. It bears witness to her constant curiosity and reluctance towards monotony. In Ane’s own words “it would feel wrong to make a streamlined album. It has to be a wide variety of moods, colours and sounds to righteously portray my inner self.” The lyrical spectrum found on Honest Wall reflects the diverse nature of the music. The songs are rooted in Ane’s desire to portray close relationships, and the feelings that accompany them. The song Remedy deals with ambivalence; the often difficult and yet warm family relations. Lost and unresolved love is a central theme in both Ribbon Arms and Algae & Bottles, whereas the title track is a sincere celebration of art, creativity and playfulness. According to Ane Trolle Honest Wall is about “Passion, curiosity and the importance of letting this passion be the key factor in life”.","<p>The Past<br /> Gifted with a natural musical talent, her rough and vivid voice has taken Ane Trolle far within the Danish music scene, and with a rare ability to engage in an array of creative ventures, Trolle has managed to become one the most recognized female artists in Denmark.</p> <p>2006 found her bursting out of our radios with sweet treats of honey-drippin’ reggae-pop in the company of Danish rapper/producer, Pato, as the duo Trolle // Siebenhaar.

Warren grew up on Long Island, New York with his mother and brothers traveling back and forth until finally settling down in Elmont, then Floral Park. Warren went to school at Stewart Manor Elementary and is going to graduate at Sewanhaka High School in June 2009. Warren was never one to be interested into music, in fact , he wanted to have several different occupations before thinking about becoming a music artist. What got Warren interested into music as a career was his an event that occurred at his friend’s birthday party which took place on November 20 2003. A freestyle competition was held in which the winner was to receive money as a prize. Warren figured he and his best friend Joe go up on the stage and split the prize money in what would seem as a “win,win” situation. Once on stage, the two battled each other hoping to get some money and along the way, notoriety. Unfortunately for Warren, that experience would be one to remember forever! As Joe finished reciting his verse, Warren was hoping to hear his name announced as the winner for the competition, but instead the crowd had other plans in mind. “Booooooooooooo” as the crowd roared the sound of a loud boo that would echo in Warren’s mind like a repetitive chant. From that day forward, he vowed to prove everyone wrong, everyone that doubted him, he vowed to show them that anything can be achieved once you put your mind to it. At first it was a challenging task writing songs let alone verses , but as time progressed on, it seemed to come natural as soon as a beat was played. Currently, Warren resides in Floral Park with his family and is working hard as an unsigned artist to promote his music. Warren Wint plans on making his mark in the music scene as not only an independent artist who is willing to do anything and everything to achieve his dreams, but as a person to be remembered forever.

It all began when Puff was young dude raised by his mother, a college graduate, and his father, a part time super dad and street hustler. Puff has seen everything growing up, but at this part of Puff’s life the only things that were important were video games, football and rap. One day Puff’s house was kicked in by the ATF. Everything in Puff’s life changed for the worst after that. His family was homeless and had to stay with grandparents. Puff had to take care of his family. Puff took up the family trade and started hustling. A year later Puff’s best friend was killed. That woke Puff up to put more energy into something positive. In 2006 West Coast legend, Mack 10, signed Ruka to his label, Hoo- Bangin, after seeing him perform at a club in St. Louis. The rapper bought two of Ruka’s songs even one for using for his first single, “Like This” with Nate Dogg. The song was a product placement phenomenon! It was used for NFL games, movies ( Waist Deep starring Tyrese), The Soprano’s, and tons of other TV and radio commercials. Rukapuff’s music has also been featured in other areas of the entertainment field as well. Puff had the official World Series championship song and video for the St. Louis Cardinals. “Brimmy” debuted on Fox Sports Midwest during the Cardinals pennant run. The staff at Fox were so pleased with the first project they asked Ruka to do another song and video for the Indiana Pacers home games. Currently Rukapuff is a household name in the Midwest just awaiting his turn to breakthrough worldwide. Ruka is definitely one of the most diverse and complete artist in the game today. This promoter, entertainer, songwriter, humanitarian, and parent is a mogul in the making and is the definition of grind.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/john-wayne-bro","John Wayne Bro","Los Angeles/Motor City/Southern Swamps","","JOHN WAYNE BRO started out with a name. In 2010 while chasing the dream in Hollywood, Taylor Bro and Sam Levi, future founders of JOHN WAYNE BRO, were working together on a film set discussing music – their true passion. They found common ground in influences ranging from Robert Johnson and Junior Kimbrough, to Dr. Dre’s “The Chronic,” and the Parliament Funkadelic. The conversation eventually turned to “good band names.” Upon hearing that future drummer Taylor Bro’s father’s real name was “John Wayne Bro,” co-founder Sam Levi knew that they needed to start a band, that day, with that name. The boys knew the band’s music had to be as gritty and as Americana as the JOHN WAYNE BRO name, and so they set out on their journey… Renting a hot, crowded rehearsal space overlooking downtown Los Angeles to bang out their gritty style of American blues rock, they spent the next year crafting tunes written for the American working man and intent on bringing danger back to rock & roll. The music of JOHN WAYNE BRO is a constant homage to the band members’ upbringings and musical influences, with lyrics covering topics of love and loss, hard living, Detroit assembly lines, and murdering bible salesmen. All the while, the underlying funk, hip-hop, and hard rock influences of JOHN WAYNE BRO’s songs always end up enticing stiletto-ed party girls to dance the night away during one of their live shows. JOHN WAYNE BRO recorded their debut album completely DIY style – they built a studio in a garage in Long Beach, and mixed, recorded, and played each song as a 2-piece. The resulting full-length album, “Man of the People”, was released March 15th, 2011 on www.johnwaynebro.com to coincide with a trip to Austin, TX & SXSW where Sam and Taylor went to promote, network, and play a few shows, all with popular success. As drummer, Taylor Bro, explains, “the album sounds as if Howlin’ Wolf, The Rolling Stones, The Black Keys and Tom Waits hopped into a Cadillac and drove 95mph into a head-on collision with MC5 and the Stooges behind the wheel of a Chevy Camaro.” JOHN WAYNE BRO is now hell bent on being internationally known and locally accepted. They have been playing live in LA, San Diego, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Long Beach, San Antonio, Austin, and San Francisco, winning over fans one at a time. JOHN WAYNE BRO is finding great success with their newly crafted live show that now includes Justin Charbonnet on guitar & Brad Stanfield on bass. The resulting sounds are truly full and give proper justice to the recorded efforts of “Man of the People”. You can purchase the album and find information about shows, video clips, and new songs at www.johnwaynebro.com.

She recently released her first EP called Rocketship Girl (http://gracelondon.bandcamp.com/). Grace started loving music when she was about one and a half after watching the Wizard of Oz for the first time. She fell in love with it and watched it obsessively until she had memorized all of the songs.When Grace was seven, she started taking classical guitar lessons, but she really started having fun when she would sing and play songs she liked listening to at the time. Grace started playing shows around Austin at coffee shops and fundraisers and parties at nine, and hasn’t stopped since! Behind all this passion for music, Grace is also driven to use her music to do good! Already throughout her young career, Grace’s performances have been dominated by the theme of using her music to help others, support numerous charities, and raised over $35,000 to help fight extreme poverty in Africa. Last year, Grace supported the GLSEN – National Safe Schools Program with her former band Residual Kid when they chose to donate all proceeds of the song “Can’t Take Me Away” to the organization. The song, which Grace penned, was featured on the ABC show “20/20” in October of 2011. In 2010, she used her music to help others when she “donated” her birthday as a chance to hold a charity concert to raise money for a water well in Ethiopia. In 2011, she again took the stage to help those in Ethiopia. This time she was lending her support to A Glimmer of Hope as they raised money for famine relief efforts and to build a new health clinic. Grace’s musical campaigns for Glimmer raised more than $25,000. When I write songs, words spill out that really don’t make sense at all,"" she says, “but when I look at it afterwards, it means something to me and I understand what I was saying when I wrote it!” Grace knows exactly who she is and her music and the way she uses it to help others is a strong reflection of what she values. Now, with her first EP release under her belt, she continues to write more songs and to grow as an artist while making sure that she helps make the world a better place for others in need.","<p><span><span class=""wysiwyg-color-red""><b><span class=""caps"">SXSW</span> 2013 <span class=""caps"">OFFICIAL</span> <span class=""caps"">SHOWCASE</span> <span class=""caps"">SELECTION</span></b></span><br><br>Grace London is a 13-year-old singer/songwriter, currently living in Los Angeles, CA.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-bare-feat","The Bare Feat","Austin,Tx","","Prepare yourself….. there’s a LOT of history in this thing… The Bare Feat has actually taken many years to develop into what it is today. The band’s founding members are Jacob Ruegg and Nick Hamner. They started playing music together in the seventh grade, although have known each other since the first grade. After a few months Lang Anderson (also a friend of both nick and Jacob since the first grade) began to play keys with them at that time in the band with Nick on drums, Jacob on guitar, and Lang on keys. They began their dream of making it big some day! The next year a friend that Nick met in orchestra by the name of Charlie Deschodt joined the band as the bass player. Getting started was hard because we never learned any covers due to the fact that we were determined to write original music. The summer before the guys would hit high school, Lang and Nick decided to attend the Natural Ear Music Camp and were put in a band with Mikah Pace, who after their session at the camp would become their back up guitarist. Nick and Jacob began to be unhappy with the band’s progress over the next two years so they began to have more practices a week. These practices would take place at Taylor Anderson’s house. The band had met Taylor in the eighth grade and he had become a good friend of all the members and soon joined them to play baritone. As the summer came too an end, High School began and the band didn’t meet very often if at all. Though Nick and Jacob still wrote music together, during that year Mikah quit the band because he just didn’t have enough time anymore. Though as Mikah left the band two new members were added: Ryder Turner and Mazen Khawaja. Ryder was added to the horn section to join Taylor and Mazen would replace Nick as the drummer and Nick moved to bass (which he had been learning on the side). Sadly at the end of the year Mazen moved, leaving the band without a drummer. It wasn’t until the band’s second year in High School that they began to pick up again. Though their good friend Taylor had to quit the band because of a lack of time to commit (Taylor still works with the band as a finance advisor), Myles Miller (Nick met him in orchestra) began to play with the band and moved Jacob to sax (which Jacob had played since the 5th grade and in the eighth grade got best solo in his jazz band). The same week that Myles joined the band, they recruited bass player Jacob Hope, moving Nick back to his original role as drummer. Things were going well once again. The band had practices as often as they could, though there still remained a problem. There was no vocalist. This is were Mason Ables came in. Mason was a good friend of Jacob Hope and shortly after Mason joined, another singer was added, Luz Zamora. Then we decided to beef up the horn section with Logan Bartlett on trumpet (whom nick and lang had played basketball with in earlier years) and baritone player Ore Afolayan…..add that all up and you’ll get the nine piece, funky rock band, The Bare Feat.","<p>Prepare yourself….. there’s a <span class=""caps"">LOT</span> of history in this thing…</p> <p>The Bare Feat has actually taken many years to develop into what it is today.

During the summer of 2011 the duo finally settled on what they wanted to present themselves as and what the soul purpose of the band was: “To create something new without any boundaries or limitations, and to do everything ourselves.”, states Matthew Breaux.

In December 2011, Naybor’s Basement released their debut studio album entitled “FIrst Steps.” It has sold particularly well considering the short amount of time it has been out and for the size of their group. “People love hearing us live, but haven’t had the time to get to know the songs, so we didn’t want to put off recording this album. Now everyone can hear the music in good quality and know the music for the shows.”, said the band.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/e-dubble","e-dubble","Philadelphia","","Growing up in the suburbs of Philadelphia e-dubble gained his first appreciation for music from his singing, guitar playing father. Weaving vivid narratives with sing-along choruses, classic melodies and driving rhythms, his father’s songs were influential in e-dubble’s future artistic endeavors. Being the youngest in a household full of music, e-dubble had exposure to a variety of genres from memorizing Paul Simon’s “Graceland” with his father, to stealing his sister’s Snoop Doggy Dogg’s Doggystyle tape, e-dubble quickly gained a flavor for the eclectic. Recording songs straight from the radio onto his fisher price boombox’s tape deck- his mixtapes sampled hits spanning artists from Tribe Called Quest, to Bruce Springsteen, to Nirvana, to Dr. Dre. It was around this time that e-dubble’s penchant for rap music, a genre still in its formative years, began to grow. Courtesy of his substantial stature and creativity he was able to work around the freshly adopted parental advisory sticker program, and take advantage of loop-holes within the cd-a-month mailer system; allowing him to build an impressive collection of his favorite rap music. Artists such as Warren G, Wu-Tang Clan and Notorious B.I.G. funneled through his headphones each night, providing an escape from the mundane world of homework. The array of musical influences from his childhood molded him as a truthful, independent artist; with a cognitive, lyrical style of awareness and a progressive instrumental sound. e-dubble started crafting his unique sound and lyrical style when he began attending St. Mary’s College of Maryland where he met future band mate Skeltz. What started off as two friends making beats, and mixing “power hour” tapes quickly materialized into a long portfolio of tracks. In 2002 Skeltz introduced e-dub to some of his musically inclined high school friends from Baltimore. Tup, Stubbs and Glaze who were attending University of Maryland; and Peter Muth at Wheeling Jesuit University. The six friends began producing songs, ranging from rap to rock to country, and in looking for an easy format to exchange their new creations formed the website Irishtoothache.com in 2003. The popularity of the makeshift group resulted in several successful college shows and opening performances for signed artists. Upon graduation from college e-dubble took the summer off, moved in with his gracious parents and took to the basement, creating his first official mixtape entitled “Straight Outta St. Mary’s.” It was well received among friends, family and fans but upon completion e-dubble knew it was time to get ready for the real world. e-dubble moved to Northern Liberties, Philadelphia, then settled on a house in neighboring Fishtown and continued work on his music. Over the next two years e-dubble held a number of jobs, including Minor A.R. for a now defunct record label. He quickly learned some of the ills of the record industry, which lessened the blow when the company went bust in April 2008. e-dubble saw the lay-off as an opportunity, and in June of 2008 moved to Baltimore to live with his friends and irishtoothache collaborators… Together they formed the popular Baltimore hip-hop band Young English, and played their first show in July of 2008. The group went on to purchase a beautifully renovated warehouse, aptly dubbed “The Hampden Mansion,” where e-dubble would later go on to write, record, and produce his debut album hip-hop is good. Today the group spends much of its time converting the 6,000 squarefoot, historic landmark into a full music and video production studio, with the full length Young English LP slated as their first project.","<p>Growing up in the suburbs of Philadelphia e-dubble gained his first appreciation for music from his singing, guitar playing father.

Being the youngest in a household full of music, e-dubble had exposure to a variety of genres from memorizing Paul Simon’s “Graceland” with his father, to stealing his sister’s Snoop Doggy Dogg’s Doggystyle tape, e-dubble quickly gained a flavor for the eclectic.</p> <p>Recording songs straight from the radio onto his fisher price boombox’s tape deck- his mixtapes sampled hits spanning artists from Tribe Called Quest, to Bruce Springsteen, to Nirvana, to Dr. Dre. It was around this time that e-dubble’s penchant for rap music, a genre still in its formative years, began to grow. Courtesy of his substantial stature and creativity he was able to work around the freshly adopted parental advisory sticker program, and take advantage of loop-holes within the cd-a-month mailer system; allowing him to build an impressive collection of his favorite rap music. Artists such as Warren G, Wu-Tang Clan and Notorious B.I.G. funneled through his headphones each night, providing an escape from the mundane world of homework. The array of musical influences from his childhood molded him as a truthful, independent artist; with a cognitive, lyrical style of awareness and a progressive instrumental sound.</p> <p>e-dubble started crafting his unique sound and lyrical style when he began attending St. Mary’s College of Maryland where he met future band mate Skeltz. What started off as two friends making beats, and mixing “power hour” tapes quickly materialized into a long portfolio of tracks. In 2002 Skeltz introduced e-dub to some of his musically inclined high school friends from Baltimore. Tup, Stubbs and Glaze who were attending University of Maryland; and Peter Muth at Wheeling Jesuit University. The six friends began producing songs, ranging from rap to rock to country, and in looking for an easy format to exchange their new creations formed the website Irishtoothache.com in 2003. The popularity of the makeshift group resulted in several successful college shows and opening performances for signed artists.</p> <p>Upon graduation from college e-dubble took the summer off, moved in with his gracious parents and took to the basement, creating his first official mixtape entitled “Straight Outta St. Mary’s.” It was well received among friends, family and fans but upon completion e-dubble knew it was time to get ready for the real world. e-dubble moved to Northern Liberties, Philadelphia, then settled on a house in neighboring Fishtown and continued work on his music. Over the next two years e-dubble held a number of jobs, including Minor A.R. for a now defunct record label. He quickly learned some of the ills of the record industry, which lessened the blow when the company went bust in April 2008.</p> <p>e-dubble saw the lay-off as an opportunity, and in June of 2008 moved to Baltimore to live with his friends and irishtoothache collaborators… Together they formed the popular Baltimore hip-hop band Young English, and played their first show in July of 2008. The group went on to purchase a beautifully renovated warehouse, aptly dubbed “The Hampden Mansion,” where e-dubble would later go on to write, record, and produce his debut album hip-hop is good.</p> <p>Today the group spends much of its time converting the 6,000 squarefoot, historic landmark into a full music and video production studio, with the full length Young English LP slated as their first project.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/5342797/9c8821ed64421da9b1a9b47310c5c5c7_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/_tdU4SzyOks?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

He first fell in love with the music of the Beatles and Elvis Presley at the age of eight, and over the next decade became enamored and influenced by the songs of Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones and the Ramones, along with more current bands such as Green Day and the White Stripes. When he was 17, he entered the local music scene, fronting several Cleveland-based rock acts. In college, Dan’s musical journey found him sharing the bill with a wide variety of acts such as Blackalicious, Wiz Khalifa, The Cool Kids, the Fiery Furnaces and even, Wang Chung. Upon graduating from the College of Wooster in 2009, Dan began working with award-winning producer, Jim McKell. The result was Dan’s highly-praised solo debut, Thirsty. In 2010, he put together his live backing band, the Albino Winos, made up of long-time friend and drummer, Sarah Luffred, guitarist Alex Bowers, and bassist Joe LaGuardia. Dan and the Albino Winos soon began promoting Thirsty with their high-energy rock show. In the summer of 2010, Dan recorded and released his EP, Tease. The songs “Tease” and “Lucinda” received radio play in stations from Boston to Cleveland, while “The Holy Roller Stone Revival” became a finalist for the best rock song in the John Lennon Songwriting Competition. In 2011, Dan again teamed up with Jim McKell to record another EP, Rock N Roll Band!, cut in Atlanta, Georgia with the help of his live band. The band celebrated the release of the album with a triumphant packed hometown concert at the House of Blues Cambridge Room and an east coast tour taking them through NYC, Boston, Baltimore, DC and Harrisburg. Frequently performing throughout the Midwest, Dan toured the southeast this March, performing in Georgia and Florida. A new album, Sugar & Adrenaline, has been completed and will be released this summer. Winning new fans with each show, Dan is very optimistic about the future!","<p>Dan Miraldi is a rock and roll singer and songwriter from Cleveland, Ohio.

Born in Chicago and growing up in Boston, Williams began studies with master drummer Alan Dawson at an early age and began playing professionally at the age of 13 with saxophonist Sam Rivers. Jackie McLean hired Williams at 16. Then at 17, Williams found considerable fame with Miles Davis, joining a group that was later dubbed Davis’s ""Second Great Quintet."" Williams was a vital element of the group, called by Davis in his autobiography ""the center of the group’s sound"". His inventive playing helped redefine the role of jazz rhythm section through the use of polyrhythms and metric modulation (transitioning between mathematically related tempos and/or time signatures). But perhaps his overarching achievement was in demonstrating, through his playing, that the drummer need not be relegated to timekeeping and accompaniment in a jazz ensemble; that the drummer may be free to contribute to the performance as an equal partner in the improvisation. In 1969, he formed a trio, The Tony Williams Lifetime (with John McLaughlin on guitar and Larry Young on organ). It was a pioneering band of the fusion movement, a combination of rock, R&B, and jazz. Their first album, Emergency!, is considered a classic. Unfortunately, the band was not a commercial success, and after McLaughlin’s departure, and several more albums, the group disbanded. In 1975, Williams put together a band he called ‘The New Tony Williams Lifetime’, featuring bassist Tony Newton, pianist Alan Pasqua, and English guitarist Allan Holdsworth, which recorded two albums for Columbia Records (Believe It and Million Dollar Legs respectively). In mid 1976, Williams was a part of a reunion of sorts with his old Miles Davis band compatriots, pianist/keyboardist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter and tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter. Miles backed out of the reunion at the last minute and was replaced by Freddie Hubbard. The record was later released as V.S.O.P. (which stood for a ""Very Special OneTime Performance"" and was highly instrumental in bringing back acoustical jazz. In 1985, Williams recorded an album for Blue Note Records entitled Foreign Intrigue, which featured the playing of pianist Mulgrew Miller and trumpeter Wallace Roney. Later that year, he formed a quintet with Miller and Roney, which also featured tenor and soprano saxophonist Bill Pierce and bassist Charnett Moffett (later Ira Coleman). This band played Williams’ compositions almost exclusively (the Lennon/McCartney song ""Blackbird"", the standard ""Poinciana"", and the Freddie Hubbard blues ""Birdlike"" being the exceptions) and toured and recorded throughout the remainder of the ’80s, into the early ’90s. This rhythm section also recorded as a trio. Williams lived and taught in the San Francisco Bay Area until his death from a heart attack following routine gall bladder surgery.

Following the successful release of the band’s 2008 debut Album, which featured collaboration with legendary keyboardist Bernie Worrell (Parliament/Funkadelic and The Talking Heads) the band has now set their sights on a heavily awaited sophomore album.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/distant-lights","Distant Lights","Austin, TX","","Austin’s Distant Lights combine complex instrumentation and masterful vocals and lyricism into a powerful, modern rock sound. While the group has been favorably compared to the likes of A Perfect Circle, Radiohead, or Muse they are unquestionably unique. Distant Lights toe the line between rock and performance art, pop and metal, serenity and a storm. Currently in the studio recording their 2nd album, Distant Lights’ momentum continues to accelerate as their musical exploration has drawn increasing attention. After landing a finalist spot in last years Hard Rock Battle of the Bands they went on to win the 2010 Austin Chronicle Sound Wars competition. They’ve been featured numerous times in Houston’s 94.5 Buzz FM showcases, with airplay of the single “Heart of Fire”. After playing together for only a year, Distant Lights released their critically acclaimed debut album, Simulacrum, in March 2008. The momentum of the album and a subsequent 16-city east coast tour vaulted the group into the playlists of over 200 radio stations nationwide, licensing agreements, exclusive representation at the 2009 NACA Convention and opportunities to perform from coast to coast. Intelligence and curiosity inspire Distant Lights to push the boundaries that separate auditory and visual perception and prompt them to question their surrounding world. 2008’s concept album Simulacrum, the group’s debut, utilized Plato’s Allegory of the Cave as a metaphor for the dismal state of current affairs. During select performances, projections of artwork and video accompany each track, creating an astonishing visual manifestation of each song. The band also employs a homemade music visualizer which allows the audience to literally watch the music they are hearing through projected vibrations of water. Cymatics, as the science is known, is the study of visible sound and vibration. While the study was first acknowledged to exist by Galileo, Distant Lights stands at the forefront of applying this amazing natural occurrence to rock music. The group has begun work on a collaborative effort with scientist Richard Merrick, author of Interference: A Grand Scientific Musical Theory. While still in the works, the educational endeavor plans to combine an explanation of harmonic interference theory through live performances and lectures. Such presentation, combined with the force of Distant Lights’ sound, offers the audience something far beyond the normal concert experience.","<p>Austin’s Distant Lights combine complex instrumentation and masterful vocals and lyricism into a powerful, modern rock sound.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/justine-dorsey","Justine Dorsey","Southern California","","Hi. I’m Justine. I am sitting in my bedroom, writing this on a very hot August afternoon. Last week I turned sixteen. It’s really kind of baffling. Not to sound like your crazy aunt you see once a year at those slightly cheesy family reunions, but I feel like it wasn’t that long ago that I was a little girl chasing away seagulls on the beach. Actually, I still do that from time to time. So. I started singing when I was five, and I just loved it. Broadway musicals were my thing- you’d always hear me belting out songs from Annie or Wicked or something like that. When I was twelve or thirteen, I started learning guitar. I remember looking for something in our garage one day, when I came across the most beat up guitar case. It was really thrashed- the stitching was unraveling and all that. I opened it up and found the most beautiful guitar inside. It had a picture of a girl leaning over a circle of dancing fairies and sprites, her face lit up from their glow. It was one of the most magical things I’d ever seen. I didn’t know then that my mom would ask me if I wanted to take guitar lessons, and that I’d start the next week. Or that she’d come to me with an article about this girl named Taylor Swift and tell me that she thought I could maybe write music too. And I certainly didn’t know that, the next day, just three months after starting to learn guitar, that I would’ve written my first song. I love writing music. It’s this special little world I can turn to when I am frustrated or sad or ridiculously happy. If I don’t know what to do about a certain situation, writing a song can help me solve my problem… Or at least clear my head a little. Along with that, I love acting, nature, dancing in the sand on the beach, laughing with my friends and family, and reading. I am a Harry Potter superfan (represent!) and I have a bit of a crush on Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye. (It’s a shame he doesn’t exist.) Life feels a little like Wonderland to me sometimes- everything’s terribly confusing and unpredictable and a little bit scary. But it’s also beautiful and whimsical, and there are always new things to be discovered about your environment and yourself. I don’t know how to end all this except to say thank you. For reading this. For supporting me. Maybe we’ll meet each other someday. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have songs to write and some seagulls to go chase. ;) Xoxo, Justine","<p>Hi.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-jim-ivins-band","The Jim Ivins Band","Richmond, VA","","Richmond, VA pop rockers The Jim Ivins Band ring in 2012 with their new EP Everything We Wanted, the follow up to their 2009 Ace Enders-produced self-titled set. Produced by fellow Richmond native Pedro Aida (The Riot Before, Ann Berretta, Carbon Leaf), Ivins & co. have expanded their pop rock sound, from the delicate acoustics of love song “Rollercoaster” to the frenetic rock of “Emergency” and the sexy syncopation of “Lost My Mind.” Inspired by a recent show opening for rock radio favorites Switchfoot and The Airborne Toxic Event, Ivins decided to look farther inward when writing for Everything We Wanted, crafting a record soaked in introspection while touching on a myriad of emotions and situations like addiction (‘The Sight Of Fire’), sex (‘Lost My Mind’) and moving forward after experiencing tragedy (‘Everything We Wanted’)."" “With half the songs having first versions written when I was 18, this record, to me, represents coming full circle and acknowledging the past while using it to shape where you’re going. It starts with the naiveté of when you’re 18 and think you have it all figured out when you really don’t have a clue, and then cycles to me now at 23 where I’m far from having it all figured out, but was compelled to go deeper and write about other things in life besides relationships.” In addition to brand new material, the band, which features its namesake Jim Ivins (lead vocals/guitar), his older brother Jack (drums) and friends Bobby Gary (bass) and Drew Martin (guitar/vocals), has updated three songs (“Run,” “Rollercoaster” and “It’s Getting Better”) released previously on Ivins’ first solo album 99¢ Dreams to showcase the songs’ evolution over the years to Jim Ivins Band songs. The band last released material in December 2010, contributing two songs to a charity compilation for Jim and Jack’s mother Kathy, a marathon runner who passed away from melanoma in July of 2010. The album, entitled Songs Of Life: The Kathy Ivins Project, was comprised of local artists and benefited The Kathy Ivins Fund, a foundation started by the family in order to benefit fitness and wellness groups, as well as to promote healthy lifestyles. Since forming in 2007, The Jim Ivins Band have been making a name for themselves in the Virginia area and beyond. Scoring rave reviews from publications like Absolutepunk.net and Property of Zack, while also garnering artist of the month honors from MuzikDizcovery.com and artist of the day at Fanbridge.com, they have proven themselves to be universally appealing, winning over audiences young and old with their unique brand of acoustic pop rock. They have been fortunate enough to share the stage with national acts such as Parachute, Carolina Liar, The Rocket Summer, Cracker, The Ataris, Mae, Carbon Leaf, Pat McGee Band, He Is We and Every Avenue as well as showcasing at the 2009 Miami Music Festival. Their 2009 self-titled EP was engineered and mixed by Grammy Award-winning engineer Michael Congdon and features the song “The Chance,” a single produced by The Early November’s Ace Enders that has caught fire on internet radio giant Pandora, racking up 160,000 spins and counting. In 2010 they signed a licensing deal with MTV. Says Skope Magazine, “whether it’s rock you crave or pop goodness that you desire, [The Jim Ivins Band] will satisfy all of your musical needs.”","<p>Richmond, VA pop rockers The Jim Ivins Band ring in 2012 with their new EP Everything We Wanted, the follow up to their 2009 Ace Enders-produced self-titled set.</p> <p>Produced by fellow Richmond native Pedro Aida (The Riot Before, Ann Berretta, Carbon Leaf), Ivins & co. have expanded their pop rock sound, from the delicate acoustics of love song “Rollercoaster” to the frenetic rock of “Emergency” and the sexy syncopation of “Lost My Mind.”</p> <p>Inspired by a recent show opening for rock radio favorites Switchfoot and The Airborne Toxic Event, Ivins decided to look farther inward when writing for Everything We Wanted, crafting a record soaked in introspection while touching on a myriad of emotions and situations like addiction (‘The Sight Of Fire’), sex (‘Lost My Mind’) and moving forward after experiencing tragedy (‘Everything We Wanted’).""</p> <p>“With half the songs having first versions written when I was 18, this record, to me, represents coming full circle and acknowledging the past while using it to shape where you’re going.

Pulling influences from a diverse spectrum of musical styles has been a big part The Raven Charter’s ability to create their own signature sound. Being able to transition from a progessive, odd-meter beatdown into a sexy groove or spacey riff is something The Raven Charter executes in an intersting yet charismatic way. Every song has a different niche and a different vibe. One of the things that The Raven Charter actively tries to achieve through their music is opening up the audience to a genre of progressive rock that they wouldnt normally experience. The combination of Daniel Baskind’s liquid shredding and Garrett Bond’s versaitle vocal range give The Raven Charter the ability to mold any type of sound out of their songs. But the defining characteristic of The Raven Charter is their live show. Intense and air-tight this band is an unstoppable force upon the stage.

Joining her is the talented Matt Venhaus on lead guitar who can shred with the best of them and dream up guitar riffs all day long. Chad Ragsdale doubles up the sound on rhythm guitar, Jason Savage brings the warlock to stage with his wicked bass and the “not so quiet” Trevor Quiett strikes fear into the heart of drum sets everywhere. Together they have an explosion of chemistry right before your eyes. In the short time they have been together they have compiled an incredible list of accomplishments including, performing close to 200 shows together, winning House of Blues Texas Highschool Rockoff, Supernova Battle of the Bands at the Curtain Club, Real Texas Festival, Richardson Wildflower Festival, Battle for America at Poor David’s Pub, 1st place in Indie pop music on Ourstage.com, 2nd place in 7-Eleven Slurpee national Battle of the Bands, Top ten finalist in SchoolJam USA put on by NAMM and performing at the NAMM show in Anaheim CA, and most recently, they won the Berklee College of Music International Battle of the Bands giving them a 25,000.00 Scholarship to Berklee’s famous Five Week program which they spent the summer of 2010 in Boston learning to be better musicians. In the fall of 2009, Jagged Row began their biggest undertaking to date, their debut cd, “Storm of Dreams”. After Jaci losing her voice 3 times during recording and 9 months of hard work, the cd was officially released in September 2010.

I am fortunate to have the people by my side who truly believe in my product as much as I do,” spoken from Seattle songwriter, Jordan Lake. Recording his first album, ‘A Collection of the Past (2008 LP),’ at 18 years old, production plans for follow-up album launched in the Summer of 2011. Teaming up with producers Brian Fennell and Brian Eichelberger from the Seattle band, Barcelona, the 12-track album ‘Consistency’ was born as Jordan Lake’s 2nd LP at 21 years old. “Everyone needs a practice album,” explains Lake. “The release of ‘A Collection of the Past’ was that for me. ‘Consistency’ is the real deal. It is the product that shows who I am and what I can do.” Since the album’s release in January of 2012, ‘Consistency’ has been spun on over 200 College radio stations across the US, and select songs have found placement onto 11 different TV shows, airing on MTV, VH1, HBO, E!, and OXYGEN. Comparing the 12 tracks on ‘Consistency’ side by side, each song arguably carries its own genre, while still relating to one another as a cohesive record. Pop hits such as “The Right Time” and “Your Voice” present a radio-friendly quality, exemplifying Lake’s peak of melodic hooks. There is even a flare of folk found in “My Harmony,” which features guest female vocalist, Austen Case. At a softer dynamic, “No More Disguise” and “Her Wedding Day” are categories in themselves of delicate emotion and mature lyrics way beyond Lake’s age. “We intentionally left these two songs fairly raw on the record,” Lake explains. “Leaving in some of those imperfections of single-take recordings really brought these songs down to a more authentic level, allowing the focus not to be on the product, but rather the song itself.” Lake’s personal approach to songwriting and his meaningful storyteller lyrics are some of his strongest features as a musician; there is truly a style and emotion for everybody. Surely, it will be exciting to witness the continual success that his latest album, “Consistency” will bring to his music career, as well as the future recordings to come.","<p>“Regardless of personal talents, it is near impossible to succeed in the music industry without making a few friends along the way.

Shes kept it quiet long enough, and it is time to tell the world. Are you ready? His name is Andy Davis, and hes about to take over your stereo. Originally from the Louisiana bayou, this 24-year-old has been residing in Nashville for the past five years. His songs are a refreshing blend of rock and folk. Like turning your pillow over in the middle of the night, Andys songs come with the cool satisfaction of what only a rare talent can bring: originality. He stands out from the array of young singer-songwriters in the Nashville area. Trying to compare Andy to others isnt easy. Some say he's like Damien Rice meets Ben Folds. Others say he is a young Billy Joel with an acoustic guitar. Listen and decide for yourself. Andy is passionately connected to each one of his songs, not completing one until it has been poured over and tweaked countless times. His lyrics are thoughtful and honest, reminding listeners of lifes most epic moments: the excitement of love, the devastation of heartache, and the search for purpose. His melodies can be soothing, moving, and sometimes just downright fun. One listen and youll be singing them to yourself for the rest of the day. With the release of his latest album Thinks Of Her, Andy showcases his raw talent and songwriting ability. This unplugged album allows listeners to hear these songs just as Andy wrote them. Some were even recorded in his home studio. Highlights include the epic Bigger Than Us, the piano-based fan favorite Brown Eyes, and the painful ballad, Black Keys. Andy graduated from Belmont University in 2003. He accredits his time at Belmont as one of the major shaping blocks for his songwriting, as he wrote many of his songs in the practice rooms at the school and recorded early demos there as well. It was also at Belmont that he met two of the members of his band, guitarist Evan Weatherford and bassist Jordan Hester. Fellow Louisiana native and drummer Mathew Linton completes the band. Fans across the southeast have enjoyed their exceptional live shows. This winter, Andy expands his sound and paints a new set of songs with a wider spectrum of insruments, as he releases the Fine China EP (Jan '07). These are the best times to follow a young artist. Andy Davis is at the beginning of what will surely prove to be a long and successful career. The secret is out and it wont be long until everyone is spreading the word about Andy Davis. -Tim Wildsmith","<p><font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""1"" color=""#033330""><strong> Acoustic / Rock / Pop</strong></font></p><p> <span class=""caps"">NASHVILLE</span> <span class=""caps"">HAS</span> A <span class=""caps"">SECRET</span> that shes been dying to tell someone about.

She follows her own vision for her music and her soul/blues/rock/acoustic/alternative style has brought comparisons to Ben Harper, Cat Power, Neko Case, Patty Griffin, Martin Sexton and others. She came up listening to all of those artists, and also to Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Eva Cassidy, Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill. She has traveled in several directions as well in her recordings and bands while defining her own personal sound and style, and this road has lead her to take the reins in her own hands and draw her own map from here forward. Mieka Pauley was born in Boston and raised in Kentucky, Colorado and South Florida. School brought her back to Boston where she makes her home. She started singing as a child and studied classical voice and piano. In high school she sang in alt rock garage bands and Motown funk bands and in jazz, classical and church choirs. In high school she taught herself guitar on an uncle’s old acoustic, then cut her teeth in college playing on the street corners of Harvard Square. Her immediate ability to captivate audiences quickly made her a favorite of Boston’s best clubs including the Paradise Lounge, House of Blues, Club Passim, and Kendall Café – next at New York’s renowned Bitter End, Living Room, Makor, Knitting Factory and Village Underground – and then at the best clubs and festivals throughout the U.S., North, South, East and West. She graduated early from Harvard in 2002 with a degree in Biological Anthropology and went out that same summer and won the BMI/Rock Boat Song Contest, took top three honors at the famed Telluride Bluegrass Festival’s Troubadour Competition, and hit the road solo full-time. By 2003 she was invited to perform at four of the top music festivals in the country – The Newport Folk Festival, On The Bricks in Atlanta, Dancin’ In The District in Nashville, and a return trip to The Rock Boat – and she made her UK debut. 2004 included the month-long Citizen Cope Northeast Tour, the first ever BMI/NACA See It Hear First showcase, a shared bill with Eric Clapton at Boston’s Tweeter Center, and the top award at the prestigious Rocky Mountain Folks Fest Songwriter Showcase. In 2005 she was nominated for a Boston Music Award, won the first ever Starbucks Emerging Artist Award, and recorded a new EP with producer John Alagia. In 2006 she was nominated for two Boston Music Awards, made her acclaimed SXSW debut, and had her first independently released radio single added into regular rotation at Top 10 Market Tastemaker Station WBOS. She has appeared on the road with Eric Clapton, Black Eyed Peas, John Legend, Wyclef Jean, Ben Kweller, John Hiatt, Citizen Cope, Blues Traveler, Martin Sexton, Mindy Smith, Jason Mraz, Edwin McCain, Shawn Mullins, Edie Brickell, Talib Kweli, Ben Lee, and Erin McKeown among many others. Northeast Performer calls her “a version of Sarah McLachlan with a switchblade in her shoe,” The Boston Globe “like Aretha in the husky vocal turns,” and The Cornerstone Player “the next meaningful female voice of her generation.” Mieka lays it out in her own lyric: “Do it bravely, save me from the weak and lazy – if you can’t face it, don’t do it at all.” Listen at Last.fm","<p>She puts her guitar in the trunk of her car and does an average of 150 live shows a year criss-crossing the country.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/passion-","Passion","Cambridge MA","","Michael Angelakos – vocals, keyboards Ian Hultquist – keyboards, guitar Ayad Al Adhamy – synthesizers, samplers Jeff Apruzzese – bass, synthesizers Nathan Donmoyer – drums Michael Angelakos hears music in his head and knows exactly how he wants it to sound. The young composer/performer has already created two studio masterpieces — Manners and Chunk of Change — and — with his fellow musicians in Passion Pit — is taking his perfectionist pop vision to a whole new level in concert. Soulful, memorable, danceable, earnest and unabashedly pop, the music Michael Angelakos delivers on Passion Pit’s debut album, Manners, reveals a complex and challenging 21st century sound and sensibility, baroque and intricate in its construction with exquisitely soaring hooks and melodies coupled with enigmatic lyrics flowing straight from the id. Launched a mere three years ago as a humble one man multi-track laptop project in Angelakos’ college dorm room, Passion Pit has rapidly evolved under fire into an in-demand concert attraction, with sold out tours and a growing international reputation based on the power and immediacy of the music. Passion Pit is a two-fold entity sharing a single essence: there’s in-the-studio Passion Pit, essentially comprised of Michael writing, designing, and constructing intricate cathedrals of sound, and Nathan Donmoyer handling live percussion and programming. Ian Hultquist is also featured on Manners performing guitar on songs such as “Make Light” and “Moth’s Wings.” And then there is the in-concert Passion Pit, a loose yet tightly calibrated ensemble who turn Angelakos’ musical studio blueprints into a cathartic live experience. Angelakos was 20 years old when Passion Pit took its first hold on his psyche in the form of a multi-song “Valentine” to his then-girlfriend, recorded in his bedroom on readily available ad hoc technology including the built-in microphone on his laptop. After signing with indie label Frenchkiss, he opted to add more recordings that had been made shortly after the he self-released the collection of songs — including the signature track “Sleepyhead” — to his dorm room set, releasing it officially as the lo-fi EP Chunk of Change. Shortly thereafter, Angelakos gave the first Passion Pit performance, which consisted of himself and a laptop singing the EP’s songs in front of some rear-screen projections in the basement of his school to approximately 15 of his friends. The “half-show/half-installation” caught the attention of Angelakos’ friend and musical acquaintance Ian Hultquist, who approached Michael about the possibility of starting a band to play the music live. A few months later, with the help of Hultquist, Angelakos was building a full ensemble capable of realizing and producing the sounds in his head and taking them to the stage. Within mere months of forming, Passion Pit — voted the Best New Local Act of 2008 in the WFNX/Boston Phoenix Best Music Poll — was opening for high profile bands like Death Cab For Cutie, Girl Talk, and Yelle, while mostly headlining their own sold-out shows. The learning curve for Passion Pit was short and steep. The pressure was unquestionably intense, especially for all shows leading up to — and even a few months of those after — the release of Manners (which often stood-in for the luxury of a proper rehearsal time). Those months of touring showcased Michael and company evolving from aesthetic chrysalis to full-fledged band, a leap that has impressed both early skeptics and die-hard fans alike. One of Angelakos’ compositions/recordings that began resonating immediately with music fans is his whirling surrealistic pop paean to sophisticated dreamland, “Sleepyhead,” with its other-dimensional choral hook sculpted from a mutated and cut-up sample of Celtic artist Mary O’Hara. Michael, who counts 70s folk among his many obsessions, is extremely hesitant to sample any music at all, preferring to use songs and sounds as cryptic reference points and textures rather than literal references. When he listened to Mary O’Hara’s take on the classic folk tune, he immediately heard a whole new song, finding in the Gaelic phrase for ‘Oh, My Little Boat,’ the perfect sonic flourish for “Sleepyhead.” The track began attracting attention shortly after he posted it online. Angelakos is continually writing according to his own technique. According to Michael, “Sleepyhead” just appeared in his head and was completed in less than two hours on his computer. Knowing exactly how to perform it vocally, he ran over to Hulquist’s apartment for the purposes of singing the song into a better microphone, and wrote the lyrics on the spot as he recorded them. By 2009, “Sleepyhead” had reached #9 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and inspired its own core of YouTube devotees interpreting the song. Michael likes the clips with acoustic guitars, finding it intriguing how fans can take such a divisive and almost-karaoke proof vocal sound and sing along to it with such enthusiasm. To date, the official “Sleepyhead” video has accrued more than 3 million views on YouTube with many of the fan tributes accumulating hundreds of thousands of views. When it came time to record an official debut album, Angelakos went to work with producer Chris Zane for Manners, the first full-length Passion Pit collection, essentially writing and playing all music on the album with the exception of programming and drumming by Nathan Donmoyer and Ian Hultquist’s guitar work on select tracks. Zane played a vital role in helping Michael realize the Passion Pit sound in the studio, eventually even developing the role of “older brother” to both Angelakos and Donmoyer during the painstaking recording process. On Manners, you can hear what someone like Angelakos does in a proper studio where he can get virtually any sound he wants. He approached the project with the intent to make an album that was “one very particular and extremely lucid snapshot of how I was feeling and existing at a particular moment.” As for the lyrical material, Angelakos purposefully matched the music with oblique, impressionistic, densely layered, abstract lyrics that utilize both phrasing and performances that, according to Michael, “were not meant in any way to match the musical content or even style of music.” It was Angelakos’ mission to mask this emotional complexity with the immediacy and irresistible nature of plain and simple pop music. Angelakos has always carried his pop vision in his head and, now that’s it’s 2010, Passion Pit is bringing that vision to the world. Stepping out from behind his keyboards to become a front-man, Angelakos is more than ably supported by Ian Hultquist and Ayad Al Adhamy on keyboards/synthesizers and a pulsing throbbing dance-heavy rhythm section consisting of Jeff Apruzzese on bass/synthesizer and studio collaborator Nate Donmoyer on drums and programming. In a little more than a year, Passion Pit has evolved from a one-man dorm room project into a burgeoning band that has surged above the buzz, capable of selling out three nights at New York’s Terminal 5 (January 2010) and a night at Prospect Park in Brooklyn. Passion Pit has even landed high-profile slots on a series of international festivals including Australia’s Big Day Out and the UK’s Glastonbury Festival as well as North American festivals including Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Coachella.","<p>Michael Angelakos – vocals, keyboards<br /> Ian Hultquist – keyboards, guitar<br /> Ayad Al Adhamy – synthesizers, samplers<br /> Jeff Apruzzese – bass, synthesizers<br /> Nathan Donmoyer – drums</p> <p>Michael Angelakos hears music in his head and knows exactly how he wants it to sound.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/murder-by-death","MURDER BY DEATH","Bloomington, IN","indie, folk, indie rock","They may call Bloomington, Indiana, home, but since their 2000 formation, Murder by Death have been a band without musical borders. Theirs is a world where Old West murder ballads mingle with rock-injected Western classicism; where an album’s sequencing can take listeners from a haunted back alley in rural Mexico to a raucous Irish pub. All of which is to say, Murder by Death albums don’t just string together songs; they create experiences. With their fifth album (and second for Vagrant), Good Morning, Magpie (04/06/10), Murder by Death continue the tradition of border expansion that drove career standouts like 2006’s In Bocca al Lupo and 2008’s Red of Tooth and Claw. The difference, however, is that this time, the band literally went off the map to get there. “Going into the woods helped me write in a way I never would’ve been able to otherwise,” says singer/guitarist Adam Turla, recalling the 2009 retreat into the Tennessee mountains during which, armed with little more than a tent, a fishing pole and a notebook, he wrote the 11 songs that would become Good Morning, Magpie. “There were days where I’d sit down and write for seven hours, make dinner, and then sit down and write late into the night with my little camp light going: just intense, nonstop sessions of pure writing. I’ve never worked that way, ever, because with all the business of being a band, I’ve never had so little to do! Every day I was either cooking, hiking while writing, or writing. I didn’t speak to a single person the whole time.” Be that as it may, Good Morning, Magpie still speaks volumes. Recorded at Bloomington’s Farm Fresh Studios with Jake Belser (who most recently worked with MBD on their all-instrumental soundtrack to Jeff Vandermeer’s 2009 book Finch), and mixed by Grammy-winning Red of Tooth and Claw producer Trina Shoemaker, the album weaves 11 disparate stories into a whole that’s unlike anything else in the band’s catalog. “These songs definitely come together as an album; we just aren’t relying on a concept this time,” says Turla, referencing the conceptual storylines that drove Murder by Death’s last two albums as well as 2002’s Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them? “Being out in the woods with no pressure freed me up to explore different moods and different stories, all of which became linked through the experience I had writing them: just that sheer sprint of working in isolation.” Even though it was written in isolation, Good Morning, Magpie came together over six weeks of rehearsals back in Bloomington—ultimately marking the first time the band recorded a full-length at home. ""We ultimately just decided to record in Bloomington because we had a friend here [Belser] with his own studio, and he’d already done a great job with the Finch soundtrack and our B-sides and 7-inches; and we also lucked out and had Trina [Shoemaker] basically making herself available to help us mix whenever we were finished. So then we started thinking, “Man, we have all this time to ourselves; we should just bring in our friends—musicians from Bloomington and Louisville, Kentucky, which is about 75 miles away—and just play parts here and there. It was great—the album ended up with a lot of different instrumentation, and we paid everyone in whiskey.” In keeping with Murder by Death tradition, whiskey also plays muse to a handful of Good Morning, Magpie’s songs—including the Balliet-penned opener, “Kentucky Bourbon,” which sounds like a Bulleit jingle spun through an old Victrola. But as the album progresses, the songs wind through other locales and moods: from eerie Southern-gothic territory (the creeping, uneasy “White Noise”) to an old Spanish cabaret (""On the Dark Streets Below”) to the high-noon drama of the title track—itself inspired equally by Welsh legend (the title references a tale of the magpie as Satan’s messenger) and the American West. No mere genre exercise, Good Morning, Magpie feels like a travelogue from a band that’s logged the miles to write from experience. They’ve toured all over the world and had their music used in everything from the trailer to Quentin Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds” to the upcoming video game “Borderlands 2”. “Travel is a big part of this band’s reason for being,” says Turla, noting that the past few years have seen Murder by Death’s passports stamped in Alaska, Greece, Norway and the Italian island of Sardinia, among other far-flung locales. They have challenged their fans to book them all over the world – in as many unique places as possible. “I personally love the sense of variety you get from traveling, and I’m sure that idea influenced the way I approached a lot of these songs. Trying to use different styles and throw in different influences—whether it’s the way you turn a phrase or play a certain note—you can suggest different places,” he concludes. “That’s the fun of fiction; that’s the fun of movies, and music can have that effect, too. It’s all about being able to transport people to another place.”","<p>They may call Bloomington, Indiana, home, but since their 2000 formation, Murder by Death have been a band without musical borders. Theirs is a world where Old West murder ballads mingle with rock-injected Western classicism; where an album’s sequencing can take listeners from a haunted back alley in rural Mexico to a raucous Irish pub. All of which is to say, Murder by Death albums don’t just string together songs; they create experiences. With their fifth album (and second for Vagrant), Good Morning, Magpie (04/06/10), Murder by Death continue the tradition of border expansion that drove career standouts like 2006’s In Bocca al Lupo and 2008’s Red of Tooth and Claw. The difference, however, is that this time, the band literally went off the map to get there.</p> <p>“Going into the woods helped me write in a way I never would’ve been able to otherwise,” says singer/guitarist Adam Turla, recalling the 2009 retreat into the Tennessee mountains during which, armed with little more than a tent, a fishing pole and a notebook, he wrote the 11 songs that would become Good Morning, Magpie. “There were days where I’d sit down and write for seven hours, make dinner, and then sit down and write late into the night with my little camp light going: just intense, nonstop sessions of pure writing. I’ve never worked that way, ever, because with all the business of being a band, I’ve never had so little to do! Every day I was either cooking, hiking while writing, or writing. I didn’t speak to a single person the whole time.”</p> <p>Be that as it may, Good Morning, Magpie still speaks volumes. Recorded at Bloomington’s Farm Fresh Studios with Jake Belser (who most recently worked with <span class=""caps"">MBD</span> on their all-instrumental soundtrack to Jeff Vandermeer’s 2009 book Finch), and mixed by Grammy-winning Red of Tooth and Claw producer Trina Shoemaker, the album weaves 11 disparate stories into a whole that’s unlike anything else in the band’s catalog. “These songs definitely come together as an album; we just aren’t relying on a concept this time,” says Turla, referencing the conceptual storylines that drove Murder by Death’s last two albums as well as 2002’s Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them? “Being out in the woods with no pressure freed me up to explore different moods and different stories, all of which became linked through the experience I had writing them: just that sheer sprint of working in isolation.”</p> <p>Even though it was written in isolation, Good Morning, Magpie came together over six weeks of rehearsals back in Bloomington—ultimately marking the first time the band recorded a full-length at home. ""We ultimately just decided to record in Bloomington because we had a friend here [Belser] with his own studio, and he’d already done a great job with the Finch soundtrack and our B-sides and 7-inches; and we also lucked out and had Trina [Shoemaker] basically making herself available to help us mix whenever we were finished. So then we started thinking, “Man, we have all this time to ourselves; we should just bring in our friends—musicians from Bloomington and Louisville, Kentucky, which is about 75 miles away—and just play parts here and there.

While their hometown counterparts follow Iggy Pop’s footsteps so closely they’re practically ripping the skin off his heels, Deadstring Brothers style embraces a sound from somewhere far beyond the Wayne County line. Starving Winter Report, Deadstring Brothers’ debut Bloodshot release, pulses with exuberant arrangements painted with the nostalgic call of the Rhodes piano, Stax-worthy horns and lonesome-prairie pedal steel. Frontman Kurt Maschke’s warm and rolling lyrics and rock chanteuse Masha Marijieh’s sultry vocals are the spine of the band; sustaining vocal harmonies so sweet and inseverable a crowbar couldn’t pry them loose. It’s an album with an undeniable flair that cries out for some big speakers, a Detroit rag top with a case of Stroh’s in the trunk, and a reason to get good and GONE. The band has been touring steadily since the 2003 release of their debut and have shared the stage with acts ranging from Cat Power and Jesse Sykes to Giant Sand, My Morning Jacket, Drive by Truckers and the Mekons. Listen at Last.fm Country / Blues / AlternativeDeadstring Brothers: Country Toughs from the Motor City It may be a surprise to hear the wistful Americana sounds of Detroits Deadstring Brothers coming from a city better known for loud rock, but disillusionment can take many channels. Desolation, frustration and regret have always been present where great country music was played, and from its bombed-out inner city to its sterile suburbs, Detroit has its share. Deadstring Brothers began in fall 2001. Since then, the band has worked to develop their own take on Americana, drawing influences from a variety of sources. Its all in there somehow, declares Marschke, but blues and country music just feel the most natural. Not unlike Exile-era Stones, Deadstring Brothers deliver a menacing sound that draws equally on the melancholy of country ballads and the abandon of rock and blues. The bands music is deeply rooted in the storytelling and instrumental traditions of Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, and the Outlaw Movement, but is also informed by the song structure and understated aggression commonly associated with Detroit bands. Their haunting melodies reveal the influence of early 70s rock icons like The Band and Gram Parsons, while Marschkes vocals betray the more modern influence of outré singer/songwriters like Jeff Buckley, Leonard Cohen, and Nick Cave. Deadstring Brothers live performances have the energy of lo-fi guitar rock, but sophisticated arrangements and a focus on traditional American music separate them from many of their Detroit contemporaries. The band has been touring steadily since the 2003 release of their eponymous debut and have shared the stage with acts ranging from Cat Power and Jesse Sykes to Giant Sand, My Morning Jacket, Drive by Truckers and the Mekons.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/goodbye-june","Goodbye June","Tennessee","","To get a feel for Goodbye June, you should start with these ideas: Family, music and faith. In no particular order. Goodbye June was formed in the Summer of 2005 by three cousins, Brandon Qualkenbush, Landon Milbourn and Tyler Baker. Tyler’s brother, PFC Shane Baker, had just tragically passed away in a car accident while home on leave. The unexpected loss had undoubtedly shaken this close-knit family to its core. Brandon and Landon then spent a few weeks with Tyler and his family to help ease the sting. “When Brandon and Landon showed up, I knew that our brother, Shane, was really gone for good,” says Tyler reminiscing about the day that his cousins came to his family’s house in Southern Indiana. “For the next few weeks, they stayed with me and my family; we talked about old times, laughed and cried over memories and, of course, played music together. Songs formed and before we knew it, we were getting requests to play on the back of semi-trailers, church youth functions, and clubs. Goodbye June came to fruition because we all shared a passion for music and Shane’s death helped us realize that life is short and you never know when you will leave this world.” The cousins were all raised in very conservative yet musical backgrounds. Brandon’s father is a preacher and Landon’s father is a church choir director. The three inevitably grew up immersed in an impressive array of music, whether it was the classic old country hymns or black gospel. “Being around gospel choirs, fiery services, and musicians all your life kind of puts that itch in you to play music and play it to move people,” says Landon, lead singer. Heavily influenced by their upbringing, Goodbye June blends these early influences with blues, garage rock, and pop to form their sound. They write straight from the heart and use what they’re feeling at the time, so don’t be surprised when you hear a pop love ballad following a country-western garage rock song. Goodbye June, not surprisingly considering their background and strong faith, initially began as a Christian band and toured the church circuit for nearly three years. When they decided to leave the church tour and make the daunting move to Nashville, they jumped in headfirst whole-heartedly without any real certainty of how they were actually going to break into the music scene. “Our first year in town was the hardest part,” explains Brandon. “We threw out every song we had ever written to build who Goodbye June is today. That was scary. Over the course of that year we struggled to eat and pay bills. We met plenty of nay-sayers and haters, including a few family members, but we were here doing what we were doing because we love music and felt we had something to say.” Brandon, Tyler and Landon together write songs that fundamentally have depth and meaning. There tends to always be a positive message in all of Goodbye June’s songs. Whether it’s talking about running to God or away from him, you will definitely get a good understanding of what these guys really believe in. “Even if we sing songs about rowdy nights and ghost hunting, family remains the core of what we have built Goodbye June around,” says Tyler. Check Out Goodbye June’s Music on their website at www.goodbyejune.com. Goodbye June has recently signed with CVR Management as of July 2010. The band is working with veteran producers J Gary and John Smith to write and record a new album that will be available this year. Look for Goodbye June’s latest updates on the website and listen to their music sampler comprised of 3 brand new songs.

Before the age of five, she remembers being enraptured by the voices of the gospel choir in her hometown’s Methodist church. She began dabbling with musical instruments when she was eight years old, finally settling with her true companion, the guitar. 1950’s rock and roll led her to its roots in old country, where she found the songs of Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and young Elvis Presley. She then began writing and performing her own songs, pulling from the honesty and the simplicity of her influences. Elsa captivates audiences throughout the Seacoast with her powerful solo shows.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/julie-nolen","Julie Nolen","Austin, Texas","","Julie Nolen & Telling Stories Telling Stories is a ten year collaboration between Austin songwriters Julie Nolen and Terry Dossey. Nolen rode in on a Greyhound from Abilene, Texas and a short time later met Dossey, a veteran producer and instrumentalist for various Austin female fronted bands including Natalie Zoe, Shelley King, Joanna DeJarnett, just to name a few. Julie and Terry deliver solid songwriting and sprited performances, memorable melodies over danceable grooves which work equally well on the dance floor or in the coffeehouse, demonstrating that “attitude is audible.” Nolen and Dossey write across many genres including rock, pop, Latin, funk, Americana and country, the cohesive thread being solid funky grooves, melodic harmony vocals, and evocative and insightful lyrics. Their songs tell compelling stories of loves won and lost, betrayals and triumphs, and other convoluted tragedies and comedies relating to the human condition and relationships. The band consists of an elastic and spellbinding configuration of amazing Austin musicians anchored on drums by Daniel Jones, on bass by Joe Zito, and on keyboards by David Webb. They are equally at home in stage or studio, and can be seen performing weekly at many of Austin’s finest venues or on the world stage through the medium of Second Life. Telling Stories released its second album, “Dirty Little Secrets” on June 1st, 2010, and can currently be seen performing live on PACT TV in Austin, Texas. Their first CD, “Greyhound,” was released in February 2004 to much critical acclaim, still selling steadily to date.","<p>Julie Nolen & Telling Stories</p> <p>Telling Stories is a ten year collaboration between Austin songwriters Julie Nolen and Terry Dossey.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/nathan-strubhart","Nathan Strubhart","Riviera, TX","","Growing up, Nathan listened to anything from oldies, grunge, hip-hop, rock and country legends, but yet found his passion in the strums of the acoustic guitar. A bad block to the knee at a high school football game left him injured and unable to play sports, which had been this all-around athlete’s dream for college. Some believe everything happens for a reason. The same could be said for the football injury, as this incident led him down a path full of music as he invested his heart and soul into this new found passion. As time progressed, Nathan began to choose his old guitar over playing football. From his sister’s sensible choice in music; his brother’s hard rock attitude; his father’s choice of classic country; and his mother’s choice of anything with a good beat; he finds a soothing place in between and loves the sounds of artists like Jack Johnson, Johnny Cash, Sublime, Nick Drake, Counting Crows, and Dave Matthews. Nathan’s true sound is a breath of fresh air, as he chooses not to replicate the sounds of his favorites, but rather prefers a solid spin and writes about what makes him feel like the world is at his fingertips. He is dedicated to his own songwriting and production of his own material. Evidence of a fully developed passion, he sings his own lyrics of truth and meaning, and on occasion, an alter ego by the name of “Iceberg” will emerge lending true talent toward a funny take on his version of hip hop demonstrating Nathan’s unnatural ability to showcase rap skills every musician wants to have. Now a college graduate, Nathan looks forward to dedicating more time and energy to his one true obsession…music. His talents and artistic expression are evident on a new CD with a plethora of music and lyrics. Nathan’s dream is to write, sing, produce, and play music he appreciates and loves. Corpus Christi, Texas is home to this musician. Songs of life, love and his favorite place on Earth (Texas) make up his current play list, but the best and most innovating aspect of this artist is that he writes, produces and sings his own lyrics, all of which was self-taught. Nathan is the definition of a self-made musician and artist with limitless potential.","<p>Growing up, Nathan listened to anything from oldies, grunge, hip-hop, rock and country legends, but yet found his passion in the strums of the acoustic guitar.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-southern-renaissance","The Southern Renaissance","Dallas, Tx","","As frontman Michael Donner entered the Dallas music scene in 2011, he had partnered up with old friends Eric Pearson and Jackson Giles to help bring some of his songs to life and get them out in the open. The trio put their heads down, drawing from influences such as Ryan Adams, Bob Dylan, and The Band, and they constructed a cohesive Americana/Alt-Country album that took them to a studio in historic Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Michael Donner & The Southern Renaissance’s debut album, “No Better Time”, was engineered and produced by Ben Tanner (touring keyboardist with The Alabama Shakes) and was released in September 2011. The album earned them high marks from the local music scene, being deemed “not only one of the best under the radar releases of the year, [but] one of the best releases period.” (Chip Frazier, Twangville). The Dallas Observer even listed it as one the “Four North Texas Albums You Need”. Furthermore, they were nominated for the Dallas Observer Music Awards 2012 as Best Country Act. Since that release, the group added a full-time rhythm section with new members John Aisner (drums) and Blake Butler (bass). Riding on the popularity of their debut album and by their memorable and energetic live performances, the group has been given the opportunity to provide direct support for major artists such as Dr. Dog, The Civil Wars, Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit, Ray Wylie Hubbard, The Heartless Bastards, Wayne Hancock, Milo Greene, Dylan LeBlanc, Will Hoge, The Wheeler Brothers, Kevin Eubanks, and Junior Brown. With a full time five-piece band, the group has undertaken a much more collaborative writing process and are preparing to release the full group’s debut E.P in spring 2013. They are now known only as The Southern Renaissance.","<p>As frontman Michael Donner entered the Dallas music scene in 2011, he had partnered up with old friends Eric Pearson and Jackson Giles to help bring some of his songs to life and get them out in the open.

His new persona was developed to pursue his interest in exploring the deeper,darker side of tech house and techno. With the Texas Techno community emerging as one of the fastest growing communities in the world heavily influenced by Keine (Lonnie Burnside) and his band of house & techno junkies . you’re sure to see Keine Moniker on top as one of the leading most influential arists in the emerging texas techno scene. coming from a musical family, His passion for music began when he was only 6 years old banging on anything that produced a sound (leading to a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and prescription for ritalin for constant desk drumming during his elementary school years).From that point forward, with the help of prescribed methamphetamine, he taught himself how to play piano, saxophone guitar and just about any other instrument he could get his hands on playing various instruments in several bands ranging from gutter punk rock all the way to jazz. His interest in dance music manifested after finding himself in a vacant warehouse that had been converted into a dark throbbing techno dungeon while running from police after a highschool party he attended was broken up. Instantly mesmerized by the dj’s ability turn 100’s of party goers into what seemed like one living pulsing organism, he immediately picked up a set of turntables and started collecting everything he could from drum and bass to breaks to house and techno. By the time he was only 17 he was already holding down top residencies in his home town of corpus christi tx, and quickly became one of the most prominent djs in the city. After attending a local community college and accompanying several local jazz bands as a pianist and saxophonist. his interest manifested into production and more jazz oriented deeper house music influenced heavily by san fransisco’s deep house legend and naked music owner Miguel Migs. .

It was after attending the winter music conference in 2008 that his interest in darker tech house and techno began to surface thanks in large part to a mind blowing 8 hr set by Richie Hawtin.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/brain-gang-blue","Brain Gang Blue","Dallas, Tx","","Straight out of Dallas, Texas, the experimental beat scientist known as Brandon “Brain Gang” Blue started his musical voyage in 2004. Trying to follow in the footsteps of his influences: Timbaland, Missy Elliot, & The Neptunes, Blue always felt like he could be the next innovative music producer. Blue is well known locally for his extensive work with the artist, Dorrough Music, while attending Prairie View A&M University in ‘05-’06 (Get Like Me Vol. 1 &2) & the production he’s done for the groundbreaking Dallas duo known as Sore Losers in ‘07-’10 (Free Loaders, Get A Life). Those projects also set Blue up for nation success as well. He gained placements with Kendrick Lamar (P&P, P&P 1.5, & Faith), Mac Miller (Down The Rabbit Hole), Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Mod Sun & The Rej3ctz. Blue has always traveled back and forth between Dallas & Los Angeles for inspiration and networking. While in LA, Blue discovered a love for the night life where he picked up on electronic music such as pop, techno, house, and dub step. He then started adding this sound to his, already unique hip hop style, and branded it as “Experimental Hip Hop” due to how different the sound was. Looking to expose this new sound to a larger audience, Blue chose a new form of self-expression as he decided to become an artist himself and released a solo EP entitled “Numb.” at the end of 2011. The EP was well received amongst the public & held a huge internet presence on Hip Hop blogs (2DopeBoyz, OnSmash, Sneak Hype, & More), proving that there is a lane for something as unique and different. “Numb.” is filled with an electro influence.. Dubstep wobbles over Hip Hop drums, heavy electric synths with Texas style “screw” hooks over them, & uptempo beats with thought provoking lyrics which work together on a project that has a high level of replay value. Blue plans to continue this success into 2012. He promises that this is the year that he really bounces into the national spotlight as both a trendsetter in sound and as a provocative lyricist.","<p>Straight out of Dallas, Texas, the experimental beat scientist known as Brandon “Brain Gang” Blue started his musical voyage in 2004.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/king-ashoka","King Ashoka","Dallas","","With his sophomore album, “Timely Evolution” King Ashoka combines provocative street poetry with hot club tracks to create the most imaginative musical collaboration to come out of the Dallas hip hop scene yet. This emotionally charged masterpiece has been four years in the making and the result is an eclectic collection of fierce rhymes and original get-your-blood-flowing beats. Ashoka has long been known for his gritty voice and in-your-face performance style and this project does not disappoint. Full of raw emotion, “Timely Evolution” takes the listener on Ashoka’s journey of pleasure and pain as he battles his way to the forefront of life. Nearly every track offers lessons from his years as a struggling artist. Each song is chalk full of his experiences with family, drugs, women, violence, betrayal-even death. When asked what sets him apart from other MC’s, his constant response is, “I tell the truth.” And it is this deep desire to enlighten and inspire that drives his creativity. He is more than a performer. He is a loving Father, Teacher, Artist & Leader. This should be no surprise from a man named for the Indian Emperor known for his benevolence and lasting moral edicts. His sound, most closely resembling a mix between Scarface, Petey Pablo and Mystikal has also helped to earn him a considerable local following. On “Timely Evolution” Ashoka takes it even further by bringing together some of the most notable talent to come out of Texas. Erykah Badu, Gemini, Paul wall and M Dot are among the artists that bring their award-winning skills out for creatively inspiring collaborations on this album. Until now, King Ashoka has been largely unknown outside of Dallas, but that is changing rapidly. In October, his song “Life Is” was featured on ABC’s acclaimed show Lincoln Heights and last spring his song “Fire It Up” was on the soundtrack of the feature film “The Benchwarmers” starring David Spade, Rob Schneider and Jon Heder. With the upcoming release of “Timely Evolution” The Juggernaut that is King Ashoka is certain to be on a collision course with Hip-Hop History.","<p>With his sophomore album, “Timely Evolution” King Ashoka combines provocative street poetry with hot club tracks to create the most imaginative musical collaboration to come out of the Dallas hip hop scene yet. This emotionally charged masterpiece has been four years in the making and the result is an eclectic collection of fierce rhymes and original get-your-blood-flowing beats. Ashoka has long been known for his gritty voice and in-your-face performance style and this project does not disappoint.</p> <p>Full of raw emotion, “Timely Evolution” takes the listener on Ashoka’s journey of pleasure and pain as he battles his way to the forefront of life. Nearly every track offers lessons from his years as a struggling artist. Each song is chalk full of his experiences with family, drugs, women, violence, betrayal-even death.</p> <p>When asked what sets him apart from other MC’s, his constant response is, “I tell the truth.” And it is this deep desire to enlighten and inspire that drives his creativity. He is more than a performer. He is a loving Father, Teacher, Artist & Leader. This should be no surprise from a man named for the Indian Emperor known for his benevolence and lasting moral edicts.</p> <p>His sound, most closely resembling a mix between Scarface, Petey Pablo and Mystikal has also helped to earn him a considerable local following. On “Timely Evolution” Ashoka takes it even further by bringing together some of the most notable talent to come out of Texas. Erykah Badu, Gemini, Paul wall and M Dot are among the artists that bring their award-winning skills out for creatively inspiring collaborations on this album.</p> <p>Until now, King Ashoka has been largely unknown outside of Dallas, but that is changing rapidly.

Starting off at a young age playing piano, drums, and writing songs, he has always been very passionate about music. He grew up listening to classic rock with his father and eventually got really deep into hip hop, always having an open mindset and appreciation towards all kinds of music. After high school he moved out to Dallas, TX to study film and music where he built many working relationships with other upcoming artists from the area. He is currently living in Austin, TX working to perfect his craft everyday from late nights in the studio to promoting for upcoming shows. Lace writes songs almost daily focusing on his lyrical content and delivery. You can catch him writing about anything from common struggles, random thoughts and dreams, all the way to story raps. He has played shows at different venues all over Texas with local artists and has also opened up for a few bigger names such as Kendrick Lamar, Cyhi da Prynce, Big Krit, Smoke DZA, Freddie Gibbs, and Machine Gun Kelly. His debut mixtape ‘The Elbow Doctor’ is set to be releasing some time very soon in the near future. Every Tuesday is #LaceTunesday where he releases a new track, beat, or mix that either himself or someone that he works close with has created.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/noah-neiman","Noah Neiman","Austin, TX","","Noah Neiman’s foray into the world of music started at the very young age of 4 years, when he first started playing the piano. Through grade school, he learned to play the violin and trombone as well. However, it was not until he was 10 years old that he finally fell in love with electronic music. Influenced by mid to late 80’s and early 90’s music, Noah began experimenting with synthesizers, drum machines and computer based music creation, penning his first riffs on a rudimentary midi program with his father’s 486 PC. Nevertheless, Noah’s love for music was eclipsed by another life’s passion. As time wore on, music started to become more of a hobby of his while his education toward becoming a doctor took more precedence. Eventually, Noah was accepted to optometry school and prepared to spend more time than ever immersed in books and notes to become an optometrist… but although school took up the majority of his time, music began beating back into his life. With every spare minute, Noah would be on his Mac, and eventually released ‘Run With Me,’ a track featuring the vocals of Catherine W. and co-produced by his longtime friend, MST. Noah’s own remix of the track would go on to hit #17 on Beatport.com’s Top 100 Trance chart, while the original version of the track was played on numerous radio shows, including Armin Van Buuren’s ‘A State of Trance.’ Soon afterward, Noah had two more tracks to break Beatport’s Top 100 Trance, including a remix for Markus Schulz’s Coldharbour digital imprint, ‘Karanda – On Hold feat. David Call (Noah Neiman Remix).’ Since taking his digital music career by the reins, Noah’s tracks have been featured on countless internet and syndicated radio shows, and supported by world-class DJs, including Markus Schulz, Ferry Corsten, Armin Van Buuren, Solar Stone, Andy Moor, Matt Darey and Mark Pledger, among many others. Striking a balance between his careers as a doctor and a record producer has been a constant push and pull, but as he has just recently graduated from optometry school, Noah plans to devote more time to the studio and potentially begin touring as a DJ to promote the music he has, only until now, written for others to play!","<p>Noah Neiman’s foray into the world of music started at the very young age of 4 years, when he first started playing the piano.

But for PB Wolf the DJ/recording artist/producer, here’s a quick rundown. As a young kid growing up in San Jose, Chris Manak soon realized he needed an escape from the realities of suburbian life in the Silicon Valley. The age of nine was his coming of age. This was the year he discovered sports (Pittsburgh Pirates), video games (Pac man), girls (Anita Balderama), and hip hop (“Rappers Delight”). Alongside partner Sweet Steve, young Chris fashioned primitive mix-tapes (using the pause button) and ran amok at the local roller rink. He took on the name Peanut Butter Wolf in the late-80s when he realized that, in an odd turn of events, a girlfriend’s youngest brother feared the “peanut butter wolf monster” more than death itself. Wolf and his more conventionally-named counterpart, Charizma, began recording in 1989 when the two were still teenagers. Within three years, the duo signed a contract with Hollywood Basic (Disney) alongside label mates Organized Konfusion and DJ Shadow. Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf were riding high, touring Europe, receiving press in magazines such as Billboard and (a then newspaper format) Urb, hanging with radio legends Sway & King Tech on Wake Up Show and performing live shows with groups like House of Pain, Nas and The Pharcyde. Then, in December of 1993, Charizma tragically lost his life. Stunned, Wolf temporarily gave up on music. After releasing the song “Just Like A Test” with Charizma for David Paul’s Bomb Hip Hop Compilation early in 1994, Upstairs Records, a label known primarily for house music, approached Wolf to record an instrumental LP. Thus, the Peanut Butter Breaks was born; the record became the Wolf’s calling card, leading to meetings and collaborations with like-minded DJs like Q-bert, Cut Chemist and Rob Swift. After the release of Peanut Butter Breaks, PB Wolf found himself in demand as a producer. His track for the all-scratching compilation Return of the DJ was labeled “incredible” by The Source magazine. He released a 6 song compilation for South Paw Records in 1995, featuring collaborations with up and coming San Jose MCs. He also produced Kool Keith’s first single as a solo artist “Wanna Be A Star.” These releases, amongst others, led to a picture disc EP for British label 2 Kool Records. In 1996, Peanut Butter Wolf founded Stones Throw Records. Charizma’s posthumous “My World Premiere” was the single to launch the label. A few highlights in the beginning were the songs “Unassisted” by Rasco, Super Duck Breaks LP by DJ Babu, and hip hop 7” series. Lately, PB Wolf has moved away from producing (save the odd remix or compilation track) to build the Stones Throw label and to travel as a DJ to Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and across the US. Through his willingness to experiment and provide Stones Throw’s artists with musical carte blanche, he has overseen the releases of Lootpack’s Soundpieces, Quasimoto’s The Unseen, Breakestra’s Live Mix, Yesterdays New Quintet’s Angles Without Edges, Madlib’s Shades of Blue, and Jaylib’s Champion Sound.","<p>You can read more about Peanut Butter Wolf and Stones Throw Records in the History section of stonesthrow.com.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/karriem-riggins","Karriem Riggins","DETROIT","","Karriem Riggins is best known as a jazz drummer and hip-hop producer for artists like Common, Slum Village, Talib Kweli and The Roots, but he doesn’t categorize himself as anything but an artist. He advises younger musicians to do the same. “You don’t have to put yourself in a box…there’s so many different ways to go,” Riggins says. A student of late jazz bassist Ray Brown, he tours with another Brown protégé, Grammy Award winner Diana Krall. In 2011, he collaborated with former Beatle Paul McCartney in concert and on Kisses on the Bottom, McCartney’s first studio release in five years. Names of some of the jazz artists he’s backed reads like the genre’s hall of fame – Hank Jones, Oscar Peterson, Milt Jackson, Donald Byrd and Ron Carter. But on his solo debut Alone Together, set for an October 23 release on Stones Throw Records, Riggins plants himself firmly as a hip-hop producer with a 34-track instrumental odyssey through nearly every influence on his career thus far. The project was inspired by much of the music he was creating while living in Los Angeles, and also by the love of his son and family. Now residing in his native Detroit, Riggins is back where it all began. “I feel like I can really breath and stay inspired here, and I have room to set up my lab and be creative,” he says. This is the rationale behind the title Alone Together, taken from a jazz standard written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz that begin with the words, “Alone together, above the crowd.” “Coming back to the machines, I feel like I can really express myself,” Riggins says. “This is the way that I express my rhythms.” Machines, however, are just one way he expresses his rhythms. Midway through the album, the track “Water” is interrupted by a vocal snippet where the speaker places Riggins “right at the intersection of hip-hop and jazz.” Alone Together is that intersection; it’s the jazz music he’s played professionally since the age of 19, and it’s crafting beats like “Africa” on an MPC5000 while touring throughout Eastern Europe and Russia. “I need the balance,” Riggins says, of working with the likes of Krall and McCartney, and also being able to go back to the studio and create hip-hop. “Without that, I couldn’t be who I am.” Songs on Alone Together range from 14 seconds to a little over three minutes, and are the essence of man vs. machine. When Riggins channels Elvin Jones on the album’s climax and tribute to his longtime friend, “J Dilla the Greatest,” his tools are a Gretsch drum kit, the Fender Rhodes and an MPC3000. As versed as he is in jazz and pop, the machines will always be at the root – until the next thing. “There’s always something new to figure out,” he says. “That’s the blessing in it.” — Ronnie Reese","<p>Karriem Riggins is best known as a jazz drummer and hip-hop producer for artists like Common, Slum Village, Talib Kweli and The Roots, but he doesn’t categorize himself as anything but an artist.

This is the rationale behind the title Alone Together, taken from a jazz standard written by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz that begin with the words, “Alone together, above the crowd.”</p> <p>“Coming back to the machines, I feel like I can really express myself,” Riggins says. “This is the way that I express my rhythms.”</p> <p>Machines, however, are just one way he expresses his rhythms. Midway through the album, the track “Water” is interrupted by a vocal snippet where the speaker places Riggins “right at the intersection of hip-hop and jazz.” Alone Together is that intersection; it’s the jazz music he’s played professionally since the age of 19, and it’s crafting beats like “Africa” on an MPC5000 while touring throughout Eastern Europe and Russia.</p> <p>“I need the balance,” Riggins says, of working with the likes of Krall and McCartney, and also being able to go back to the studio and create hip-hop. “Without that, I couldn’t be who I am.”</p> <p>Songs on Alone Together range from 14 seconds to a little over three minutes, and are the essence of man vs. machine. When Riggins channels Elvin Jones on the album’s climax and tribute to his longtime friend, “J Dilla the Greatest,” his tools are a Gretsch drum kit, the Fender Rhodes and an MPC3000. As versed as he is in jazz and pop, the machines will always be at the root – until the next thing.</p> <p>“There’s always something new to figure out,” he says. “That’s the blessing in it.”</p> <p>— Ronnie Reese</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7769538/2e515ddd68dc29a3aa50a8c3fa7fd98e_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/55Lf1wMylIE?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/dean-johanesen","Dean Johanesen","Lake Ronkonkoma, Long Island NY","","Born in Lake Ronkonkoma NY. Moved all over the states with my Mom and siblings. When we were young my Mom delivered motor homes and were listening to 8 track tapes of the Eagles, John Denver, Dolly Parton, Led Zepplin, Simon and Garfunkel etc. In New York, I have a distinct memory of my Uncle Jimmy letting me use his trumpet when I was little while he listened to Zepplin records in his room. My Mom let me strum her guitar on her lap and she would change chords and sing to me. I played snare drum in 3rd grade for an elementary school march. I played my first tennis racket at about 8, I think, to Rick Springfiled’s Working Class Dog on Casette. The bed was my stage and I loved to jump and stum. I received my first real guitar at age 12. It was a pearl white Ibanez electric hanging in the window of a guitar shop in Las Vegas. I went to Elementary school and started middle school in Vegas before moving back to NY in 6th / 7th grade. I wanted that guitar because in my mind it looked like Prince’s guitar in Purple Rain. I still have the guitar and have handed it down to my son. Started really playing at age 14, took some lessons from a guy named Stan Wright who was one of my favorite guitar teachers. Studied Jazz Commercial Music Performance at 5 Towns College of Music in Dix Hills New York before moving to Atlanta GA and then on to FL. Currently I reside in Bradenton FL with my wife and my son. I perform 3 to 5 nights a week solo, with the band and in a Rumba duo performing Latin jazz and traditional Spanish music. It has taken a long time to get to a place where I can support myself and my family playing music. I am fortunate that I am able to do so now and I enjoy every minute of it despite the long hours sometimes and the late nights. Over the past few years the music program I started for pre-school children has turned into a full time job on top of my solo performances and other musical endeavors such as the band, The Human Condition and the Rumba group, Duende. I have toured and performed at SXSW, been a finalist in Songwriter Competitions at Suwannee Music park in 2006 & 2008 for Springfest. In 2011 I was able to tour London England for a little over a week performing 4 dates with some help from some great fans and friends. I also toured up to NY and back in February of 2011 with shows in Atlanta, North Carolina, New York City and Buffalo. Our local radio station 88.5FM WMNF has had the band and myself on numerous times and on different shows with different DJs performing live and promtoing releases and local shows and tours etc. I was also able to be interviewed in Austin TX during SXSW March of 2012 on a show called Writing ON The Air. This year I am working on my first official solo CD. I am hoping to release it before the end of 2012 and tour in support. The new CD will feature old and new songs in a stripped down format focusing on the vocals, acoustic guitar and the lyrics to the tunes. Sparse production on this one in the vein of the Civil Wars, Ryan Adams Ashes and Fire and Johnny Cash on the American Recording sessions. Looking forward to more music in the years to come. Hope to share it all with you and with more of you as time rolls on here. Thank you for stopping by the page and please email me if you have any questions.

The young songwriter comes by her fears more honestly than most, battling a serious (and ongoing) illness at age 9 and losing her father at 14. She grew up fast, at first rebelling, then spending several years on a curious solo journey across the country studying philosophy, theology and writing songs. Now in Nashville, she’s readying her 12-song February 5, 2013 release with plenty of industry buzz, receiving compliments from The Lefsetz Letter, M: Music and Musicians, Kings of A&R and more.Adept on the piano and guitar, the singer/songwriter says she was “raised on James Taylor and Lauren Hill. Music Connection has named her as one of the “Best Unsigned Artists of 2012,” and Labrie will be part of the iTunes Nashville Indie Spotlight including Brooke Waggoner, Matthew Perryman Jones, Katie Herzig and Mindy Smith.”Perhaps the song that has gotten the most attention is “I Remember A Boy,” backed by soulful guitar tones that hint at Daniel Lanois. “…This track affected me. Made me believe like the great singer-songwriters of yore, maybe this woman has something to say. That in this crazy, mixed-up, shook-up world she can illuminate her story and people can relate.” Bob Lefsetz, The Lefsetz LetterThe title track is a lush and rich plea that would fit alongside a playlist that includes Carol King and Norah Jones. “Gettin’ Tired” showcases her penchant for jazz, a gift from her father who, “played original, complicated and beautiful songs regardless of the fact that he was never professionally trained,” she shares. In “Heartache of Love” Shannon showcases not only her talent on piano but also reveals her more intimate side, reveling in the feelings of love and loss.Despite many of Labrie’s hardships, she has managed to find the good side in her infectious song “Love Somebody.” “When I am in my darkest moments of loss, doubt and pain, I am shown what it looks like to love someone and to be loved. My closest friends didn’t run, didn’t give up, and didn’t let me sink. They stuck with me and brought me to the other side. I can only hope to bring that same message to anyone.”Labrie’s original song, “You Found Me,” was recorded exclusively as a pivotal song in the movie (and on the soundtrack) for the major motion picture “Make Your Move” out Sept of 2013. She is now out touring to promote “Just be Honest” which released Feb 5, featuring dates at LA’s The Hotel Cafe, Rockwood Music Hall, SXSW Week and performing at the annual NON-COMMvention in May.","<p>On Shannon Labrie’s debut album Just Be Honest, she kicks off the proceedings by staring down her demons and admonishing her biggest fears with “Secret,” a retro-R&B influenced song laced with vibrant horns.

After years of paying dues as a stellar ax-man and astute songwriter in clubs and bars all over Long Island and New York City with his former bands, Eddie has laid down his guitar and traded up for a microphone, assembling some of the best musicians on Long Island who have come to truly believe in the new music and round out the project that’s really turning some heads. The members of I Ignite are comprised of veteran members from some of the Island’s best local acts under and ON the radar including: For The Taking, Aprils End, Blameshift, The New Black, and The Apparition. “I Ignite is about life and lessons learned”, says vocalist Eddie Raccioppi who wrote and recorded the bands 8 song CD on his own. His most recent songs, “Without You” and “Falling”, are already on heavy east coast terrestrial and local Internet radio station rotation. 2012 looks to be a very promising year for I Ignite with new music, photo shoots, and a music video lined up for the band before the start of the summer months. I Ignite bring to the table a refreshing level of energy, heart, and excitement that some bands lack in today’s commercial music industry.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/jillette-johnson","Jillette Johnson","New York, NY","","On August 14th singer-songwriter Jillette Johnson releases the smoldering and passionate debut EP Whiskey & Frosting (Wind-up Records). It’s an intimate and boldly emotional five-song collection of stately pop from a unique and unflinchingly honest artist. Johnson’s commitment to her distinct vision is thorough and uncompromising, from her willingness to explore the raw and controversial in her lyrics, to her unwillingness to give into tempting hot ticket-career opportunities. Johnson audaciously declined a high-exposure spot on the television talent show The Voice to keep her creative autonomy. “I realized those paths would be inauthentic to me. I know how to write my own music, and I want a say in my career,” Johnson explains. Whiskey & Frosting is one of those rare and revelatory debuts where you experience a young songwriter with a highly mature sense of artistic self. The NYC-based singer-piano player wrote all the songs on the EP, and her upcoming album. The piano-based songs unfold with honeyed drama and grandeur, showcasing Johnson’s soaring vocals which manage to both be comforting and spiritually rousing. “Two of my favorite things are whiskey and frosting,” Johnson says laughing. “The title came directly from an impromptu birthday party with friends where I ate the frosting off cupcakes and drank whiskey. I was telling my producers about the night when I realized how similar those two things were to my writing style. I don’t write happy songs without some melancholy feelings in there. I like to paint an entire emotional picture. There is depth, sorrow, and overly sweet tones. Many of the songs are about living as a young person in New York City, living irresponsibly and exploring consequences.” The bravely vulnerable “Cameron” explores the struggle of a transgendered person and transpires a universal anthem for staying true to oneself. Johnson sings: Cameron’s in drag, makes his father mad / Since he was a little boy / He always felt more comfortable in lipstick / These days the world is full of aliens / The world is full of aliens, but you are a human / You’re not an alien / You are a real live human / Aren’t you, Cameron? At its fundamental core, “Cameron” is about making tough choices to be authentic; a definite thematic thread in Johnson’s life. . “I didn’t know I was going to write about a transgendered boy, the words just came out and I thought, ‘Oh, this is about someone trying be someone they don’t appear to be,’” she reveals. “There is a sensation I get when I want to create. I have energy coursing through my veins, and I just let my hands fall and run with it. I don’t always know the initial reference point, but then I go back and make sense of what I’m saying. It’s pure subconscious inspiration and relentless editing. ‘Cameron’ ended up being inspired by a transgendered kid I’m close with, but the song also captures the need to feel at home in your own skin.” Jillette Johnson got signed to Wind-up on the strength of “Cameron.” “That song was a turning point. Talent makes people notice you, but songs bring people to action,” she figures. Inking a deal was the culmination of many years of steadfast pursuit of her ideals and her dream to be a professional musician. “I was convinced by the age of 4 I was going to be a rock star,” she says with a smile. At 6 Johnson began taking piano lessons, and by 8 she was writing her own songs. Her formative influences were the Les Misérables Soundtrack and artists such as Joni Mitchell, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Carole King, and Sarah McLachlan. “I learned song structure from those beautifully articulate songwriters. Joni said so much with quirky lyrics, Carole had a way of simplifying—those two parallels formed me as a lyricist.” At 18 she left her small town of Pound Ridge, New York, population 4,000, to move to NYC’s vibrantly creative Loho neighborhood. From 12-18 she had been making migratory visits to soak up the city’s buzzing inspiration, but her move cemented a creative relationship between her youth, the city, and her soulful compositions. The EP also features highlights like the elegant and stirring “When The Ship Goes Down,” and the buoyant and heartfelt “Torpedo.” “Pauvre Coeur” juxtaposes gorgeously spare classical-flavored piano against bluntly confessional lyrics about a dried up romantic relationship. It’s one of the most arresting moments on the EP. Here Johnson sings: If I recall it was a Friday / Gentle hum before the war / You were high and watching poker / And I had just walked in the door / You started screaming at the TV / Saying, make a play you filthy whore / And I was trying to make you see me / Like the way you did before. “I wrote that from a perspective of strength. I haven’t been in a lot of relationships—the longest has been my music career. Music comes first, anything that got in the way suffered. This was about my first serious adult relationship. It became emotionally abusive as it reached the end, and I lost myself. When I rediscovered myself, I found the strength to leave,” she reveals. The EP and the upcoming album, were produced by Peter Zizzo, widely respected for developing Vanessa Carlton and Avril Lavigne, and Michael Mangini, esteemed for his work with Joss Stone, Bruce Hornsby, and David Byrne. The duo’s innate understanding of Johnson’s singular vision, and respect for her fully-formed compositions helped them enhance the power and dynamics of the music. “They maintained the spirit of the songs—they still are a 100% my songs—they’re just turned way up on the amp,” she says. Reflectively, Jillette Johnson says: “I have a specific point of view and I follow my instincts. My sensibility has been in tune with my emotions. I’m always honest with what I feel. I’m passionate with my songs to a fault.”","<p>On August 14th singer-songwriter Jillette Johnson releases the smoldering and passionate debut EP Whiskey & Frosting (Wind-up Records).

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/young-guns","YOUNG GUNS","High Wycombe, UK","rock, hardcore, alternative rock, post-hardcore","Over the course of the past few years, the London-based YOUNG GUNS have emerged as one of the UK’s most electrifying new bands, garnering heavy radio play and UK chart success, while playing to packed-house crowds all across Europe, including a main stage performance at the Reading Festival, where they tore up the stage as part of a lineup that included Arcade Fire, Queens of the Stone Age, Guns N’ Roses and Modest Mouse.New album BONES has already achieved critical acclaim overseas, with Q Magazine and Kerrang! each giving it four stars and the latter writing that the album sees the band “giving themselves the best shot possible of taking on all comers and winning.” BONES and its title track were also nominated for “Best Album” and “Best Single” as part of this year’s 2012 Kerrang! Awards.“We’ve written something that I feel happy describing as ‘brave,’” says Young Guns frontman Gustav Wood, “and it will challenge a lot of people’s preconceptions about what sort of band we are. It’s an ambitious record, and we have the ambition to match the sound.”Written over a number of months in places ranging from Thailand to Spain to a shed in the band’s hometown of High Wycombe, UK, BONES marks Young Guns’ transition from a band packed with potential to bonafide contenders for the title of Britain’s best. It’s a stirring album full of contradictions – it speaks of strength and vulnerability, friendship and loss, energetic youth and heavy-hearted experience – that proudly displays Wood, John Taylor (guitar), Fraser Taylor (guitar), Simon Mitchell (bass) and Ben Jolliffe (drums)‘s skyscraping vision and style.“When you’re writing an album you need to believe that what you’re doing is the most important thing in the world,” continues Gustav. Having formed from the ashes of a variety of local bands, Young Guns’ first release was the striking Mirrors EP in June 2009. But it wasn’t until debut album All Our Kings Are Dead, unveiled in July 2010, that they began to really show what they were capable of. Backed by a groundswell of popular support, the band hit magazine covers, headlined the HMV Forum in London, toured Australia and played the Main Stage at Reading and Leeds Festivals; in the backs of their minds, though, they knew they could do better. And they were right.Taken at face value, BONES feels effortless, but the work that went into it – the long hours, the nudging back of immutable deadlines, the worry, the sheer grind that comes with a genuinely democratic writing process – mirrors the band’s career to date. This is a story of victory by inches, not of instant boom (and inevitable, sad bust).Young Guns backed themselves into a corner with their drive to comprehensively outdo All Our Kings Are Dead. After a handful of fruitless writing sessions, Gustav, Fraser and John spent a night in the studio with a couple of bottles of vodka and the desire to write a song their heroes would be proud of; when morning eventually came, they had the skeleton of “Dearly Departed,” a song that, once they’d taken it to the rest of the band and let them work their magic, would sit as one of the keystones of BONES. “Once we wrote that song, we knew we could really make a mark with this album,” says Wood. The title track itself is another standout moment, a pure rock anthem in the most heroic sense.“When you do something you know is good, that you know stands up… it’s bliss. Elation. We worked so hard on this album, and there were times when the stress was horrendous. When I finished tracking the vocals for ‘Bones’ and we stood back and cranked it on the stereo at 4am, listening to what I knew would be a single that would do big things for us, that was overwhelming.”From then on, the songs flowed: the title track, a howl of defiance; stunning opener “I Was Born, I Have Lived, I Will Surely Die,” a fearless statement of intent; lead single “Learn My Lesson,” a calling-card that’s as dynamic as it is catchy.“It feels like I want to just kick people’s heads off,” smiles Gustav. “It sounds stupid but I just want to get out there and make a mark – it keeps me up at night, thinking about how much I want to do.”","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">Over the course of the past few years, the London-based <span class=""caps"">YOUNG</span> <span class=""caps"">GUNS</span> have emerged as one of the UK’s most electrifying new bands, garnering heavy radio play and UK chart success, while playing to packed-house crowds all across Europe, including a main stage performance at the Reading Festival, where they tore up the stage as part of a lineup that included Arcade Fire, Queens of the Stone Age, Guns N</span><span style=""display: inline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">’ Roses and Modest Mouse.<br><br>New album <span class=""caps"">BONES</span> has already achieved critical acclaim overseas, with Q Magazine and Kerrang! each giving it four stars and the latter writing that the album sees the band “giving themselves the best shot possible of taking on all comers and winning.” <span class=""caps"">BONES</span> and its title track were also nominated for “Best Album” and “Best Single” as part of this year’s 2012 Kerrang!

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-trews","The Trews","Canada","rock, alternative, indie rock, alternative rock, canadian","The Trews are a Canadian rock group from Antigonish, Nova Scotia, consisting of vocalist Colin MacDonald, guitarist John-Angus MacDonald, bassist Jack Syperek, and drummer Sean Dalton. The band are currently based in Niagara Falls, Ontario. The band started off with the name One I’d Trouser, before changing their name to Trouser and eventually The Trews. They released an EP as Trouser, and a second EP under the name ""The Trews."" In the early summer of 2002 the band was selected to take part in the 97.7 HTZ FM Rock Search, a high profile contest that is held annually by the Southern Ontario rock radio station. Winning the contest would prove to their big break as they soon landed a recording contract with Sony-BMG Canada. The release of their first full-length CD House of Ill Fame in 2003, soon followed.

After the better part of a year, the group released an EP entitled The April Storm. This record caught the ear of acclaimed Halifax guitar hero Joel Plaskett, who immediately offered to produce the groups first full-length album. When not breaking Erlenmeyer flasks, the group managed to pen and record a twelve-song eponymous album that blurs the line between alt-country and power pop. Unabashedly catchy and sincere, Two Hours Traffic is deservedly at the fore of the Canadian Maritime pop revival. Recorded while the band was still in their teens, Two Hours Traffic recalls the eccentricity of The Cars and the immediacy of Big Star. People took to the songs without hesitation: Limelight fueled some hottub drama on The OC, Better Sorry Than Safe edged out indie-rock mainstays Broken Social Scene and The Constantines on CBC Radio 3’s 2005 year-end list, and the album was nominated for Best Rock Recording at the 2006 East Coast Music Awards. While their debut album was a magnet for critical accolades, their peers took notice as well. THT has toured Eastern Canada extensively with the likes of Wintersleep, The Joel Plaskett Emergency, and Cuff the Duke. Now, Two Hours Traffic have completed their second EP, Isolator. Having triumphed over the dreaded sophomore slump, the band continues to prove that science kids can make great art. Armed with an arsenal of new songs, Two Hours Traffic gladly leaves behind the ivory towers of higher education for less dignified pursuits.
