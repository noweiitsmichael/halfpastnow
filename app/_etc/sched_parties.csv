All visitors to Hackney House Austin are welcome to paint and play, using bespoke software on touch tablets with tuition from Daniel Hirschmann, from 2-4pm every day during SXSWi 2013. 
Engine26 by Daniel Hirschmann is part of the ongoing experimentation and development of the generative painting genre of new media artwork.

The software is written to allow for the gestural manipulation of live video and the output of a ﾑpaintedﾒ moment in time.
