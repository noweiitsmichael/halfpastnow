Zazoo has introduced a revolutionary new web application that embeds an artist's unique ‘Mini App’ onto each music video, wherever it is watched.

They became foster parents in 1992 and it was through this experience that Ray realized these youth needed more positive opportunities to help them grow into productive citizens. Ray was a life long musician; he knew the benefits of engaging in a music program and he saw few music opportunities for these youth.|He decided to start a music program for foster kids; any child that had the desire would be provided a guitar and free lessons. On July 24, 2000 Guitars not Guns was incorporated and became a federally exempt 501(c) (3) non-profit. Shortly thereafter they started their first guitar class with two volunteer teachers in San Jose, California. Over the next few years classes expanded to neighboring Counties in California and the program expanded to include any youth living in adverse circumstances who lacked the means to participate in a music program. In 2006 the program started spreading outside of California; today GnG’s Music Program is operating in several states and Canada.|Guitars not Guns Virginia was chartered as a GnG Affiliate in June 2006; Guitars not Guns Maryland and Guitars not Guns Washington D.C. were chartered as GnG Affiliates in April 2009. Virginia, Maryland and DC operate jointly asGnG NCA (Guitars Not Guns of the National Capital Area). Collectively we operate 32 teaching locations and serve over 300 youth annually. New locations are being opened as volunteers and funds are found to operate them.|More (delicious and sweet) details to follow soon.|+ in.sessions w/ in.gredients (@ store!)|http://www.in.gredients.com/|http://in.gredients.com/in-sessions/ |(the in.sessions are really special!!!)","<div class=""wysiwyg-text-align-left""><span><span class=""wysiwyg-color-red"">Free Entry with RSVP on Do512! </span><br><br>GnG Presents: West 6th Street Block Party ""Delicious Showcases"" - Day Four @ J.

They became foster parents in 1992 and it was through this experience that Ray realized these youth needed more positive opportunities to help them grow into productive citizens. Ray was a life long musician; he knew the benefits of engaging in a music program and he saw few music opportunities for these youth.|He decided to start a music program for foster kids; any child that had the desire would be provided a guitar and free lessons. On July 24, 2000 Guitars not Guns was incorporated and became a federally exempt 501(c) (3) non-profit. Shortly thereafter they started their first guitar class with two volunteer teachers in San Jose, California. Over the next few years classes expanded to neighboring Counties in California and the program expanded to include any youth living in adverse circumstances who lacked the means to participate in a music program.

They became foster parents in 1992 and it was through this experience that Ray realized these youth needed more positive opportunities to help them grow into productive citizens. Ray was a life long musician; he knew the benefits of engaging in a music program and he saw few music opportunities for these youth.<br><br>He decided to start a music program for foster kids; any child that had the desire would be provided a guitar and free lessons. On July 24, 2000 Guitars not Guns was incorporated and became a federally exempt 501(c) (3) non-profit. Shortly thereafter they started their first guitar class with two volunteer teachers in San Jose, California. Over the next few years classes expanded to neighboring Counties in California and the program expanded to include any youth living in adverse circumstances who lacked the means to participate in a music program. In 2006 the program started spreading outside of California; today GnG’s Music Program is operating in several states and Canada.<br><br>Guitars not Guns Virginia was chartered as a GnG Affiliate in June 2006; Guitars not Guns Maryland and Guitars not Guns Washington D.C. were chartered as GnG Affiliates in April 2009.

The melody intoxicates the listeners by allowing them to form their own relationship and attachment with the songs.|http://www.andrewduncanbrown.com/|Avery:|Avery formed in March of 2011 by Allison Galbreath and Mariah DeRaet. After playing together for a couple months Brad Mitchell joined the mix and changed the game by further producing their simplistic stylings with slide guitars and ambient lead parts. In July of 2012 some heavier percussion was needed and Eric Estrada was happy to oblige.|www.reverbnation.com/averyaz|Bad Lucy:|The trio of J. Miller, Alex Kyhn and Alex Lee are an amalgamation of differing influences that meld into their unique style known for its nuance, use of space and surprising harmonies. J. Miller pulls heavily from his folk sensibilities when writing and performing, while bassist Alex Kyhn brings to the fold a mix of jazz and soul. Drummer Alex Lee’s marching and rock roots add the final layer.|Officially formed in March 2011, the band showcased their sounds on a self-titled release in May 2012. The debut, which was recorded live to tape, came on the heels of a year of highs for the band including the broadcast of their single “Forward” on the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. The song was also a “homegrown hit” on the local, Phoenix airwaves.|Known for “sounding just like the recording” during their live performances, the band often silences a room within minutes. A reviewer/blogger, that was first introduced to the band via a live stream, sums it up best: ""The band is called Bad Lucy, and their gorgeous, melodic songs and energetic live show blasted right through the off-kilter webcam and livestream hiccups—and into my heart. Shut up, I’m serious.""|www.badlucyband.com|Captain Squeegee:|""The Gods of Music are not dead! They are coming out of retirement for this young group brimming with talent, enthusiasm, and freshness"" (French-Webzine ""Progressia""). In a world strangled by mediocrity and distraction, Captain Squeegee leads a legacy to push the boundaries of music and bend the rules of the industry itself. Since their mysterious formation in 2003, they have allowed fate to arrange their current line-up (no original members), which has since performed hundreds of shows and festivals, released two albums, and manifested multiple music videos. Even before birthing their internationally acclaimed full length, Nothing vs Everything (2008), the band has made numerous journeys across the southwest with an intent to infect the people with their unique sound and offer something seriously different to the artistic community. Their progressive blend of multi-instrumentation and conceptualized orchestrations have been described as ""Fantasia music, with lead singer Danny Torgersen making like Mickey in a swirling maelstrom of flying horns, dancing guitars, broken melodies, and mad-prophet vocalizing"" (Phoenix New Times), and was even awarded ""Best album of 2008"" and ""Best hope of 2009"" by French Webzine-""Progressia"". Recently, they have paired up with the ""Lucidity Web-Saga"" as actors and musicians, even writing it's theme song, ""Your Own Invention"", which they recorded in a pyramid. Forever in stark contrast to the robotic, zombie infested waters of the mass media and mainstream, Squeegee will continue to offer a new age perspective, driving their fans and future fans to open the mind's eye (and ear)... and ""See More Clearly"".|www.captainsqueegee.com|Danger Paul:|Danger Paul consists of Paul Balazs (guitar/vocals), Calin Gross (guitar/lap steel slide), Keith Fama (bass), and Ari Leopold (drums). With a wide variety of influence the only simple working description is JAZZ GRUNGE.|http://dangerpaul.bandcamp.com/|Japhy’s Descent:|Japhy's Descent is about planting seeds to watch our community grow. Music has brought us & those around us so much joy, that we wish to share that love with the world around us. Brian, Martin, James & Travis wish to invite you to take the plunge into the wonderful world around you. Listen to music, laugh, play, love, share, & experience the awe around you by simply being apart of it. Remember... ""You can't fall off a mountain"".|www.reverbnation.com/japhysdescent|Field Tripp:|Field Tripp is an American alternative rock band based in Phoenix, AZ. The band was formed in 2007 as a three-piece by songwriters Dan Allmond, Jonathon Smith, and Matthew Newcomb. The trio released one self-titled 5 song EP in late 2007. Field Tripp's roster has changed frequently, with only singer/guitarist Dan Allmond remaining from the original lineup. Since mid 2011 the other members include multi-instrumentalists Eliz Christy and Brian Mabry with Amir Azzabi on drums. The band has developed a reputation for their raw yet poppy sound, use of unconventional instruments, and strong songwriting. Field Tripp released their first full length album entitled Super-Ego Friendly in 2011 and is currently recording their second album due for release in Summer 2013.|www.reverbnation.com/fieldtripp|Frequent Kings:|Frequent Kings originally started with Glenn Nishida and WuT then migrated to WuT and Kamakane who Met in Hawaii through a musical mutual friend. “ Now......

Miller, Alex Kyhn and Alex Lee are an amalgamation of differing influences that meld into their unique style known for its nuance, use of space and surprising harmonies. J. Miller pulls heavily from his folk sensibilities when writing and performing, while bassist Alex Kyhn brings to the fold a mix of jazz and soul. Drummer Alex Lee’s marching and rock roots add the final layer.<br><br>Officially formed in March 2011, the band showcased their sounds on a self-titled release in May 2012. The debut, which was recorded live to tape, came on the heels of a year of highs for the band including the broadcast of their single “Forward” on the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. The song was also a “homegrown hit” on the local, Phoenix airwaves.<br><br>Known for “sounding just like the recording” during their live performances, the band often silences a room within minutes. A reviewer/blogger, that was first introduced to the band via a live stream, sums it up best: ""The band is called Bad Lucy, and their gorgeous, melodic songs and energetic live show blasted right through the off-kilter webcam and livestream hiccups—and into my heart. Shut up, I’m serious.""<br><a href=""http://www.badlucyband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.badlucyband.com</a><br><br>Captain Squeegee:<br>""The Gods of Music are not dead! They are coming out of retirement for this young group brimming with talent, enthusiasm, and freshness"" (French-Webzine ""Progressia""). In a world strangled by mediocrity and distraction, Captain Squeegee leads a legacy to push the boundaries of music and bend the rules of the industry itself. Since their mysterious formation in 2003, they have allowed fate to arrange their current line-up (no original members), which has since performed hundreds of shows and festivals, released two albums, and manifested multiple music videos. Even before birthing their internationally acclaimed full length, Nothing vs Everything (2008), the band has made numerous journeys across the southwest with an intent to infect the people with their unique sound and offer something seriously different to the artistic community. Their progressive blend of multi-instrumentation and conceptualized orchestrations have been described as ""Fantasia music, with lead singer Danny Torgersen making like Mickey in a swirling maelstrom of flying horns, dancing guitars, broken melodies, and mad-prophet vocalizing"" (Phoenix New Times), and was even awarded ""Best album of 2008"" and ""Best hope of 2009"" by French Webzine-""Progressia"". Recently, they have paired up with the ""Lucidity Web-Saga"" as actors and musicians, even writing it's theme song, ""Your Own Invention"", which they recorded in a pyramid. Forever in stark contrast to the robotic, zombie infested waters of the mass media and mainstream, Squeegee will continue to offer a new age perspective, driving their fans and future fans to open the mind's eye (and ear)... and ""See More Clearly"".<br><a href=""http://www.captainsqueegee.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.captainsqueegee.com</a><br><br>Danger Paul:<br>Danger Paul consists of Paul Balazs (guitar/vocals), Calin Gross (guitar/lap steel slide), Keith Fama (bass), and Ari Leopold (drums).

We’re looking forward to expanding this showcase of the outstanding people and ideas that help make NYC one of the best places to start, build, and expand a business.”|Katherine Oliver, Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, said, “New York City is a thriving center of creativity, from the surge of films and television shows produced here to the growth of digital startups based in the City that are reinventing the way we live our lives. New York City has so much to offer, and we’re thrilled to be able to showcase the many talented New Yorkers who will be a part of Made in NY: Austin.”Rachel Haot, Chief Digital Officer of New York City said, “The City of New York is home to not only the world’s most innovative tech minds and businesses but also those on the forefront of art, culture, and food. We’re ecstatic to work with NY Tech Meetup to make this a true New York experience in Austin, and it’s sure to be a blast.”|David Rose, CEO of Gust said: “It’s going to be great to be back in Austin to repeat the amazing showcase of New York’s tech industry that took place last year. Gust has continued to power deal flow management tools and investor relations for NYC-area startups, venture funds, and angel groups, and we can’t wait to do it again at Made in NY: Austin.”|Last year’s event, which featured more than 45 New York tech startups, received outstanding reviews from over 1,000 attendees (with another 2,000 on the waiting list). While sponsors for the event are still being confirmed, previous sponsors include Buddy Media, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, DFJ Gotham Ventures, Shapeways, Rapp, Etsy, and Tumblr.|The all-day and evening event will include interactive and experiential installations of New York’s best technology along with pitch sessions, workshops, and a high-tech, high-energy party to cap off the night.

The event, expected to attract over 2,000 attendees, will celebrate the vast resources, diverse talent, and unique cultural inspiration of New York tech, culture, food, film, art and music.</p><p><br></p><p>Jessica Lawrence, Managing Director of NY Tech Meetup said, “Last year’s event was such a huge success for the entire NYC start-up community and everyone who attended. We’re looking forward to expanding this showcase of the outstanding people and ideas that help make NYC one of the best places to start, build, and expand a business.”</p><p><br></p><p>Katherine Oliver, Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, said, “New York City is a thriving center of creativity, from the surge of films and television shows produced here to the growth of digital startups based in the City that are reinventing the way we live our lives. New York City has so much to offer, and we’re thrilled to be able to showcase the many talented New Yorkers who will be a part of Made in NY: Austin.”</p><p>Rachel Haot, Chief Digital Officer of New York City said, “The City of New York is home to not only the world’s most innovative tech minds and businesses but also those on the forefront of art, culture, and food. We’re ecstatic to work with NY Tech Meetup to make this a true New York experience in Austin, and it’s sure to be a blast.”</p><p><br></p><p>David Rose, CEO of Gust said: “It’s going to be great to be back in Austin to repeat the amazing showcase of New York’s tech industry that took place last year. Gust has continued to power deal flow management tools and investor relations for NYC-area startups, venture funds, and angel groups, and we can’t wait to do it again at Made in NY: Austin.”</p><p><br></p><p>Last year’s event, which featured more than 45 New York tech startups, received outstanding reviews from over 1,000 attendees (with another 2,000 on the waiting list). While sponsors for the event are still being confirmed, previous sponsors include Buddy Media, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, DFJ Gotham Ventures, Shapeways, Rapp, Etsy, and Tumblr.</p><p><br></p><p>The all-day and evening event will include interactive and experiential installations of New York’s best technology along with pitch sessions, workshops, and a high-tech, high-energy party to cap off the night. The state-of-the-art venue will also include the popular arts+tech interactive #FEED installations, powered by Twitter. </p><p><br></p><p>The event is free and open to the public but does require an RSVP.

As an official SXSW event, our event will be promoted through SXSW official marketing channels to over 40,000 attendees.</p><p><br></p><p>The event, which will be open to all SXSW Interactive + Film badge-holders, event partners and VIPs, will feature a full evening of SXSW-style mixing and mingling including: an exclusive VIP pre-party with national investors, celebrities and Pittsburgh innovators; an interactive arcade with the newest projects from Pittsburgh companies and students; live VJ, with music and video remixes of Pittsburgh’s innovation successes, and a circulation of up to 30,000 national and international conference attendees. Because SXSW is the preeminent event for business and technology innovation, the conference is the ideal place to raise awareness of Pittsburgh’s innovation – and reinvention, as well as reinforce the opportunities which exist and are promulgating in this region. This year’s SXSW Film and Interactive event is slated to attract over 40,000 conference-goers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>There are many ways to get involved!

Join in to our merry crew of startup entrepreneurs. We have accommodation. We have Trade Show booth. We have Interactive or Platinum badges. We have Mobile Monday. We have tons of parties to go to. We have seminars. We have BBQ. We can have it all. The 2nd batch of SXSW registrations opened, open until Feb 8 (one month before the event) or until we run out of space at our ClubHouse and/or our booth. However, January 18th is the deadline for all the materials and participating company information under the Nest Helsinki booth, so if for Startup or Business pack, be sure to act before that! Questions - get in touch, details below! /Peter ***************************************************************************** SXSW®, South by Southwest®, is happening again in March, 2013 (8th-17th) in Austin, Texas Peter Green from MobileSensing/GreenFly Events is taking Finnish startups over to Austin again next year, for the fourth time. Double booth and accommodation for the first ones (approx 30 peeps) confirmed. Flights are not included, but pretty much everything else is. More to come when needed. Few words about the SXSW and then to the packages: (Note, if viewing this on iPad/mobile device, the price shown is with Finnish VAT included) SXSW® offers the unique convergence of original music, independent films, and emerging technologies. Fostering creative and professional growth alike, SXSW® is the premier destination for discovery. The SXSWi, South by Southwest Interactive, will be organized for 20th time (SXSW music festival for the 27th time). The Interactive part is between March 8-12 and Music between 12-17. Film goes on all the time. Earlier this year Peter Green (original FinnMobster since 2009) had over 20 startups going to the event of close to 50.000 attendees, with a SXSW Trade Show booth (among about 300 other exhibitors). Many of us were also staying at a group accommodation at the FinnMob Clubhouse. 2013 will be the fourth SXSW organized by Peter, this again bigger and better than before, in 2010 we had about 10 Finns over to SXSW, in 2011 about 50. This year there were close to 100 - and according to the booth pitch the aim in 2013 is 200 companies. So, we are doing a share towards that 200 right here! Join in to Suomi @SXSW2013 crew - let's make sure there will be the 200 Finns this time (and maybe few Swedes with us, too:) The packages are planned to suite well for start-ups, and includes either Interactive or Platinum (withMusic and Film) badge, Group accommodation in a SuomiSXSW Clubhouse (beers and breakfast available; B&B&B:), Trade Show booth/stand as a ""homebase"" during the Interactive part (Trade Show deom Sunday 10th until Wednesday 13th). Also various side events are being planned (with sponsorship and visibility for Startup packs and especially Business packs). For the Business Pack there is also possibility to use a local PR agency for press releases and press tours during the Trade Show as well as Promotions by a professional promotion company. These packs (and specific prices) will be specified later (sorry about that!) These package prices are valid until end of November (sorry, could not stretch the deadlines more) and there's a maximum quantity of 20 Evangelist-, 20 Startups- and 10 Business- packs at this stage. But yes, the aim is the 200, so this will be extendable, with more houses, RV's and extended booth space if demand exceeds the supply. The packages are explained underneath the selections above, please note that for the evangelist pack there's only one person per company allowed. Also, there is a good opportunity to make this SuomiSXSW 2013 event as part of TEM support (Finnish Ministry of Employment anf the Economy) program for Finnish export.

Join in to our merry crew of startup entrepreneurs. We have accommodation. We have Trade Show booth. We have Interactive or Platinum badges. We have Mobile Monday. We have tons of parties to go to. We have seminars. We have BBQ. We can have it all. The 2nd batch of SXSW registrations opened, open until Feb 8 (one month before the event) or until we run out of space at our ClubHouse and/or our booth. However, January 18th is the deadline for all the materials and participating company information under the Nest Helsinki booth, so if for Startup or Business pack, be sure to act before that! Questions - get in touch, details below! /Peter ***************************************************************************** SXSW®, South by Southwest®, is happening again in March, 2013 (8th-17th) in Austin, Texas Peter Green from MobileSensing/GreenFly Events is taking Finnish startups over to Austin again next year, for the fourth time. Double booth and accommodation for the first ones (approx 30 peeps) confirmed. Flights are not included, but pretty much everything else is. More to come when needed. Few words about the SXSW and then to the packages: (Note, if viewing this on iPad/mobile device, the price shown is with Finnish VAT included) SXSW® offers the unique convergence of original music, independent films, and emerging technologies. Fostering creative and professional growth alike, SXSW® is the premier destination for discovery. The SXSWi, South by Southwest Interactive, will be organized for 20th time (SXSW music festival for the 27th time). The Interactive part is between March 8-12 and Music between 12-17. Film goes on all the time. Earlier this year Peter Green (original FinnMobster since 2009) had over 20 startups going to the event of close to 50.000 attendees, with a SXSW Trade Show booth (among about 300 other exhibitors). Many of us were also staying at a group accommodation at the FinnMob Clubhouse. 2013 will be the fourth SXSW organized by Peter, this again bigger and better than before, in 2010 we had about 10 Finns over to SXSW, in 2011 about 50. This year there were close to 100 - and according to the booth pitch the aim in 2013 is 200 companies. So, we are doing a share towards that 200 right here! Join in to Suomi @SXSW2013 crew - let's make sure there will be the 200 Finns this time (and maybe few Swedes with us, too:) The packages are planned to suite well for start-ups, and includes either Interactive or Platinum (withMusic and Film) badge, Group accommodation in a SuomiSXSW Clubhouse (beers and breakfast available; B&B&B:), Trade Show booth/stand as a ""homebase"" during the Interactive part (Trade Show deom Sunday 10th until Wednesday 13th). Also various side events are being planned (with sponsorship and visibility for Startup packs and especially Business packs). For the Business Pack there is also possibility to use a local PR agency for press releases and press tours during the Trade Show as well as Promotions by a professional promotion company. These packs (and specific prices) will be specified later (sorry about that!) These package prices are valid until end of November (sorry, could not stretch the deadlines more) and there's a maximum quantity of 20 Evangelist-, 20 Startups- and 10 Business- packs at this stage. But yes, the aim is the 200, so this will be extendable, with more houses, RV's and extended booth space if demand exceeds the supply. The packages are explained underneath the selections above, please note that for the evangelist pack there's only one person per company allowed. Also, there is a good opportunity to make this SuomiSXSW 2013 event as part of TEM support (Finnish Ministry of Employment anf the Economy) program for Finnish export. If so, there will be an approximate 40-50% refund of all the event related travel- and marketing expenditures afterwards, including the package price, travel and other direct costs.

We think Operation Every Band might just be onto something here... |On March 12, ""We are a Sad Band"" is playing at The Main according to the official SX schedule BUT no band with that name seems to exist. Here's Operation Every Band's reasoning that it's ACTUALLY Thom Yorke: |Every year, there seems to be something that doesn’t quite look right on the SXSW roster. Many times, this ends up being a surprise show of some sort, an event many know takes place all over Austin. After looking through Spotify, I’ll normally hit Google to begin my research. We Are a Sad Band, who are apparently a funk band from “Sadville” , Texas (their website is listed as http://sxsw.com), came up with zero online references and currently sits alone on the schedule for Tuesday night at The Main...|Nate Headden, OEB writer and resident sleuth, put together a solid case that We Are A Sad Band is none other than Thom Yoke’s Atoms for Peace. Again, this is purely a rumor at this point, but some interesting notes:| - If this is a secret show, then the artist would have to be a pretty big name to necessitate a non-listed showcase, especially off the official SXSW roster.| - We Are A Sad Band has a tongue-in-cheek tone to it. Who would be a band that may be hastily called a “sad band” by press? Radiohead ended up being the first name we called out.| - A secret SXSW showcase would normally coincide with a major release. Radiohead hasn’t been in the studio, but Yorke’s Atoms For Peace is releasing AMOK next week.| - Yorke and Nigel Godrich recently inferred there will be some tour dates coming soon in a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session this week.| - And our smoking gun. While AMOK is being released next week, a 12” is set to follow in the UK on March 11, which would mean a US release should coincide with March 12, the day of the showcase. Not only that, the 12” will also contain a non-album B-side. The name of the B-side: SAD.|Do512 will keep you up to date!

We Are a Sad Band, who are apparently a funk band from “Sadville” , Texas (their website is listed as <a href=""http://sxsw.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://sxsw.com</a>), came up with zero online references and currently sits alone on the schedule for Tuesday night at The Main...<br><br>Nate Headden, OEB writer and resident sleuth, put together a solid case that We Are A Sad Band is none other than <strong>Thom Yoke’s Atoms for Peace</strong>. Again, this is purely a rumor at this point, but some interesting notes:<br> - If this is a secret show, then the artist would have to be a pretty big name to necessitate a non-listed showcase, especially off the official SXSW roster.<br> - We Are A Sad Band has a tongue-in-cheek tone to it. Who would be a band that may be hastily called a “sad band” by press? Radiohead ended up being the first name we called out.<br> - A secret SXSW showcase would normally coincide with a major release. Radiohead hasn’t been in the studio, but Yorke’s Atoms For Peace is releasing AMOK next week.<br> - Yorke and Nigel Godrich recently inferred there <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/atoms-for-peace-release-amok-stream-hint-at-more-u-s-tour-dates-20130218"" target=""_blank"">will be some tour dates coming soon</a> in a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session this week.<br> - And our smoking gun. While AMOK is being released next week, a 12” is set to follow in the UK on March 11, which would mean a US release should coincide with March 12, the day of the showcase. Not only that, the 12” will also contain a non-album B-side. The name of the B-side: <a href=""http://www.xlrecordings.com/news/listentojudgejuryandexecutioner"" target=""_blank"">SAD</a>.<br><br><br><br><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-black"">Do512 will keep you up to date!

We can use our phone to watch on-demand programming.|When the power goes out, we may get a text notification from our fridge. If you're higher tech, the grocery list can transfer easily through your wireless network from your Smart Fridge to any device. Convergence and interconnection are the new name of the game, and along with apps and wireless networking, several revolutionary interconnection technologies will soon change every detail of our lives - forever.|This is the Internet of Things - a future where people and objects communicate in unprecedented ways. In this panel we'll explore the dynamics of interconnection and convergence and address the need for a more interdisciplinary approach to design, engineering, development, communication and privacy. Questions AnsweredIn real terms, what is the ""Internet of Things"" and is it just a buzzword?What are the big social changes we might predict as millions of users effectively imprint the Internet onto our physical environments?We can all see that more of our devices, tools and toys are becoming connected in ways we never imagined even 5 years ago. What benefits can connectivity and convergence bring to society and culture? How can these benefits support support developing countries and building a more sustainable world?As we move towards a world of very realistic interaction with physically remote experiences, what are the implications on our personal relationships, geography, careers, privacy and personal identity?Even with all this convergence and connection, there are moments where I want to be by myself, or just share with a couple of people. If I don’t want others to know what I am doing and where I am, how can I ensure the privacy and proper partitioning of my information? Will sharing be ""the norm"" or my choice?|Presented by:|Joe Weinman, Sr VP, Telx |Oleg Logvinov, Dir Market Dev Industrial & Power Conversion Division, STMicroelectronicsWael Diab, Sr Technical Dir, BroadcomKaren Bartleson, Sr. Director, Community Marketing, Synosys and IEEE-SA President|Hashtags:|#sxsw #DigTel|via Eventbrite","<p><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;""><img width=""480"" alt=""SXSW IEEE Digital Telepathy Internet of Things Panel"" src=""https://evbdn.eventbrite.com/s3-s3/eventlogos/49293976/digitaltelepathy.jpg"" height=""320""></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"">Once upon a time, our phone, the fridge and TV were distinct devices, manufactured in distinctly different environments.

As the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, he has used his personal Twitter feed to interact with constituents on an hourly basis; to follow @CoryBooker is to understand the daily challenge of leading one of America’s largest cities. The mayor is routinely responding to questions and complaints – about issues ranging from potholes to snowdrifts and neighborhood violence. When not personally investigating an issue, he forwards phone numbers and e-mail addresses to his followers, directing residents to various city agencies. He endorses city businesses, shares inspirational quotes, responds directly to tweets of joy or frustration from his followers – and just last night shared his unabashed love for all things “Star Trek.”|In an age of media advisors, pollsters and strategists, when most politicians appear only in carefully scripted settings, Mayor Booker has used Twitter to defy the norm, opening himself up to candid, continuous (and some might say relentless) contact with those he governs. In 2012, he also aggressively used his social feeds to respond to the fallout of Superstorm Sandy, which left New Jersey in a state of emergency, and used his personal Twitter feed to offer hourly updates on his widely-publicized week-long Food Stamp Challenge.|What has Mayor Booker learned about his community through their RT’s and DM’s? Have his online interactions led to shifts in policy or priorities? How does he see social media reshaping what it means to lead and govern in the 21st century? Alternatively, does he see any risks, in becoming so engaged with residents who tweet that he loses sight of the citizens without a Twitter handle?|And as the mayor considers a 2014 senate bid, does he believe that a Senator Booker could be every bit as open and candid via social media as Mayor Booker has been?|via SX Interactive","<div class=""wysiwyg-text-align-center""><span style=""font: inherit; color: rgb(40, 45, 46);""><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large"">A Conversation between Mayor Cory Booker and </span></span><a href=""https://twitter.com/TheSnydes""><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large"">Steven James Snyder</span></a><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large""> </span><span style=""font: inherit; color: rgb(40, 45, 46);"" class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large"">of </span><a href=""http://entertainment.time.com/author/stevos23/""><span class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large"">TIME</span></a><span style=""font: inherit; color: rgb(40, 45, 46);"" class=""wysiwyg-font-size-large""> </span></div><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span class=""wysiwyg-color-black"">Few politicians use social media as openly, or prolifically, as </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/CoryBooker""><span class=""wysiwyg-color-black"">Cory Booker</span></a><span class=""wysiwyg-color-black"">.

For four days only, Hackney House Austin will transform a 3,000+ sq ft space on 6th Street into the ultimate Hackney-inspired workshop space. Through a carefully curated programme of Art, Design, Music, Film, Product and Events, 25 local businesses will have the opportunity to spotlight their work, network with Austin friends, entertain and enlighten, all within an exceptional space. By day, Hackney House Austin will be a welcoming hangout, complete with free WIFI and coffee, meeting spaces, and power chargers. Come by between 10am – 2pm and the space will be filled with a curated programme of short films by Protein, onedotzero and ITV. The Sugru repair shop will be open for business, and you’ll be invited to drop by and pick up your pre-ordered business cards by Moo.
