Gunslinger for The Cramps. Six-string stylist for Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. The legendary Kid Congo Powers titles his new album on INTHERED Records GORILLA ROSE after artist/performer Gorilla Rose. As a teenage boy Kid met Gorilla thru seminal weirdo band, The Screamers in the emerging LA Punk music scene of the 70’s. He recalls, “Gorilla Rose was a close and constant presence and influence on The Screamers and me as a young pup. He was to The Screamers like Bobby Neuwirth was to Dylan, a jester of sorts, sparking many of their great lyric ideas. I still think GORILLA ROSE is the most fabulous nom de plume in history. His unsung specter had been in my mind a lot last year so I decided to title the album GORILLA ROSE to honor his name and bring him into rock n roll’s ongoing conversation.” While editing his fan club newsletters at a haunted Hollywood house, a teenage Kid Congo was also exposed to the sounds of Neu, Nico, Billie Holiday, and the “Susperia” movie soundtrack by Goblin. Along with Gorilla and Kid’s Garage rock pedigree, these past influences found their way back into his new album. For GORILLA ROSE Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds grabbed producer Jason Ward and hightailed it back to the magik gymnasium at The Harveyville Project, a high school in Kansas and also the scene of the crime of their much acclaimed 2009 release “Dracula Boots.” Kiki “El Coyote” Solis on bass and Ron “The Cap’n” Miller on drums along with, new Pink Monkey Bird, Jesse “The Candyman” Roberts (from Seattle’s The Ruby Doe) on guitar, keys and vocals firms up Kid Congo’s squawking flock. Brandishing 13 all original glam-tastic compositions, GORIILA ROSE blasts off with the explosive dance anthem “Bo Bo Boogaloo” wearing their 60’s Chicano Rock influence on their sleeves. Shake it don’t break it! That’s just the start of a wild ride thru funky but chic decadence (“Goldin Browne”) slip sliding rockabilly (“Hills Of Pills”) ,Teenage punkdom (“Our Other World”) mystic Kraut rock (“Bubble Trouble”) , baby-making sleaze (“Catsuit Fruit”), the best bad Peyote trip you ever took ( “Injun War Crimes.”) and even a velvety call from the beyond (Lullaby in Paradise). Finding inspiration in the past is what Kid Congo and The Pink Monkey Birds do best. On this 2011 sonic trip, Kid brings his past into the present and names it after someone flamboyant and inspired.

If I wouldn’t say it to you at a bar, I won’t say it lyrically.”Engineered by vintage aficionado Christopher Hoffee at CHAOS Recorders, Feral Flocks attests to the fact that Davenport’s fire is not fueled by grief and heartache alone. Rather, the band finds an uplifting groove that tells of newfound inspiration.Opening number “Ninjavitus” sets the tone with shimmering keys Greg Theilmann , a whimsical, mock-Orient guitar lead Andrew Armerding, Daniel Gallo’s driven bass lines, and beats backed by the calculating rhythms of Carlos Ortiz from Davenport’s prior outfit, Gun Runner.The band recently completed a video for “Ninjavitus” (directed by Eric Casas) poking fun at the daily promotional chores of just about every contemporary band, which requires everything from internet solicitations to sign spinning skills on a street corner.“Splendor,” continues the coltish resolve with a chorus that, minus the track’s New Wave abandon, could come off as bitter: “Oh, there you go, walking slow, and I need you there.”Instead, it rings of admiration.“Mystifying Oracle” elaborates on Feral Flocks’ quixotic disposition with expansive guitar hooks, ecstatic builds, and a star-crossed breakdown which wonders, “Am I ever gunna wake up where you are?”With a tour on the horizon (first stop, SXSW 2013) and two knockout albums under their belt, there’s no saying where the band will wake up next – but who cares?After all, up here in the Hills, the view is extraordinary.via Facebook","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">With the addition of samples, a couple guitars, and live traps backed by programmed beats, Hills Like Elephants announces their presence on the national scene with a dance-friendly re-imagination of indie rock, lo-fi disco, and what frontman Sean Davenport calls “Motown with drum machines.”</span><br><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">On their sophomore effort, Feral Flocks, San Diego indie soul stalwarts grow from a solo project of keyboard</span><span style=""display: inline; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;""> crooner Davenport (Gun Runner, Abigail Warchild) into a full five-piece band.<br>(Feral Flocks REQ06 Requiemme Records/<span class=""caps"">BMG</span> Chrysalis – March 26, 2013)<br>Only months after the release of their debut The Endless Charade, Hills Like Elephants were crowned Best New Artist at the 2012 San Diego Music Awards and went on to play a series of hometown performances to venues so full, not even Hemmingway could get a drink.<br>“On The Endless Charade, I was harping on the idea of past relationships, but I was also trying to move on,” says Davenport. “Feral Flocks is more about noticing the subtleties of life, but I’m not trying to be profound.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-soft-white-sixties","The Soft White Sixties","San Francisco","","The Soft White Sixties, one of San Francisco’s most talked about bands, have been hailed by some press as legitimate heirs to the Maximum R&B moniker placed on The Who some 40-plus years ago; and while that’s not un-true, The Soft White Sixties offer so much more. Like a perfect collision between the sweetly subversive melodies of T-Rex and the hard-edged pop sensibilities of The Strokes, The Soft White Sixties’ brand of rock ‘n roll blends heavy, soulful grooves with a driving beat.Since releasing their debut EP in April of 2011, The Soft White Sixties have been busy. After immediately filling larger venues in their hometown, from Slim’s to The Great American Music Hall, they were invited to perform at festivals around the country. Over the last year and a half, The Soft White Sixties made appearances at The High Sierra Music Festival in Quincy, CA, The Harmony Festival in Sonoma, CA, The Treefort Music Festival in Boise, ID, CMJ in New York, NY, and SXSW in Austin, TX, where they shared the stages with bands like My Morning Jacket, Dr. Dog, Delta Spirit, and The Flaming Lips. In 2012, The Soft White Sixties successfully completed their first full US tour, going from coast to coast to play 25 shows in 30 days across 16 states. To coincide with the national tour, the band released a 9-episode documentary entitled “Knock It Loose: On The Road with The Soft White Sixties”, covering their first West Coast tour, produced by San Francisco’s own BAMM.tv. You can hear their music regularly spinning on radio stations like Live 105 and KUSF in San Francisco, KEXP in Seattle, WLOY in Maryland, and Radio Boise, and might catch some of their songs currently licensed for film and national television campaigns.With a new record on the horizon produced by Jim Greer (known for his work with Dan the Automator and most recently Foster the People’s platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated album, Torches), The Soft White Sixties show no signs of slowing down.“The Soft White Sixties look like they belong on a bigger stage.” - Michele McManmon, SF Examiner “Maximum R&B is what was used to describe The Who back in their prime, and Bay Area boys The Soft White Sixties are prime candidates to take that description as their own. Having just recently sold out a headlining gig at The Great American Music Hall, the quintet are laying down a sinfully soulful rock sound that always goes down smooth.” - Andrew Pohl, Noise Pop 2011 “Attendees who bump the seminal Nuggets garage rock compilations might suggest that a concoction of fun-loving, acid-tinged soul and bluesy guitar-rock co-indicates, on paper, gleefully chaotic and uneven musicianship. Perish the thought: the Sixties mold their muse into a modern soul-rock machine via a tight performance unencumbered by the large accompanying volumes of booze…Beyond the swamp-rock odes and sunny psychedelic blues, these guys were obviously having fun getting their work done.” - Mike Orne, SF Weekly “SF’s the Soft White Sixties sound like if Elton John wrote songs for CCR (use your imagination, and don’t think of the analogy as degrading), and went all over the place with them, sometimes diving into the heavy guitar of Tony Iommi, other times skipping along with the Strokes’ first album.”- Midtown Monthlyvia Facebook","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">The Soft White Sixties, one of San Francisco’s most talked about bands, have been hailed by some press as legitimate heirs to the Maximum R&B moniker placed on The Who some 40-plus years ago; and while that’s not un-true, The Soft White Sixties offer so much more.

From being raised by the queens of musical theater, to being toughened up by the seasoned cats of R&B and taken under the wing of rock-n-roll; Bell’s large musical family has created an extremely original and compelling monster. With a voice that fits in the realm of her soulful British female counterparts, she backs it up with an energetic rock-n-soul vibe. While giving a nod to the great musical souls of the past, Bell didn’t just close her eyes and throwback a few stones hoping to catch the resurrected wave of the 60’s and 70’s. “I wanted to create a record of songs that captured the energy of what naturally comes out of me, the musicians I work with, and I wanted to stay true to the neighborhood I grew up in.” Montrose neighborhood in Houston, TX- where Bell had her first encounter with singer/songwriter, John Evans, and producer/co-writer of her debut record. “It was a special music scene going on there, Delta blues, southern roots music; musicians inspired by the greats- Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, Gene VIncent, etc.” At 19, Bell was bar tending and singing with bands in the scene. “These were my friends and some of my greatest musical influences. And when I saw John play for the first time, he immediately became a great friend and influence.” In 2006, Emily moved to the west coast, where she wrote, sang and recorded with former members of Tony Toni Tone, and Lucy Pearl. ""My musical world began to open up to whole new planets.” After a few years, Bell felt the longing to bring her newly discovered planets back to where she came from. “Texas is home to me. It’s also where my musical roots are.” states Emily. Back in Texas, a run in with her old friend John Evans changed things. “We immediately began collaborating on songs. I wanted to tie the thread between what I experienced musically on the west coast to my musical roots back home. John was the perfect guy to do that with. He’s been crossing boundaries in southern music for over a decade."" Together their inspirations span from The Ronnettes to Otis Redding, Gene Vincent to Hank Williams, and The Stones to The Stooges. The result is a collection of high energy, highly original songs. Her first release is a Double A Side featuring two songs off the record, “Back to the Way I Was”, a stompy rock and soul number that cleverly captures Bell’s return to the place of her roots and “Pusher Girl” a distorted bluesy track with a vocal delivery from Bell that captures the days of when a woman sang about freedom with belted power and seduction. All in all, it showcases a collection of songs that are built with old school steel, but the tracks they ride on are polished and new. Bell is dropping the Double A side available on 7’ vinyl and ITunes in December.","<p>Somewhere in the world between technicolored soul, southern blues and 60’s rock-n-roll, Austin, TX singer/songwriter, Emily Bell, has a debut disc that sonically fits on it’s own planet.

You can hear the echoes of classic Stax sides in the punchy horns of “Yo Mama” and feel the intense romanticism of vintage Motown singles in the piercing ballad “I’m Your Fool.” Yet, unlike so many musicians drawing inspiration from those fertile sources, Larry isn’t interested in meticulous recreation: “I’m anything but a pure traditionalist or revivalist,” he says. Indeed, in the era of Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr, Larry g(EE) strives for something authentic and original, making a connection to eternal feelings through his music. Call it a proudly analog vision in a fully digital world.The Dallas-based singer-songwriter first made waves and earned critical acclaim as fiery frontman for rock band Odis, but felt the need for a creative rejuvenation, something far funkier and more soulful. In 2010, Larry struck out on his own, writing what would become “Weekends” over a summer in Brooklyn, and returning to Texas to collaborate with producer Beau Bedford (whose credits include work with the Apache 5, Dovetail and Kirby Brown). The four-track “Weekends” was released in Dec. 2011.“Weekends” showcases a strutting blend of funk, silky soul and smart pop melodies that become irresistibly lodged in your brain. Critics have called Larry’s music “finger-licking … enlivened soul music” (Pegasus News) and dared listeners “to find a single thing to hate” (Under the Gun). Larry has showcased his unique, intoxicating sound on stages from Los Angeles to New York City, with stops at South by Southwest, a stint on the Vans Warped Tour and high-profile slots opening for an array of national artists, including Ghostland Observatory and Linda Perry. He recently made his national television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Quite simply, “Weekends” heralds the arrival of a phenomenal talent, gearing up for a dynamic, exciting and artistically satisfying career, one as great and indelible as the artists he admires. The EP “Weekends” will give listeners a jolt – a burst of life-affirming, beautifully rendered music that evokes the past, even as it is firmly rooted in the present.via Facebook","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">Modern, yet timeless.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/west-water-outlaws","West Water Outlaws","Boulder, CO","","The Outlaws were formed in early 2010 when singer Blake Rooker accidentally walked into the wrong statistics class, hazily. He ran into a friend from freshman year at CU, Will S. Buck Esq. who had interest in forming a band. After fifteen minutes of what felt like brothers meeting for the first time, Rooker and Buck discovered each others love for down home blues and dirty rock and roll, and a band practice was scheduled for later that evening. After a few practices and some spirited writing sessions the band started playing parties in the basement of Rooker’s house. Interestingly enough during the mass explosion of dj software and macbook pros, not many parties in Boulder featured live Rock & Roll bands at this point in time. The rock parties were a hit and the band began playing out at bars and local clubs for a small fee of beer and food. After adding Andrew “Monkey” Oakley on drums and Vincent “Funky” Ellwood on bass, The West Water Outlaws have managed to win the 2010 CU battle of the bands, and share the stage with national acts such as Rose Hill Drive, Dirty Sweet, The Swayback and Rival Sons. Using recording time won in the battle of the bands the Outlaws released their first official EP entitled “Crooked Angel”, recorded, mixed and mastered at Coupe Studios. In June of 2011 The Outlaws booked their first regional tour ever and piled into a black F250, later known as “Black Sabbath,” and headed south with only four total shows confirmed. West Water was an instant hit on their first stop in Memphis, Tennessee and was immediately offered another show the following night. By the end of the month, the band had played over twelve shows in four cities, and grown their fan base by 25%. There’s no telling what The Outlaws are cooking up next but it’s a guarantee that their shows will be high energy and rowdy both on and off the stage. This will be a band to watch as they strive to be the next big thing out of Boulder.","<p>The Outlaws were formed in early 2010 when singer Blake Rooker accidentally walked into the wrong statistics class, hazily.

Miranda Dodson is one to remember.Miranda’s innovative folk winds through guitar strings, around vintage horns and forward-thinking synths, through wide-ranging-heart-filled vocals to turn listeners into believers. With lyrical images that reach right into the imagination, Miranda draws the listener into story and into sound. From impassioned alt-country ballads to fun head-bobbing folk-pop each track of her album “Change A Thing” stands strongly on its own but also hangs together united by collaborative creativity.With Producer Robert Harrison (Future Couds & Radar & Cotton Mather) at the helm & Lars Goransson (Alpha Rev, What Made Milwaukee Famous, The Solider Thread) sitting in as mix engineer and co-producer, this record is a true collection of artistry. A blend of folk-pop & alt-country, this record features some of Austin’s best musicians: George Reiff on bass (Jakob Dylan, Court Yard Hounds), Rick Richards on drums (Ray Wylie Hubbard), Joshua Zarbo on bass (Spoon, John Vanderslice), Derek Morris on piano (Alpha Rev)… and more! This strong rhythm section sets the foundations for a record that teams with quality & creativity… a perfect compliment to Dodson’s soaring vocals and down-to-earth lyrics.A native texan, Dodson makes her home in the “Live Music Capital of the World” – Austin, TX. While this is Miranda’s first concerted effort at releasing a full length record, Miranda has previously self-released three other recordings: “Cord of Three Strands”, “Miranda” & “Seriously”. Dodson has also been apart of several compilation albums including “Life Is Precious” (Wes King Tribute) & “Music For The City Vol. 1” – a compilation of Austin’s best artists benefiting Austin’s best local charities. This compilation also features: Alpha Rev, The Soldier Thread, Quiet Company, Brennen Leigh and more. Miranda was also featured is Austin’s First Night Parade, Miranda was invited to be 1 of only 3 music floats ringing in 2010 playing live with her band to over 50,000 Austinites. Dodson was also featured in Music For The City’s Hope For Haiti Benefit Concert that sold out The Parish and raised over $17,000 for Haiti’s orphans.Before moving to Austin Miranda spent much of her college career writing, recording and touring all over Texas and the Southern states, during this time she was invited to tour in Germany in 2002 and won 2nd place in the 2002 Duct Tape Songwriting contest, steadily gaining a solid fan base all along the way. After moving to Austin in 2007 Miranda began writing the material that would be “Change A Thing”. Producer Robert Harrison who is known for his innovative experimental rock was an interesting choice for the folk songstress, “While looking over my collection of songs” says Dodson, “…I knew that I needed a producer who was first and foremost an artist themselves to bring the full production of these songs to fruition…” Harrison’s experimental nature was a perfect match with Dodson’s hypnotic vocals and heartfelt delivery of her truth-filled lyrics.","<p><span style=""color: #4e4c4c; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;"">Pure & intimate…Miranda Dodson’s voice is like an old friend you haven’t seen in a while…familiar…refreshing & when you leave you think…“we should do this more often.” Her songs are simple and pure, Alt Folk with a progressive edge.

While reference points stretch from Big Star, Husker Dü, The Kinks, and Supergrass, to Devo and AC/DC, the catchy and euphoric noise of The Melismatics is theirs alone.

A swaggering, super-tight pop band fronted by Ryan Smith, The Melismatics take their own modern vision and sterling hooks and tumble them around with the best aspects of the classics. While reference points stretch from Big Star, Husker Dü, The Kinks, and Supergrass, to Devo and AC/DC, the catchy and euphoric noise of The Melismatics is theirs alone.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/hidden-pictures","Hidden Pictures","kansas city/lawrence","","Released July 2012 on newly minted Kansas City label Golden Sound Records, Hidden Pictures’ third LP Rainbow Records is a festival of open-window jams and summery anthems that finds the band hitting a high-spirited, fresh, and powerpop-inflected stride. Rainbow Records benefits from the added rhythmic firepower of drummer Cameron Hawk (better known as the reckless frontman of The Dead Girls) and bassist Erik Voeks (also a first-order songwriter in his own right). The whole mess was mixed to a sonically perfect wonderstew by Ed Rose, man-at-knobs for celebrated popsters like the Get Up Kids and Ultimate Fakebook. While all of Richard’s shrugging romanticism is still intact, Rainbow Records touches on a new theme: the bittersweet decline of the music industry. “Calling Christine” salutes an aging partygirl who gets drunk and dances to ‘80s music to the chagrin of lookers-on. “Solo Record Shop” is an elegy to once-great songwriters who have lost their touch. “Oldies 104.3” lambastes the oldies format for becoming watered down with bloated ‘70s megahits. “Rainbow Records” contemplates the death of the CD while paying homage to the suburban Chicago record store Richard frequented as a teenager. Most importantly, Rainbow Records is a heartening, sophisticated, and riotously fun record from a band that has consistently demonstrated a knack for perfect pop portraiture. Hidden Pictures began in 2008, when Michelle Gaume Sanders crashed the all-boys party that was the final lineup of Richard’s longstanding band OK Jones. Stepping up as backup singer and glockenspiel plinker, Michelle brought new harmony to Richard’s table, which previously had been wrought with driving, Americana-tinged indie pop. As Hidden Pictures, the duo released a self-titled debut of clever acoustic ballads about the joys and foibles of romance that laid the thematic foundation for the more adventurous work to come. Seeking to flesh out their sound, Richard and Michelle assembled a backing band of musicians and studio wonks representing the best of their native Kansas City scene. The newly expanded Pics produced two crisp EPs (Choosing Sides, Whitney Houston) before turning out the acclaimed 2011 full-length Synchronized Sleeping. A fully-realized gem of reverb-laden hooks, tight harmonies, and Richard’s wry and sweet commentary on the push and pull of relationships, Synchronized Sleeping featured numbers like the pro-argument anthem “Choosing Sides,” the infectious library love story “Anne Apparently,” and the winking slowdance “For the Sake of the Streak.” Hidden Pictures has twice being nominated for Best Pop Band by Kansas City altweekly The Pitch. Sanders played her last show with the band in October 2012, opening the door for new collaborations on the Pics’ forthcoming 2013 LP. - Jason Harper","<p>Released July 2012 on newly minted Kansas City label Golden Sound Records, Hidden Pictures’ third LP Rainbow Records is a festival of open-window jams and summery anthems that finds the band hitting a high-spirited, fresh, and powerpop-inflected stride.</p> <p>Rainbow Records benefits from the added rhythmic firepower of drummer Cameron Hawk (better known as the reckless frontman of The Dead Girls) and bassist Erik Voeks (also a first-order songwriter in his own right).

Based around the idea of psychological dysphoria, Powers tried to document the trails of his mind through songs of minimalism and hypnotic ambience. Powers later described his writing process as “my mind communicating with me, not the other way around…it can take me to scary places but I’ve realized those bizarre thoughts I have don’t define me.” After signing with Mississippi-based label Fat Possum Records in 2011, he toured much of the following year before going back into solitude to write. Wondrous Bughouse, Powers’ sophomore album (due March 5 worldwide via Fat Possum), was spawned from what he describes as “becoming more fascinated with the human psyche and where the spiritual meets the physical world.” During the time he wrote, Powers became intrigued with the metaphysical universe and blending those ideas with pop music. “Youth Lagoon is something so personal to me because writing music is how I sort mythoughts, as well as where I transfer my fears,” explains Powers. “My mental state is usually pretty sporadic… a lot of this record was influenced by a fear of mortality but embracing it at the same time. Realizing that human life is only great because it is temporary. Experimenting with ideas about dimensions. I’m not a gifted speaker, soexplaining things is difficult for me.

Palm trees swaying gently in the balmy breeze? Scantily-clad bikini buxom babes rollerblading down an infinite slab of coral-colored concrete? How about anthemic, bombastic, life-affirming indie pop? If the latter didn’t occur to you, let us introduce you to Surfer Blood: they call West Palm Beach home and, while still in their early 20s, have penned “Astro Coast”, an album’s worth of catchy, summery indie songs that even the most hook-laden power pop band would rightfully be jealous of. Members JP (dubbed “The Mastermind” by the rest of the band), TJ and Thomas met one fateful night at an after party for Miami’s Ultra Festival, though they didn’t attend the festival itself (“We do not like the D’n’B,” they proclaim). After discussing music – what else? –for the remainder of the night, JP decided to recruit the other guys to perfect some songs he had been working on, and thus, the band was formed. Tyler and I had been playing with a few different people and nothing seemed to be working out. When Tom approached me at that party, he seemed dead serious about touring and trying to make the band work. I had seen how his previous bands had been; his old band had done a tour up to Atlanta over spring break when they were fifteen. It was exactly what Tyler and I needed. I gave him my phone number that night and he called me the next afternoon. He came by our rehearsal space and I showed him the recordings that would become “Astro Coast”. The fact that the other guys believed in the music from the very beginning was a huge catalyst”. From then on, things moved at a breakneck pace. A mere two months after they met they started touring outside of Florida in July, up to New York in August and then to Chicago in September. On a recommendation from a friend, they started recording “Astro Coast” at a studio in Port St. Lucie Florida, but when they only finished the drums at the end of a two day session, Tyler and JP decided to take matters into their own hands, spending the next six months tracking and mixing the record in JP’s apartment in Boca Raton with a copy of Pro Tools which Tyler procured for “dirt cheap” through a community college where he was studying in Orlando. JP asserts, “It gave us the opportunity to give our album the time and thought it deserved”. Their live shows started coming into their own as well, with the band practicing every day and touring nonstop, their newfound energy resulting in a constant evolution and refinement of their sound. “Our live set is always changing”, JP says. “Subtle things begin to work their way into the songs and before you know it people are coming up to you after shows and telling you that the live show is a completely different experience from the record”. The tipping point for the band, of course, was last year’s CMJ Music Marathon, where they played a whopping 13 shows in 7 days, catching the eye of the likes of Interview and The New York Times in the process. With the resultant excited chatter anointing them as the band to watch bar none, and a record deal freshly inked with Kanine Records, Surfer Blood released “Astro Coast”. In the following months “Astro Coast” attracted accolades across the board. The album and its songs landed atop numerous Best of Lists, including Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and Filter, with Bob Boilen from NPR declaring “…dig into Astro Coast and you’ll hear why, song for song, this may be my favorite album of 2010.”","<p>When you think of Palm Beach, Florida, what comes to mind?

It was nearly impossible to tour if you didn’t have access to some kind of personnel carrier, and making a record involved several years of tambourine overdubs. You know there were kids out there who just wanted to get in a van and play loud as hell through an Ampeg stack or a four-piece drum kit, but how could you call it a band if you didn’t even know a French horn player? By 2008, band membership had reached a critical mass. You’d go to a show and you might be the only person in the room who wasn’t playing an instrument. Hard times. Thankfully, there are always a few naturally resourceful people who refuse to be intimidated or excluded from making their own wild racket in public. Alex Edkins, Hayden Menzies and Chris Slorach have been around long enough to know that if you can’t fit it in the van, it’s not worth bringing. METZ play like one brutally heavy instrument with three heads, slashing heavy-gauge strings, bending guitar and bass necks in weird unison, along with what is probably the loudest drumming you’ve ever heard. It’s a return to everything that’s good about loud, ecstatic live music; a frantic nod to Nation of Ulysses, Shellac, The Pixies, The Jesus Lizard, and Public Image Ltd. at their most vicious, while still carving out some heavy new business. They play the instruments, the amps, and the room. Over the last three-and-a-half years, METZ have slayed in basements, skate shops, clubs, and festivals, sharing stages with Mission of Burma, Death from Above 1979, Archers of Loaf, Mudhoney, Oneida, Constantines, and NoMeansNo. I’ve seen a hundred jaws drop within the first four measures of their set. I once saw Alexander Hacke from Einstuerzende Neubauten approach Chris and rave about his bass tone. It’s a formidable task to try and capture such a powerful live band on record. Luckily, Graham Walsh (Holy Fuck) and Alexandre Bonenfant were more than up for it. Isolating the band in an old barn for a week with a portable recording rig, Walsh and Bonenfant were not only successful in documenting the unrelenting live force of the band, but they also managed to add some new and staggering sonic textures to the recording. Waves of organic feedback and fuzzed-out drones build the classic tension that eventually drops into each track’s relentless, dissonant pulse. And somehow, the raddest thing about it all is the songwriting. It’s not just riffs. It’s something that some heavy bands don’t get, but METZ do really well—and they do it collectively. It’s a hell of an experience, listening to this thing. With this, their debut album, METZ articulate with deafening clarity, what we’ve all known for some time: The world of good music needs a new power trio, and this is it.","<p>There was a time, in recent history, when you needed to have at least twelve members to even be considered a band in Canada.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/phosphorescent","Phosphorescent","Brooklyn, NY","","Nearly three years on from his breakthrough album Here’s To Taking It Easy, Phosphorescent returns to the fray with his most stunning record yet: Muchacho. During the last album’s ‘cycle’, one could almost hear jaws hitting the floor witnessing a live band of such infinite verve. Not only did the album draw high praise in the form of Mojo’s ‘Album of the Month’ (#8 End of Year), Sunday Times & The Independent ‘Albums of the Week’, hit Rough Trade’s Top 5 Best of the Year, but the band also supported The National over the course of three sold out nights at Brixton Academy, a show that The Independent gave 5/5 and called “a sublime, joyous gig”. Matthew Houck, for he is Phosphorescent, likes to work. The Alabama native, now resident in Brooklyn has delivered five albums as Phosphorescent since his 2003 debut. Houck has a highly distinctive artistic voice, but also a refreshing, rolled-sleeves approach to his expression, and if he had his way, he’d have twice as many albums under his belt by now. The singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer is envious of the time when prolificacy was expected. “In the ’60s and ’70s, they were making artists crank out records every six months. With guys like Waylon Jennings, John Prine and even Dylan, I don’t think those records would have gotten made in today’s climate, because now you’re allowed – or even required – to make a grand statement. I have this ideal – and I know it’s not possible, because of the way the industry works – of making a record every year.” Houck may not have managed that, but still has an impressive output – one born of commitment and his soul’s need to have its say. It was 2007’s Pride – a delicate and spare, haunted and haunting work of ragged country, bittersweet southern gospel and forlorn folk-ish drone – that first caused ears to swivel appreciatively in Phosphorescent’s direction. He followed it with To Willie, a tribute to country legend Willie Nelson, then 2010’s Here’s To Taking It Easy, an unapologetically enthusiastic plunge into country rock and rolling Americana. Now, his sixth album flashes yet another colour in the subtly shifting Phosphorescent spectrum. Muchacho reprises the understated melancholia and sensuous minimalism of Pride, while kicking up a little of Here’s To Taking It Easy’s dust, but it also strikes out into more adventurous waters via rhythm and electronic textures. It took shape if not quite by accident, then partly as a result of events beyond Houck’s control. After spending the best part of 18 months touring his last record, Houck was, in his words “pretty fried.” In late 2011, he returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard studio where he’d recorded his previous two albums, planning “on taking this whole thing down a few notches. I wanted to make music,” he explains, “but I was weary, so the spectre of putting anything out and getting back on the road was a bit of a block.” In December, he bought a load of old analogue gear and “just starting playing around with it, making these noises. They weren’t songs, they were just strange sound pieces. I’ve always had that element in my work, and one or two weird, ambient pieces seem to squeeze themselves onto every record, but suddenly I was doing a lot of those.” Houck also turned into a bit of DIY electrician, since a lot of the vintage gear needed fixing. “I ended up spending a lot of time learning about stuff like impedance matching and ohms,” he laughs. “I really got quite nerdy about how it all worked.” Houck also got very enthusiastic about the sonics that would eventually feed into the strikingly raw, Can-like, ‘Ride On/Right On’, where his simple, whooping vocal and 808 drum beats are the focus, the production is echo-heavy and the guitar little more than abstract background choogling. “I’ve always been happy with the records I’ve made,” the singer says, “but sonically, I think there’s been something lacking. This time, I was getting really excited about the experimental sounds I was making. I was thinking I might make an ambient record that had vocals, but no lyrics. I was actually considering releasing it under another name, or even my own name.” So, a much-needed break, plus some enjoyable messing around with noise, without much thought as to how to use it. But, exactly as 2012 turned, Houck’s life began to unravel. A domestic crisis meant he had to find another apartment/studio at short notice, in the dead of winter. In accommodation-squeezed New York. His life was falling apart, but almost perversely, “songs just started happening, and there were five or six of them.” Houck admits he was “in the middle of a bit of a freak-out,” so in the small hours one Sunday, he booked a ticket to Mexico, on a plane that was leaving three hours later. “It sounds really cheesy, but I went down there with a guitar and got a little hut on the beach in Tulum, on the Yucatan Peninsula.” He spent a week there, working to finish the songs that would become Muchacho, then went back to NYC, found a new place, fitted it out with his studio and began tracking the record in May 2012. ‘Muchacho’s Tune’ – with its opening braid of twanging guitars, piano and electric keys, its warm, rich reverb and poignant mariachi brass – is the song on which the album turns. “I’ve been fucked-up and I’ve been a fool,” confesses Houck, who may or may not be the feckless man-boy of the title. This was the first song to come to him fully formed, and it establishes the album’s lyrical theme – “that the possibility of redemption through love and romance is not just hopeful, it’s also viable. It definitely exists. But what ends up happening is more redemption through some vague means that I don’t really understand.” The album is perfectly framed by ‘Sun, Arise! (An Invocation, An Introduction)’ and ‘Sun’s Arising (A Koan, An Exit)’, the opening and closing tracks respectively. Sweet, healing and hugely potent in their hymnal simplicity, they not only recognise the diurnal rhythm that governs our existence, but also remind us that however dark things might get, the light will always reappear. ‘Muchacho’s Tune’, the somber and majestically slow ‘A New Anhedonia’ and the seductively loose ‘The Quotidian Beasts’ are the album’s fullest songs in terms of instrumentation and arrangements. Houck called on around 20 musicians at different times to add various parts, including members of the superior five-piece live band that has recently made such an eloquent and physically powerful contribution to Phosphorescent’s soulful expression. But the album’s composition and production are again all his own. “It’s really always me by myself, so much so that with Pride, no one else played anything. I have a group of really great dudes, and I’ll happily trumpet how fantastic these guys are, but a band going into the studio, as one? That never happens.” ‘A New Anhedonia’ – a gorgeous, charcoal grey song on which understated piano, soft brush work and ripples of pedal-steel guitar are matched with heavy reverb and gently sighing backing vocals – was the second song to come fully formed to Houck. And the crisis it describes was resolved by the very writing. Anhedonia is a loss of the ability to take pleasure in something the sufferer usually finds enjoyable, and Houck experienced it in those winter months following that grueling tour. It’s quite a shock to hear him murmur, “all the music is boring to me” and then describe music as “foreign”, but that’s how he felt for a short, dark while. “In addition to what was going on in my personal life, music had always been the most reliable thing for me, but I had a few really lost months of not caring about it, of not deriving any pleasure from music. I felt detached and adrift from everything. Oddly enough, I don’t think I knew the word ‘anhedonia’; it just kind of popped up right around the time of writing that song. That dread was still quite prevalent, even after the batch of songs came together.” If losing one’s way results in something as lustrous as the first album taster ‘Song for Zula’, more artists should find life’s maze and walk around for an indefinite period. It is such a glorious gem that unfolds with Houck’s cracked vocal stalking the perimeters unabashed. And this amidst an album positively riddled with highlights like ‘Terror in the Canyons’ and superlative ‘A Charm/A Blade’; all barreling piano and stabby horns galore. It’s indicative of Houck’s distinctive talent, dedication to his work and trust in his muse, then, that a temporary hurdle didn’t become a serious block. “I got clear of it by just getting to work on the recording,” he says, simply. Sleeves rolled. Resolve fixed. Muchacho delivered.","<p>Nearly three years on from his breakthrough album Here’s To Taking It Easy, Phosphorescent returns to the fray with his most stunning record yet: Muchacho. During the last album’s ‘cycle’, one could almost hear jaws hitting the floor witnessing a live band of such infinite verve. Not only did the album draw high praise in the form of Mojo’s ‘Album of the Month’ (#8 End of Year), Sunday Times & The Independent ‘Albums of the Week’, hit Rough Trade’s Top 5 Best of the Year, but the band also supported The National over the course of three sold out nights at Brixton Academy, a show that The Independent gave 5/5 and called “a sublime, joyous gig”.</p> <p>Matthew Houck, for he is Phosphorescent, likes to work. The Alabama native, now resident in Brooklyn has delivered five albums as Phosphorescent since his 2003 debut. Houck has a highly distinctive artistic voice, but also a refreshing, rolled-sleeves approach to his expression, and if he had his way, he’d have twice as many albums under his belt by now. The singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer is envious of the time when prolificacy was expected. “In the ’60s and ’70s, they were making artists crank out records every six months. With guys like Waylon Jennings, John Prine and even Dylan, I don’t think those records would have gotten made in today’s climate, because now you’re allowed – or even required – to make a grand statement. I have this ideal – and I know it’s not possible, because of the way the industry works – of making a record every year.”</p> <p>Houck may not have managed that, but still has an impressive output – one born of commitment and his soul’s need to have its say. It was 2007’s Pride – a delicate and spare, haunted and haunting work of ragged country, bittersweet southern gospel and forlorn folk-ish drone – that first caused ears to swivel appreciatively in Phosphorescent’s direction. He followed it with To Willie, a tribute to country legend Willie Nelson, then 2010’s Here’s To Taking It Easy, an unapologetically enthusiastic plunge into country rock and rolling Americana. Now, his sixth album flashes yet another colour in the subtly shifting Phosphorescent spectrum.</p> <p>Muchacho reprises the understated melancholia and sensuous minimalism of Pride, while kicking up a little of Here’s To Taking It Easy’s dust, but it also strikes out into more adventurous waters via rhythm and electronic textures. It took shape if not quite by accident, then partly as a result of events beyond Houck’s control. After spending the best part of 18 months touring his last record, Houck was, in his words “pretty fried.” In late 2011, he returned to the Brooklyn Navy Yard studio where he’d recorded his previous two albums, planning “on taking this whole thing down a few notches. I wanted to make music,” he explains, “but I was weary, so the spectre of putting anything out and getting back on the road was a bit of a block.” In December, he bought a load of old analogue gear and “just starting playing around with it, making these noises. They weren’t songs, they were just strange sound pieces. I’ve always had that element in my work, and one or two weird, ambient pieces seem to squeeze themselves onto every record, but suddenly I was doing a lot of those.” Houck also turned into a bit of <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">DIY</span></span> electrician, since a lot of the vintage gear needed fixing. “I ended up spending a lot of time learning about stuff like impedance matching and ohms,” he laughs. “I really got quite nerdy about how it all worked.”</p> <p>Houck also got very enthusiastic about the sonics that would eventually feed into the strikingly raw, Can-like, ‘Ride On/Right On’, where his simple, whooping vocal and 808 drum beats are the focus, the production is echo-heavy and the guitar little more than abstract background choogling. “I’ve always been happy with the records I’ve made,” the singer says, “but sonically, I think there’s been something lacking. This time, I was getting really excited about the experimental sounds I was making. I was thinking I might make an ambient record that had vocals, but no lyrics. I was actually considering releasing it under another name, or even my own name.” So, a much-needed break, plus some enjoyable messing around with noise, without much thought as to how to use it. But, exactly as 2012 turned, Houck’s life began to unravel. A domestic crisis meant he had to find another apartment/studio at short notice, in the dead of winter. In accommodation-squeezed New York.

Nicki has filled a void in music with her brand of vintage-tinged rocking country soul — music that’s like an enchanting friend you’ve known for a short while but feels like you’ve known forever. In 2011 alone, Nicki has moved with grace and style from the studio to the main stages of the nation’s most revered music festivals (Outside Lands, High Sierra, Strawberry, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass), where her strong voice, striking presence and penchant for songcraft have made an undeniable impression and received rousing reception from audiences of all ages. Nicki’s story began at a New Year’s Eve party where she sang an Allman Brothers song, catching the attention of musician/producer Tim Bluhm (Mother Hips). With Tim’s encouragement, Nicki began to write her own songs and perform in public. The two fell in love and married, followed by the recording of Nicki’s debut album, Toby’s Song (2008), which was heralded as one of Jambase’s top ten albums of the year. Nicki’s music took on a life of its own with the formation of a band with childhood friend and lead guitarist Deren Ney. Nicki Bluhm & The Gramblers grew with the addition of drummer Mike Curry (Jackpot), bassist/vocalist Steve Adams (ALO), and rhythm guitarist/vocalist Dave Mulligan. The band headed into the studio and emerged with Nicki’s sophomore album, Driftwood (2011), a collection of songs that evoke the AM magic of Linda Ronstadt, the honest charm of Johnny and June Cash’s duets, and the stoney sounds of retro Memphis soul. “Part Karen Carpenter and part Grace Slick, Bluhm’s voice moves effortlessly between softer, country tinged balladry and retro ‘60s/’70s rock,” No Depression declared.Since Driftwood’s release, Nicki has performed with her band, as a duo with her husband, as a vocalist for West Coast supergroup Brokedown in Bakersfield, and as the special guest of countless musical legends. She has been called on to share the stage with Chris Robinson, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Steve Kimock, Jackie Greene, Pegi Young and Josh Ritter; and has performed on “The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.” Nicki is currently touring and has a new album with Tim called Duets.There’s no question that Nicki Bluhm is the “It Girl” of San Francisco’s storied music scene. Luckily for us, the future is looking even brighter for rock’s rising star.","<div>Upon hearing the unique and refreshing sound of Nicki Bluhm, it becomes </div><div>immediately clear why she is in the midst of a breakout year.

They decide to do it themselves- They form a band, they name themselves The Midgetmen, they book a show, they acquire some drink tickets, they release an album, they get some more drink tickets, they release a second album, they give away free fried chicken, they accumulate more drink tickets, they get better at writing songs, they book a tour of the midwest, they keep on writing songs, they almost win some Austin Music Awards, they find some drink tickets laying on the dirty floor of any number of bars, they release a third album, they play in the Northeast, they write more songs and keep getting free beer. They accidentally establish a Midgetmen ethos: do the absurd, but do it right, do it yourselves, and do it fun. If The Midgetmen operated their band like they do their day jobs, they might have given up long ago and just bought a few hundred six packs of Pabst Blue Ribbon at a convenience store. After all, those guitars and amps and pressing albums cost a lot more than all of those free beers together. Financially and emotionally, being in a band is not a great investment. But, if The Midgetmen had done that, would they have gotten to play with The Wrens, Titus Andronicus, Free Energy, Ezra Furman & The Harpoons, Franz Nicolay, Grant Hart and hundreds of other great bands? Would they have made countless friends and remained sane at their day job desks? Would they ever have gone to Abilene, Omaha, La Crosse, Morgantown, or College Station? Doubtful at best. The Midgetmen are an ever devolving work in progress, if progress is measured in inches and how far four friends can take an unhealthy hobby. Called Austin’s slop-punk mavens by a local writer, The Midgetmen just keep getting louder, fuzzier, and more fun… which is all the band has wanted to do since forming in 2002. Well, that and get free beer.","<p>What happens when four friends working together in the software industry realize that some bands with marginal talent are getting free beers on a Tuesday night?

The trio began playing around their hometown of Detroit shortly thereafter, around which time Trombley headed to California for what would come to be a three-year respite from the band and also the impetus for a revolving door of drummers, bassist and keyboard players. Undaunted, The Sights took to the studio and began recording their debut album, Are You Green?, at Jim Diamond’s Ghetto Recorders in Detroit. Originally released in June of 1999, Are You Green? was picked up by L.A.-based Fall of Rome Records and re-released the following year. Never big on rest, The Sights went to work on their sophomore album, Got What We Want (released in 2002). With this, the band’s freakishly precocious ability to blend frenetic garage rock, Motown and 60’s pop into something equal parts classic and catchy got them noticed. Got What We Want was released in the U.K. a year later, garnering them some very nice words from both the British press (""Got What We Want is a revelation – a treasure trove of sparky and wildly immediate songwriting."" -NME) and the not-so British press (""At last – a new Detroit-garage band that comes in colors."" —Rolling Stone). The Sights hit the road for a year of touring both countries, including a 10-week stint sleeping inside the group’s 1991 Ford Econoline van and stealing bagels for sustenance. In the spring of 2004, The Sights – now including Bobby Emmett as organist/bassist and Keith Fox as drummer – caught the ear of exSmashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, who signed them to his own Scratchie Records (an imprint of New Line Records). And with that, the band headed back to Ghetto Recorders to record their self-titled third LP, The Sights, due out in March 2005. No small feat, the album combines the unobtrusive honesty of The Band with slivers of influence from The Sights’ own personal record collections: Ike & Tina, Solomon Burke, Everly Brothers, Bob Seger, Tim Hardin and all manner of raucous songwriting. The end result is an album that’s classic, not derivative—filled with swagger and deference—and ridiculously catchy.

And for that reason, their self-titled record (in two parts) plays much like a travelogue, a recollection of distant places that tend to mimic their own, somehow foreign, neighborhoods. Musically, The Eastern Sea combines swelling post-rock-like percussion, energetic and melodic bass guitar, lofty wurlizter, synthesizer pads, and finger-picked guitar that can either float above the ground or come down like a ton of bricks. As a band, The Eastern Sea tends to mimic their own musical aesthetic, sometimes swelling to a massive 11-piece collective featuring string and brass instruments, and sometimes simplifying down to the core players in the group: Tomas Garcia-Olano (Bass/Keys), Zach Duran (Percussion), Kevin Thomas (Trumpet/Percussion), and Matthew Hines (Guitar/Vocals/Keys) are the solid foundation on which the band is built. The sound and unique sense of place heard on The Eastern Sea’s two-part self-titled release also has much to do with the band’s unique recording and music writing process. Having just graduated from St. Edward’s University in Austin, Texas as valedictorian of his senior class, singer/guitarist/songwriter Matthew Hines has had to work, along with the other full-time students in the band, to create something special despite an often insane schedule. As the band continues to grow on a regional and national level, what 90.5 KUT, Austin’s nationally-renowned public radio, has said of the band certainly rings true. “Austin and the rest of the indie-pop world will be hearing a lot from this act for awhile.” Listen at Last.fm Watch videos of The Eastern Sea playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!","<div>At times, it is easy for The Eastern Sea to forget that Austin, Texas is home.

Along the way he jammed with Nashville backups, toured the hallowed grounds of Memphis, and (to hear him tell it) broke a heart or two in New Orleans. But it was a cock-eyed stroll down Sixth St. in Austin that had the biggest impact on the wandering songwriter. Through the din of reveling tourists and bar hopping college kids, T-Bird heard the unmistakable strains of some real blues.

The mystery is revealed: ‘A New Kind Of Something’ is the first single from the ‘Common Mama’ project by Ferdinando Arnò and the singer for this track is Jon Kenzie. Jon Kenzie is a young British artist with an extraordinary voice – both fresh and evocative, original and yet familiar – which seems to emerge from memory and give it a new direction. Jon began his career playing around London and is now the lead of the group Beggar Joe on the Manchester indie scene. ‘A New Kind Of Something’ was inspired by the final scene of the 1971 cult film ‘Harold and Maude’ by Hal Ashby, where the young lead wanders into the vista of a British mountain landscape playing a banjo, towards the encounter with something new and undefined. In the film, the piece accompanying this scene is by Cat Stevens. Mixing that atmosphere, the banjo sound and a piano solo inspired by The Mamas & The Papas, Arnò composed the song with the voice of Jon Kenzie in mind, a voice with the best colours of 70’s Britpop blues, a hippy crooner with contemporary spirit and gusto… it’s enough to listen to artists like Cloud Control, Feist, and Ray Lamontagne. Recorded between Manchester, Milan and London, the song was mixed at Metropolis Studios in the U.K.’s capital by Tom Elmhirst (Amy Winehouse, Adele, Cee Lo Green…).","<p>Many people around the world, listening to ‘A New Kind Of Something’ in the TV advertising campaign for the worldwide launch of a new tablet PC, have asked themselves (and asked also via the Internet) who wrote it and who sings it, because the song’s lyrics, and the way they are sung, are somehow both immediate and comforting.</p> <p>The mystery is revealed: ‘A New Kind Of Something’ is the first single from the ‘Common Mama’ project by Ferdinando Arnò and the singer for this track is Jon Kenzie.</p> <p>Jon Kenzie is a young British artist with an extraordinary voice – both fresh and evocative, original and yet familiar – which seems to emerge from memory and give it a new direction. <br /> Jon began his career playing around London and is now the lead of the group Beggar Joe on the Manchester indie scene.</p> <p>‘A New Kind Of Something’ was inspired by the final scene of the 1971 cult film ‘Harold and Maude’ by Hal Ashby, where the young lead wanders into the vista of a British mountain landscape playing a banjo, towards the encounter with something new and undefined.

Her voice and talent have been heard across the states and overseas in festivals such as CMJ2011 and opening for acts such as VV Brown. Her innovation as a singer-songwriter echoes rich vocals with a haunting infusion of Folk and R&B. Committed and driven, Christina draws her inspiration through one simple and profound act- creating excellent music. As a result of her passion and experience, Christina has expanded her expertise by creating “L Rock the Party Booking.” L Rock the Party Booking is an NYC based company dedicated to live performance and recorded music through musicians committed to creating art in their music. Whether on stage singing, or as a business woman, Christina continues to be an element of opportunity and possibility in today’s Music Industry.Christina LaRocca grew up under her mother’s musical influence, hoping to one day to sing as beautifully as her. With the record player constantly spinning Stevie Wonder, Natalie Cole, and Aretha Franklin and it’s easy to see where Christina got her soulful and smooth sound. After moving from Brooklyn to Staten Island, during her teen years Christina found herself listening to listening to female radio stars like No Doubt, TLC, Fiona Apple, Alanis Morsette, and Lauryn Hill. She started auditioning for plays and realizing theatre wasn’t satisfying her musical impulse, she picked up a guitar and following her father’s beatnik poetic ways, dug into the deep dark mass throbbing inside her heart and began writing her own music. By 2005 Christina had caught the ears of local musicians such as Carl Gallagher and Dorian Lake. After jamming at a hurricane Katrina fund-raiser, they decided to name their newly found project Heavy Weather. Christina LaRocca & Heavy Weather released “Miles of Mud” in 2008, which has been receiving attention internationally since. Christina was a part of 101.9 RXP’s Record Store Day in April 2010 and was placed on Rich Russo’s Anything Anything Vinyl Compilation Record and came into #69 on records sold in NY. They won the IAR Next Level Competition in 2008 where they got the attention of Grammy Award winning engineer, Dan Grigsby and recorded their second release, the “Fire” EP which was released in 2010. Christina is currently working on a solo project with J Glaze Productions which shall be released world wide through her label, LRock Entertainment, and The Orchard in 2011. Christina LaRocca & Heavy Weather performed at CMJ2010 & 2011, Philadelphia Film & Music Festival 2010, Wave Gathering Festival ’08, NYC Songwriter’s Circle, headlined “From the Penthouse” Artist Series at Tainted Blue Studios, New York City Finalist at “Emergenza,” the international battle of the bands competition, and performed at the Millennium Music Conference (10, 11, and 12) among many other festivals and conferences.

In the center of this revolving cast of musicians, songwriter Joe Fletcher remains at the helm of this country blues-based outfit while still playing many solo acoustic shows throughout the land every year.Sometime in 2007, the band recorded their debut album BURY YOUR PROBLEMS at the rather mysterious Golden Monkey Studio in the heart of Providence’s Smith Hill neighborhood. Details of this event remain murky though it has been corroborated that sound experts Jay Berndt and Matt Oliva oversaw a assortment of musicians which included legends Jack Hanlon, Greg “J.D.” Burgess, Dennis Kelly, and Dale Cunningham. We do know that the record received overwhelmingly positive reviews and Fletcher’s story-driven songwriting began catching national attention earning comparisons to Cash, Cave, Cohen, and Dylan.After a series of lengthy U.S. tours in support of Bury Your Problems, Joe Fletcher & the Wrong Reasons released their sophomore effort WHITE LIGHTER in December 2010. This time they entered the illustrious Machines With Magnets Recording Studio in Pawtucket, R.I. with a cast that included local luminaries Scott Boutier, Jack Hanlon, John McCauley, Alec Redfearn, Damien Puerini, Dave Lamb, MorganEve Swain, Lily Costner, and Tyler Hayden.Following the recording of White Lighter, rhythm kings Dave Hemingway (drums) and Joe Principe (upright and electric bass) joined the organization, and guitar hero Damien Puerini stayed on in the lead role.White Lighter has attracted a whole new level of attention to the band. Most notably, No Depression has championed the band, saying that “Joe Fletcher proves his versatility on White Lighter. His signature brand of dark and lyrically driven honky tonk is interspersed with a softer side that would make Hagg or Jones proud.”Known best for their thrilling live show, Joe Fletcher & the Wrong Reasons have shared stages with many of their favorite acts including Deer Tick, The Low Anthem, Shooter Jennings, John Doe, Robert Earl Keen, The Supersuckers, Lydia Loveless, Murder by Death, Scott H. Biram, Holly Golightly, Slim Cessna’s Auto Club, Brown Bird, and The Devil Makes Three.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/flashbulb-fires","Flashbulb Fires","Denver","","Known for their distinctive brand of emotionally rich American indie-rock, Flashbulb Fires has a genuine conviction to push the boundaries of popular music. The Denver quartet’s knack for combining dynamic song structures with beautifully magnetic arrangements is instantly recognizable, while their live show is immediately captivating, blending polished artistry and raw electricity. With an energy akin to the Arcade Fire and lyrical sketches reminiscent of Pedro the Lion and The National, Flashbulb Fires’ music is both evocative and meticulously crafted. GLORY: In the age of the thin and disjointed digital single, Flashbulb Fires’ debut LP, Glory, is a cohesive artistic statement and an undeniable return to the album as an art form. In the winter of 2008, Flashbulb Fires took up residence in a modest house-turned-studio and began feverishly writing material, recording, and scoring parts for the album’s bold instrumentation. Interrupted only by a national tour, the enigmatic band emerged a year later with a record that was, without a doubt, a complete album in every sense of the word. Unquestionably stirring and impassioned, Glory abounds with lush orchestrations and powerful performances. From breathtaking horn arrangements to intimate acoustic guitars and inspired vocal harmonies, the album inhabits a deliberately divided and overwrought mood from start to finish. The brooding lyrical narratives, facilitated in large part by singer Patrick McGuire’s conflicted religious past and suburban-American upbringing, only further the album’s overall mood. After a childhood spent navigating through an unfulfilling revolving door of religions, McGuire eventually broke from his splintered youth and began to examine his spiritual struggle and suburban fatigue. Using images wrested from the sentiments of a bleeding generation, Glory relentlessly aches and trembles but is ultimately rooted in hope. It is in this hope that the album’s narrators are redeemed, at once detached and triumphant, while observing a society coated by a gauzy ignorance. Glory stands as a modern American album from a modern American band – complex and self-assured. Its haunting themes and dramatic sonic framework strike a compelling balance between the immediately accessible and the subtly profound.

It’s a full, layered sound that achieves no small feat: crowds both want to shout along and listen close—which is why they keep coming back for more. You couldn’t ask for more from a front woman—O’Brien has remarkable emotional and musical range, powerhouse vocals, and undeniable magnetism. Her voice easily brings crowds to their feet, but also has a singular lilt that gives the music a depth beyond its dance-ability. Scene Magazine describes O’Brien’s style as “sweet but not sugary… there’s a piquant, bluesy undertone in her voice….” Songs range from rowdy to slow burn, blending the attitude of O’Brien’s native Chicago with compelling emotional authenticity. This outfit has attitude in spades—and the chops to back it up. Articulate City describes them as “super fun and funky… featuring some of the finest talent in town.” Indeed, this is a super group formed by members of some of the most accomplished and well known bands in the area’s recent history—including The Atoll, Motorhome, and—yes—the Colorado State University Marching Band. Marching Band Director Dr. Christopher Nicholas, on trombone, and Dave Clapsaddle, on sax, inject songs with big-band energy and enthusiasm. With roots in the CSU music program himself, Matthew Mahern ups the rock quotient, adding a bold melodic layer on lead guitar. On bass, Craig Fowler anchors the LOB sound with deeply soulful, danceable grooves. Seasoned drummer Peter Knudson empowers the group’s compositions with driving rhythms tempered by a sophistication that draws from the jazz, blues, world groove, and other influences of his numerous musical projects. LOB has played some of the most acclaimed venues in Northern Colorado and has opened for internationally renowned bands The Fray and Heartless Bastards. A staple of the regional festival scene, they ignited FoCoMX 2011, bringing the entire standing-room-only crowd to its feet with their finale cover of Gloria. Also in 2011, they were featured on the main stage at Fort Collins’ Bohemian Nights at New West Fest, and were selected by Spokesbuzz to represent the best of the Fort Collins music scene on a compilation CD. In 2008, LOB released As Long As it Matters—a showcase of their outstanding range and musicianship. They’ve performed at Congress Theatre in Chicago; Soiled Dove Underground and Walnut Room in Denver; and The Budweiser Events Center, Mishawaka, and Aggie Theater in Northern Colorado, in addition to many more stage and radio performances.","<p>With an edge of daring and a tinge of heartbreak, Lindsey O’Brien Band (<span class=""caps"">LOB</span>)’s singular brand of soulful, high-energy rock & roll has been a staple of the Colorado music scene for more than six years.Their sound unites the drive of rock, the depth of folk, and the groove of soul—and throws in the get-up-and-dance of funk, a touch of jazz<br /> sophistication, and just enough pop to party to.

Comprised of Micah Schnabel (guitar/vocals), Shane Sweeney (bass/vocals), and Dustin Harigle (drums), the outfit, which plays more than 200 shows a year (and has for the past five years), has made their darkest, yet most rewarding record to date, writing songs that deal with the problems and dilemmas of growing up, coming to terms with ones dreams versus reality, as well as songs about the current state of the union and our political atmosphere, parades that end in death, and navigating the troubled waters of relationships. One song in particular that sums up the inner turbulence and confusion of being in a touring rock ‘n’ roll band while your friends all buy houses, get married, and start families, is ""No Shame"", a song in which Schnabel describes both the curse and pleasure of playing rock ‘n’ roll: ""There’s a guitar, that’s leaning on my wall, the instrument of my ultimate downfall. And notebooks scattered all over my floor. Six hundred pages all filled with regrets, and hundreds of songs that ain’t finished yet. And a job application getting harder to ignore."" But, as Sweeny puts it, describing a time when he ""questioned whether or not I wanted to be in Two Cow anymore. I was very angry. I really just wanted to explode but at the same time I was so incredibly disappointed I wanted to hide away and just give up."" Two Cow Garage’s solution when faced with problems like these, as Sweeney tells me is, ""Seeing as how neither one of those would have been very reasonable I wrote a song about it."" When down, questioning the band, or questioning themselves, each member of Two Cow Garage turns to the one thing they know, music, and it pulls them through. Enter ""III"", a record that has recharged and renewed the members of Two Cow Garage’s momentum, as they once again hit the road, even prior to the album’s April release date, gearing up to put a hundred thousand more miles on the van this year, and play 200 plus more shows at smoky bars.

With influences that range from African war chants to whistling, The Set is more than a band… they’re a revolution… disguised as a band. In the spring of 2010, the band released their debut five-song EP to earth-shattering critical acclaim. Not convinced? Here are some positive reviews: “The…set… [is good]” – Rolling Stone Magazine The Set’s recent emergence has been part of a lengthy evolution. The band came into fruition in part because of lead singer/guitarist Case Shannon’s years of traveling, writing, and individual recognition. In the years prior to The Set’s formation, Shannon was an established singer-songer, gaining accolades and exposure thanks to a solo showcase at SXSW in 2008 that lead to subsequent radio play on over 200 college radio stations.","<p>Aside from being the Lutefisk capital of the world, the Twin Cities didn’t have much to be proud of; that is, until The Set exploded onto the scene.

Here are some positive reviews:</p> <p>“The…set… [is good]” – Rolling Stone Magazine</p> <p>The Set’s recent emergence has been part of a lengthy evolution. The band came into fruition in part because of lead singer/guitarist Case Shannon’s years of traveling, writing, and individual recognition. In the years prior to The Set’s formation, Shannon was an established singer-songer, gaining accolades and exposure thanks to a solo showcase at <span class=""caps"">SXSW</span> in 2008 that lead to subsequent radio play on over 200 college radio stations.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7008967/the_set_cover_art_poster.jpg",""
"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/nimo-the-hooligan","Nimo The Hooligan","Minneapolis","","I have been a DJ/Turntablist since I was 14, started playing house parties and barbeques for friends and it only went on from there. Graduating to my first live performance in local venues like the, now deceased, Dinkytowner, Red Sea, Blue Nile, and the also now deceased, Urban Wild life. After highschool I immediately began college at The Institute of Production and Recording, this didn’t turn out well as I ended up dropping out after only one year to work, save, etc. But the vinyl never stopped spinning through all of it. Not long after leaving IPR I began delving deep into the local scene, meeting people and networking, getting on mixtapes and albums and sitting in at shows or open mics as often as possible. Also along the way, recording a great deal of original music, collaborating with my many music friends, and generally trying to find a semi permanent outlet in the form of one genre of music or another. This also proved to not work out well, as i have, and still do, play with many different genres of music. I also work independently as a Wedding and Event DJ which is a direction I would like to continue going in just for side work. I like to think that i have a Bruce Lee way of going about my musical endeavors, “The style of no style. Flow like water”. I simply wish to push the envelope, as many other DJ/Turntablists are doing, of the acceptable mediums for DJs and Turntablists in general. As of the last 5+ years, I have stayed busy with my friend and collaborator Nobuddie, playing hundreds of shows and recording equally as many tracks, waiting for the right time and material to release to the public. My other main project, is arguably, the funkiest super-group in the Twin Cities, P.B. & The Jam. Having been a band for less than 2 years, we have accomplished much, played much, written much, and have garnered a bunch of acclaim because of it all. I have also been featured on a revolutionary video game called Jam Party, in which the player gets to create/arrange/perform music from local and national artists (soon to be available on PC, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, Playstation 3, Iphones, and Androids). I have been blessed with great, talented friends… We as a state are blessed with an ever blossoming music and art community, which in turn blesses the individual artists and the fans for having a healthy, active music scene that attracts live acts from around the country and the world. I have had the blessing of being able to open/perform with many of my personal heros and influences, such as: Method Man/Redman Eyedea & Abilities POS of Doom Tree Prof/Fundo Joell Ortiz Tech N9ne D-12 DJ Logic Mr. Dibbs St. Paul Slim Bone Thugs n’ Harmony Wookiefoot Heatbox House of Pain/Everlast Cunninlynguists Greives Mac Lethal George Clinton/Parliment Soulcrate The Crest King Sandman Just to name a few… I have been able to meet alot of people, go alot of places, and do alot of amazing things. None of this mentions the amazing people that i have the pleasure and joy of performing with on a regular basis in the Twin Cities… big shout outs go to: Out of Bounds, Fill in The Breaks crew, Hecatomb, Stophouse, The Background Noize Crew, Option 2, Wide Eyes, Moonlight Grammar, Mercies May, Desdamona, Big Jess & Unknown Prophets, More than Lights, Bottom Feeders, New Reb, Jon Wayne & The Payne, Root City Band, and too many others to name.","<p>I have been a DJ/Turntablist since I was 14, started playing house parties and barbeques for friends and it only went on from there.

She released her third album, Wound & Will, on March 5, 2011, under the moniker Little Brave. To celebrate the release of the album, Stephanie decided to create an event unlike any other. She called it “Wound & Will: The Musical.” Each song had a theme, i.e. a ballerina on “The Invitation”; puppets on “Blame”; everyone wearing band uniforms on “Time To Forget.” She also recorded 9 transition tracks, which played while the stage was reset for each new song. The San Antonio Current said, “This was easily the best show I’ve seen so far this year, and it wasn’t about the confetti: it was about the songs and the vision of a top-notch all-around artist the regional music scene should be proud of.” She is currently organizing the “musical” for a second showing in Austin, TX.If you are enjoying the recordings, you’d be happy to know that Stephanie also PRODUCES her own albums.

Songs like the raucous “Wild” with its vibrantly chanted chorus will undoubtedly keep playing in your head long after the song is over. Equally as unforgettable is the reinvention of the hauntingly lovely “Heartbeats” by The Knife.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/audien","Audien","","","In the middle of a global explosion of Electronic Dance Music, a genre that thrives in the most exclusive nightclubs of the world’s cosmopolitan cities, a prodigious producer has emerged from the unlikeliest of places. The small seaport town of Mystic, Connecticut, has been the home of Audien (AKA Nate Rathbun) for his entire life, and it’s in a small apartment in Mystic where Audien began creating music in 2008. Using a very basic set up, and a secret cocktail of plug-ins, Audien worked diligently to hone his craft. By age 17, while his friends were either preparing college applications or teeing up jobs, Audien began to test the waters by sending his unsolicited music out to producers, labels & bloggers. Though confident in his sound, Audien carefully managed his expectations, suspecting it was unlikely that he’d hear back from a random demo submission. An enthusiastic response came, however, from Flashover Recordings, the trance label owned by beloved Dutch Producer/DJ Ferry Corsten. Audien’s single “Rise & Shine” was released, and soon thereafter he was off to the races.Over the next two years a slew of renowned labels came calling, gravitating to Audien’s stunning melodies & innovative sonic landscapes. Audien worked meticulously, but prolifically, churning out anthems & remixes for labels including Enhanced, Perceptive, Armada, Black Hole, Nervous, with tracks routinely charting on Beatport. Audien’s tracks also began to appear on compilations assembled by some of the genre’s giants, including Corsten’s Countdown, Tiesto’s Club Life, Above & Beyond’s Trance Around The World, and Armin Van Buuren’s A State of Trance. A particularly exciting opportunity presented itself in May of 2011, when Audien had the opportunity to open for Van Buuren at New York’s Roseland. In just 3 years, Audien had gone from idolizing Van Buuren to sharing a stage with him. As Audien has continued to release tracks into 2012, his music has evolved to include elements of Progressive House. The monster 2012 release These Are The Days was lauded by influential blog Dancing Astronaut as a “catchy summer anthem,” while The Top Sound noted “the combination of flawless evolution, beautiful piano chords, & trance-y plucks makes this an absolutely brilliant track.” Never straying far from his roots, Audien released his highly acclaimed songEventide on Anjunabeats in August of 2012. Audien’s relationship with Above & Beyond continued to blossom through the fall; in November, A&B premiered Audien’s track Wayfarer as the first ever song played on their new radio show, Above & Beyond Group Therapy. Elsewhere in November 2012, Audien released the incendiary progressive house track SUP, via Trice Recordings. SUP was featured by Dutch icon Hardwell on episode 87 of Hardwell On Air. Commenting on the track, Elektro magazine declared, “… this production takes its listeners on a roller coaster ride of uplifting synth progressions, chaotic builds, and hard, bouncing drops that holds the ability to move crowds wherever this banger is played.” Shortly after the track’s release, Audien joined Hardwell on tour for dates in New York & Boston. With his ability to create fresh tracks in auto-pilot, Audien has turned his attention to performing live, a craft he takes just a seriously as his production. Audien recently performed at some of the hottest clubs in the US including L.A.’s Exchange & Lure, San Francisco’s Ruby Skye & Harlot, New York’s Pacha, XS in Las Vegas, and Miami’s LIV. With more big shows forthcoming, Audien is ready to continue his rapid rise out of Mystic, and around the world.

Audien’s relationship with Above & Beyond continued to blossom through the fall; in November, A&B premiered Audien’s track Wayfarer as the first ever song played on their new radio show, Above & Beyond Group Therapy. <br><br>Elsewhere in November 2012, Audien released the incendiary progressive house track <span class=""caps"">SUP</span>, via Trice Recordings. <span class=""caps"">SUP</span> was featured by Dutch icon Hardwell on episode 87 of Hardwell On Air. Commenting on the track, Elektro magazine declared, “… this production takes its listeners on a roller coaster ride of uplifting synth progressions, chaotic builds, and hard, bouncing drops that holds the ability to move crowds wherever this banger is played.” Shortly after the track’s release, Audien joined Hardwell on tour for dates in New York & Boston. <br><br>With his ability to create fresh tracks in auto-pilot, Audien has turned his attention to performing live, a craft he takes just a seriously as his production. Audien recently performed at some of the hottest clubs in the US including L.A.’s Exchange & Lure, San Francisco’s Ruby Skye & Harlot, New York’s Pacha, XS in Las Vegas, and Miami’s <span class=""caps"">LIV</span>. With more big shows forthcoming, Audien is ready to continue his rapid rise out of Mystic, and around the world. <br><br></div><p></div><div style=""margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;""><div style=""margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Description</span></div>Discography can be found on Beatport! <br><br><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beatport.com%2F%23artist%2Faudien%2F121217&h=QAQHYD_e0&s=1"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.beatport.com/#artist/audien/121217</a><br><br><br>via Facebook</div></p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7156682/1f3d4cd99f34f0fabe31f2aca835f30b_poster.png","http://www.youtube.com/e/BKUzPM3DklA?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

Some are better than others…some, not so much. So, when I sat down with my gigantic cup of coffee to have a listen to a submission, I was crossing my fingers for something decent. Of all times I have crossed my fingers, finally it paid off. Dreampop band, The Sea Life, even made me set down my coffee so I could fully enjoy them. The Sea Life bring forth their lo-fi pop sound in such a charming way. I chose to feature ‘Sleep’ off their self titled EP. I love it’s heart, it’s sweet, sweet heart. A song about losing sleep over someone you can’t have, I’m sure we can all relate. The Sea Life are relatable. As I listened to their EP, I was able to connect personally to each song. I think that’s what music is supposed to be all about, right? – DINGUS MUSIC The first track entitled “Sleep” will tempt you to do anything but. The instrumentals are light and airy, with a twang of passive vocals almost similar to the nonchalant style of Weezer, but perhaps the most apparent aspect of this album is the ease about it. The track list is as reminiscent of teenage life as it is an average indie album. It stirs up thoughts about those sleepless nights, going over every detail in your head about whatever it is that you may have messed up and whether or not you care at all. It reminds you of the time you gave up on that significant moment or person and when you finally realized to get back up and do something about it. Most importantly, it reminds you of the careless things you did because there was nothing better to do, no one holding you back or telling you to think twice, and the fun of spontaneity leading you onward. The Sea Life EP is a soundtrack for the young and carefree at heart. It’s for the sleepless dreamers and indecisive thinkers. Above all, it’s the sound of the new age, independent generation. – INDIEMUSICREVIEWER","<p>http://www.indiemusicreviewer.com/the-sea-life-self-titled-ep/</p> <p>We get daily submissions sent to Dingus and if you’re wondering, yes, I do listen to them.

His first album,Too Long in the Wasteland (released in 1989), was produced by John Mellencamp and marked the beginning of a series of acclaimed projects for Columbia and Sugar Hill. In 1996, McMurtry received a Grammy nomination for his Longform Music Video ofWhere’d You Hide The Body. 1997’s It Had To Happen received the American Indie Award for Best Americana Album.In 2004, McMurtry released the universally lauded Live in Aught-Three on Compadre Records. 2005’s Childish Things garnered some of the highest critical praise of McMurtry’s career and spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Americana Music Radio Chart in 2005 and 2006. In September 2006, Childish Things and “We Can’t Make It Here” won the Americana Music Awards for Album and Song of the Year, respectively. McMurtry received more Americana Music Award nominations for 2008’s Just Us Kids. This album marked his highest Billboard 200 chart position in more than 19 years.In 2009, Live in Europe was released, capturing The McMurtry Band’s first European tour and extraordinary live set. Along with seasoned band members Ronnie Johnson, Daren Hess, and Tim Holt, the disc features special guests Ian McLagan and Jon Dee Graham. Also, for the first time ever, video of the James McMurtry Band’s live performance is available on the included DVD.The poignant lyrics of his immense catalog still ring true today. In 2011, “We Can’t Make It Here” was cited among ‘The Nation’s’ “Best Protest Songs Ever.” Bob Lefsetz writes, “‘We Can’t Make It Here’ has stood the test of time because of its unmitigated truth.”Never one to rest on his laurels, James McMurtry continues to tour constantly, and consistently puts on a “must-see” powerhouse performance. ‘The Washington Post’ noted McMurtry’s live prowess: “Much attention is paid to James McMurtry’s lyrics, and rightfully so: He creates a novel’s worth of emotion and experience in four minutes of blisteringly stark couplets. What gets overlooked, however, is that he’s an accomplished rock guitar player. At a sold-out Birchmere, the Austin-based artist was joined by drummer Daren Hess and bassist Ronnie Johnson in a set that demonstrated the raw power of wince-inducing imagery propelled by electric guitar.

HalleyAnna’s superb debut collection swaggers (“So Heavy”) and sways (“Fast Train”) with effortless elegance. The album, which deftly spotlights her meeting point between Patsy Cline and Emmylou Harris, serves as a shining introduction to a skyward bound emerging talent. High watermarks – particularly, “Back in Your Arms Again” and “Peace Is Lonely, Love Is War”– already show HalleyAnna growing exponentially sharp as a songwriter.“Experience is what happens when you don’t get what you want, so songwriting makes me feel better,” she says. “Any time I’d go through a heartache growing up, my dad would say, ‘Well, you’ll get a good song out of it.’ Sure enough, I really did. You can’t write every single song about how somebody broke your heart, so some of the stuff I’ve done is more serious. ‘Back in Your Arms Again’ may sound like a song about somebody who dumped you, but it has a much deeper, eternal, death-related theme about meeting in the next life.”For the last decade, HalleyAnna has honed her songwriting skills at Cheatham Street Warehouse, the legendary Central Texas listening room owned by her father, singer-songwriter Kent Finlay. She now leads the next generation of compelling writers who follow James McMurtry, Todd Snider, Bruce Robison and others who started out at Cheatham Street. “I grew up listening to people who play music in Texas,” says the youthful singer-songwriter. “I really love the traditional stuff that’s going on in East Nashville like Elizabeth Cook and Caitlin Rose and Hayes Carll and Slaid Cleaves here in Austin. They embody the same traditional country that I like.”All personify the literate storytelling so identified with the Texas music tradition and HalleyAnna has put her creative writing studies to good use following their footsteps. Look for further proof one her sophomore effort (due in early 2013). Americana all-star Bill Chambers (Kasey’s father) produced the collection. “Working with Bill is so easy and great,” HalleyAnna says. “Bill came up and was here for the summer touring with Kasey and he had about a week window to make a record with me. He brought this really nice microphone that Kasey used on ‘The Captain’ and ‘Barricades and Brickwalls’ and we did vocals pretty much live.

Out of Cleveland’s hard rock/metal dominated music scene, Winslow’s award winning sound has gained the band praise, loyal growing fan base, and the reputation of one of the Midwest’s rising musical acts. Voted Cleveland’s Best Original Band, Winslow’s unique blend of soul, funk, rock and jazz has been described by many members of the press and fans alike as a musical breath of fresh air. This sound, combined with the 6-piece outfit’s polished and passionate stage show has led them to sharing the stage with such major acts as Incubus, Earth Wind & Fire, OAR, Robert Randolph, Keane, Mat Kearney, Rusted Root, and many more. Following the successful release of the band’s 2008 debut Album, which featured collaboration with legendary keyboardist Bernie Worrell (Parliament/Funkadelic and The Talking Heads) the band has now set their sights on a heavily awaited sophomore album.

This sound, combined with the 6-piece outfit’s polished and passionate stage show has led them to sharing the stage with such major acts as Incubus, Earth Wind & Fire, <span class=""caps"">OAR</span>, Robert Randolph, Keane, Mat Kearney, Rusted Root, and many more.</p> <p>Following the successful release of the band’s 2008 debut Album, which featured collaboration with legendary keyboardist Bernie Worrell (Parliament/Funkadelic and The Talking Heads) the band has now set their sights on a heavily awaited sophomore album.

Inspired by a theme from Moby Dick, the band’s name alone is enough to make underpaid Literature teachers beam with pride. It all started with two musicians — Aaron Smith and Michael LoPresti — who decided to collaborate in a field one sunny afternoon because that seemed nicer than playing in a basement. By the end of the day they had written their first song. They gave it a profound name: “The Field Song.” When it was selected for a Paste Sampler CD, Aaron and Michael decided to make a proper run at it.The Lighthouse and the Whaler released a four-song EP in 2008 and a self-titled/produced/released album in 2009. Two songs from that album — “White Days” and “Under Mountain, Under Ground” — found their way to TV and radio. With more fans to play for, The Lighthouse and the Whaler hit the road and toured across America. Somewhere between Boston and Seattle, the band picked up three new members — Matthew, Mark and Steve – thereafter, fulfilling the prophesy that was to be five young men stuffed in a forest green Chevy Venture, searching for open ears and loyal hearts.Here is what most band bios won’t tell you:Michael LoPresti studied literature and theology in college but rushed home after graduation to become a musician. Michael is the voice of the band and his head is filled with wayward melodies one could chase for days. He wears boat shoes, jean cut-offs and flannel shirts all year round. Michael is a web designer and has approximately two dance moves. Put a chick flick on mute and he will make up hilarious new dialogue to go along with the picture. Aaron Smith is self-taught on the violin, guitar and keys. He is a skeptic, searching for each perfect note as it passes. Aaron has deadpan wit and incredibly white teeth. He eats Chia seeds and dried prunes to stay healthy on the road. Aaron is acutely aware of subtle details and often finds himself lost in his thoughts for long periods of time. He is a gentle giant, but is self-conscious about his height. And yes, he is single. Matthew LoPresti was on his way to becoming a professional soccer player but left the pitch to join The Lighthouse and the Whaler. Matthew is a percussionist and puts the passion and heart into the songs. He has a nice smile and often requires extra space on stage to accommodate his raw emotion. Matthew tells loud jokes because it makes everyone laugh more. He thinks LeBron James is a traitor and is dogmatic on the subject.Mark Poro was a solo artist who wanted some company. He plays mandolin, violin, guitar, piano and glockenspiel, but has yet to master the triangle. Mark is a lover of the poignant and sincere, and fills each song with his pure spirit. He secretly likes to be silly, especially in serious situations. Mark is perpetually training for a marathon and has blue eyes that would remind a sailor of a calm day at sea. Mark Poro is not his real name.Steve Diaz is originally from Virginia and met Mark at a music conservatory on Martha’s Vineyard. He moved to Ohio to become a Whaler, but otherwise would have probably become a farmer. Steve is a born composer and adds contrast and depth to the music with a seasoned subtlety. Steve can grow a glorious reddish-brown beard, which he credits to his unique ancestry. He writes music to maintain his sanity. Steve is not homeless, though he sometimes looks it. The Lighthouse and the Whaler plays indie-folk-pop and does not believe that genre labels tell you anything you need to know about a band. It has nevertheless caught the attention of MTV, Fuse, FILTER, Spinner, Under the Radar and other media outlets that cater to indie-folk-pop music fans.The Lighthouse and the Whaler has performed at venues like House of Blues, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Rockwood Music Hall and SXSW, though its favorite show to date took place in the attic of an old bookstore. The band has also shared stages with Sufjan Stevens, The Temper Trap and The Dodos, and shared blankets while sleeping in its donated mini-van, inappropriately named Rihanna.John Richards of KEXP called The Lighthouse and the Whaler his new favorite band. He may be the smartest man on the planet.","<p>The Lighthouse and the Whaler is a band from Cleveland, Ohio, though its name alludes to the waters off the coast of Massachusetts.

Tastemaker media such as Pitchfork, The Guardian and NME wrote about her and she just returned home from CMJ in New York after playing some widely praised shows. With no albums out and only 2 online tracks the 23-year- old MØ recently faced a bidding war, which ultimately led to signing with Sony for the Scandinavian territory. Now MØ is being pursued by some of the most respectable labels in the UK and US. Scandinavia, it seems, has done it again! MØ is spending the fall in the studio, wrapping up her highly anticipated debut album with Ronni Vindahl of Danish producer entity No Wav. Listeners can expect a lush, warm and soulful production, however MØ brings the Scandinavian cold/cool and a street vibe edge to the songs, which makes for a sonic juxtaposition. Her unique mix of indie, pop, hip-hop, electro and soul is hella fresh sounding and it genuinely sounds like MØ is fighting a battle of mixed emotions inside of herself. The Guardian named MØ ’band of the day’ and hailed her as ’the next Grimes’ and having played alongside acts such as Purity Ring and MS MR, it seems like MØ might just be the next indie act to break through to the mainstream masses. There is not much info out there on MØ who tends to let her music do the talking, but her facebook biography reveals a glimpse of her current state of mind: ”The snow nation is eating your brain and your young heart – dark as the apocalypse.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/heidi-happy","Heidi Happy","Luzern, Switz","singer-songwriter, female vocalists, swiss","HEIDI HAPPY BIOGRAPHY (ENGLISH) Within six years and three abums, swiss singer-songwriter Heidi Happy evolved from a folkie flowergirl to a mature composer for band and orchestra. The outstanding singer from the countryside of Lucerne is not only a major figure in Swiss pop music, but a fascinatingly creative artist with international success. To a wide and ever growing audience, Heidi Happy has been known as a renowned swiss songwriter with a preference for orchestral music. However, the 31 year-old Lucerne resident is an artist who not only writes, arranges and produces her music, but who also designs her websites and co-directs her videos. Which is unusual, particularly if you consider that she was only supposed to give but one single concert. But after this gig in April 2005 equipped with an acoustic guitar, a loop machine and a floor lamp, her name would appear on more and more flyers. On her first album Back Together (2007) Ms. Happy presented heself as a playful folk-girlie. Smooth vocals, coy lyrics and flowery videos portrayed the image of a newcomer who, thanks to hits like Back Together, was euphorically greeted by the media but wouldn’t take herself all too serious. All self-mockery, however, could not conceal the exceptional talent in this outstanding young singer and songwriter. This was noted by promoters and the public in Europe and the U.S., too, which lead Heidi Happy to a long stretch of live shows. The album was recorded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where Ms. Happy was completing her studies in audio-visual communication. Therefore the self-designed booklets and websites, and therefore her directing the video to Du da, ich da, which was part of her diploma. In 2008 Ms. Happy returned to Switzerland and released Flowers, Birds, and Home. The transitional album, as she calls it today, pointed out the way to go. The songs still sounded airy and centered around the vocals and the guitar, but you could also hear a greater lyrical seriousness and an increased complexity in the arrangements. For the recording and the following tour, Ms. Happy assembled some of Switzerland’s most respected young musicians: With Ephrem Lüchinger (keys), Gregor Heini (guitar), André Pousaz (stand-up bass) and Arno Troxler (drums), Heidi Happy played increasingly bigger stages all over the world, and her albums got released in Germany, Austria, Canada and Japan. At the same time she became a congenial singing partner for respected and upcoming artists like Yello, Stephan Eicher, The Sad Riders, Zwicker, Favez, Coal and Monotales. But where did all this music come from? As a child, young Heidi used to record songs on a tape deck with as many instruments as possible; she was intrigued by the diversity of sounds. Her mother instructed her to play the piano when she was seven, at nine she took to the cello, and later on she taught herself to play the guitar. The foundation for her love for orchestral music was laid in the back country of Lucerne it would soon be heard all around. With her third album Hiding with the Wolves (2011) Heidi Happy fulfilled herself a dream: writing a piece for a whole orchestra. There had been instruments like vibraphones or kettle drums on her recordings before, but such a symphonic album was unheard of in Switzerland. Ms. Happy had retired to compose to the shores of lake Untersee for four months, returning with material for an album that presented her as an adult, serious songwriter. The lyrics were deeper, they told of the downsides of life and love and the potholes in roads taken alone. With Charlie Zimmermann on guitar, the band was enlarged with the Ensemble Camerata Musica (Lucerne). After recording, Ms. Happy flew to L.A. to get her album mixed by Andrew Scheps and mastered by Bernie Grundman. The west coast provided the setting for the video to Sarah, which she again co-produced with her friend Corina Schwingruber. The effort was worthwile: With Hiding with the Wolves she moved to the the famous Two Gentlemen label, the critics were raving, and the premiere took place in Lausanne with a big orhestra. It’s been quite a way from folky flowerchild to mature songwriter and it was worth taking. With this album for band and orchestra, Heidi Happy presents herself in all her diversity, and in full bloom. HEIDI HAPPY BIOGRAFIE (DEUTSCH) In sechs Jahren und drei Alben hat sich Heidi Happy vom blumigen Folk-Girl zu einer reifen Komponistin für Band und Orchester entwickelt. Die hervorragende Sängerin gehört prägt mit ihrer aussergewöhnlichen Musik die Schweizer Popmusik und feiert internationale Erfolge. Heidi Happy ist einem breiten Publikum bekannt als eigenwillige Singer-Songwriterin mit einer Vorliebe für Orchestermusik. Die 30-jährige Luzernerin ist eine Frau, die nicht nur ihre Musik selber schreibt, arrangiert und produziert, sondern auch ihre Webseiten designt und ihre Videos mitkonzipiert. Dabei war eigentlich war nur ein einziges Konzert vorgesehen. Doch nach einem Auftritt im April 2005 mit Gitarre, Loopgerät und Stehlampe begann Heidi Happys Name auf immer mehr Flyern und Programmheften zu stehen. Auf ihrem ersten Album Back Together (2007) präsentierte sich Heidi Happy als kindlich-verspieltes Folk-Girl. Sanfte Stimme, neckische Texte und blumige Videos zeichneten das Bild einer Newcomerin, die dank Hits wie Back Together von den Medien euphorisch begrüsst wurde, sich selber aber nicht übermässig ernst nahm. Alle Selbstironie konnte aber nicht verbergen, dass hier eine aussergewöhnlich gute Sängerin und Komponistin heranreifte. Das fanden auch Hörerinnen und Veranstalter in ganz Europa und den USA, wo Heidy Happy eine Menge Konzerte gab. Aufgenommen hatte Heidi Happy das Album in der Nähe von Amsterdam, denn dort hatte sie an der Kunstschule audiovisuelle Gestaltung studiert. Daher die selber designten CD-Booklets und Webseiten, und daher auch ihre Regiearbeit zum Video Du da, ich da, das Teil ihrer Abschlussarbeit war. 2008 kehrte Heidi Happy aus Holland zurück in die Schweiz und veröffentlichte Flowers, Birds, and Home. Das Übergangsalbum, wie sie es heute nennt, machte klar, wohin die musikalische Entwicklung gehen würde. Die Lieder klangen immer noch leicht und luftig, Stimme und akustische Gitarre standen immer noch im Zentrum, aber gegenüber dem Debüt waren komplexere Arrangements und eine gesteigerte Ernsthaftigkeit zu hören. Für Aufnahmen und Tour scharte Heidi Happy hervorragende Musiker um sich: Zusammen mit Ephrem Lüchinger (Tasten), Gregor Heini (Gitarre), André Pousaz (Kontrabass) und Arno Troxler (Drums) bespielte Heidi Happy auf der ganzen Welt Bühnen, die immer grösser wurden. Ihre Alben kamen mittlerweile in Deutschland, Österreich, Kanada und Japan heraus. Gleichzeitig entwickelte sie sich zu einer kongenialen Gastsängerin: Heidi Happy veredelte Stücke von Yello, Stephan Eicher, The Sad Riders, Coal und Monotales. Aber woher kam eigentlich die Musik? Schon als Kind bespielte die kleine Heidi Kassetten mit eigenen Songs und möglichst vielen Instrumenten, die Vielfalt faszinierte sie. Ihren ersten Klavierunterricht hatte sie mit sieben bei ihrer Mutter. Mit neun spielte sie Cello, später brachte sie sich selber das Gitarrenspiel bei. Der Grundstein für die Liebe zum Orchester war gelegt sie sollte bald weitum hörbar sein. Mit ihrem dritten Album Hiding with the Wolves erfüllte sich Heidi Happy 2011 den Kindheitstraum, ein Werk für ein ganzes Orchester zu schreiben. Schon auf ihren ersten zwei Alben waren Instrumente wie Pauke oder Vibraphon zu hören. Doch ein derart symphonisches Popalbum hatte die Schweiz noch nicht gehört. Vier Monate hatte sie sich an den Untersee zurückgezogen und in völliger Abgeschiedenheit ein Album komponiert, das sie als reife Songwriterin und ernst zu nehmende Komponistin präsentierte. Die Texte sind komplexer geworden, sie behandeln nun auch die dunklen Seiten der Liebe und die Schlaglöcher auf Wegen, die man alleine geht. Die Band, neu mit Charlie Zimmermann an der Gitarre, wurde erweitert um das Luzerner Ensemble Camerata Musica. Nach den Aufnahmen flog Heidi Happy nach Los Angeles, um die Platte mit Andrew Scheps zu mischen und von Bernie Grundman mastern zu lassen. An der US-Westküste produzierte sie zusammen mit ihrer Freundin Corina Schwingruber den Videoclip zur ersten Single Sarah. Der Aufwand hat sich gelohnt: Mit Hiding with the Wolves zog Heidi Happy zum renommierten Label Two Gentlemen, das Medienecho war hervorragend, und die Uraufführung fand in Lausanne mit grossem Orcheser statt. Es war ein langer Weg vom folkigen Blumenkind zur reifen Songwriterin und er hat sich gelohnt. Mit diesem Album für Band und Orchester präsentiert sich Heidi Happy in all ihrer Vielseitigkeit und in voller Blüte. PRESS RELEASE ENGLISH HEIDI HAPPY, Hiding With The Wolves Most people would be content with the career that Heidi Happy had made for herself. Two albums, a growing success not only nationally but also in Japan, the USA, Canada and Europe based on a strong musical identity of playful pop spiked with strings. The acclaim for the cute, fun persona she had created was growing. But Heidi Happy, thank God, is not most people. Aiming for a challenge that would put to good use her love and knowledge of classical arrangements, her innate sense of musical beauty and her soft, delicate song crafting, she set herself to work on a true, honest and ambitious classical pop album. Retreating to the frozen Lake of Constance, she locked up her house and let go of an array of emotions she had, as of yet, kept her songs protected from. Secluded, visited by the slow, curious animals of winter and later by the lively beasts of spring, old stories long forgotten came to life again. Day by day, she carved her words into the fascinating fabrics of a symphonic orchestra, illuminating them with the modern gravitas of her evolving folk songwriting sensitivities. Not unlike a youthful, female Ennio Morricone or an emotional early sixties Frank Sinatra, she wrote, composed and arranged an album of sensual innocence, of immense purity, of sophisticated abandon. Along with the stellar songwriting and that ever so beautiful voice, what makes this record so endearing is the understated use of the orchestra. Unlike so many pop artists who fall into the trap of overblown Disney style arrangements, Heidi Happy uses the classical instruments as they were meant to be, an elegant accompaniment of velvet strings and muffled brass, never overshadowing the band, always complementing the song. That she could guide so many musicians to create a work of such staggering intimacy might be the biggest tour de force of this young woman. From a house on the frozen shores of a small Swiss lake to a gigantic classical studio to the Los Angeles mixing desk of Andrew Scheps (known for his work with Johnny Cash or My Brightest Diamond) to the mastering rooms of Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson), Heidi Happy has stayed true to the purity of her vision and has created a timeless album. Her songs of love, loss, ports and horse rides are as haunting as the nature that surrounded their birth, as precious and innocent as the voice that gave them life and as beautifully soothing as the spring that will see them released at last. PRESS RELEASE GERMAN HEIDI HAPPY, Hiding With The Wolves In ihrem dritten Album nimmt uns Heidi Happy mit auf einen fantastischen Traumflug. Neben der Band ist diesmal ein ganzes Orchester mit dabei, ausserdem wilde Tiere und sehr viel Herz. Die Schweizer Künstlerin fliegt mit «Hiding With The Wolves» konsequent auf ihrer eigenen Bahn weiter. Mit «Back Together»(2007) blühte eine Blume auf, in «Flowers, Birds and Home» (2009) spielten Vögel, Hasen und Rehe auf der Wiese. Nun wagt sich Heidi Happy mit Wölfen in den Wunderwald. Und sie lässt in diesem poetischen Gelände Klassik und Pop zusammen tanzen. Die Schweizer Songwriterin überrascht mit einem mutigen Epos. «Hiding With The Wolves» ist weit mehr als eine Reihe mit Streichern untermalte Popsongs, sondern ein originelles musikalisches Kunstwerk für Band und Orchester, ein klassischer Soundtrack zu einem Kino der Gefühle. In Heidi Happys zauberhaften Welten fühlt man sich zuhause und wird von den Stimmungen überwältigt. Das Herzenserlebnis erinnert an den Meister Ennio Morricone, Joni Mitchell oder an den Sound von Frank Sinatra. Das berührende Werk entstand in der Abgeschiedenheit am Ufer des Bodensees und erhielt in Los Angeles den letzten Schliff. Wie bereits bei ihren ersten beiden Alben schrieb, komponierte und arrangierte Heidi Happy alle Songs selbst. Musikalisch klettert sie dabei eine Stufe weiter. Band und klassische Instrumente setzt sie gleichberechtigt, unkonventionell und voller sanfter Effekte ein. Die Arrangements sind dabei so fein und liebevoll, dass Heidi Happys Sound intim bleibt. Durch diesen kunstvoll gewobenen, federleichten Klangstoff strahlt Heidi Happys Stimme in ihrer ganzen Vielfalt. Melancholie war nie so zärtlich, tröstlich, frech. Es ist Musik, um zuhause in verflossener Liebe zu schwelgen. Ihren grossartigen Bandmusikern ist Heidi übrigens treu geblieben. Gemischt wurde «Hiding With The Wolves» vom Ton-Ingenieur Andrew Scheps (Johnny Cash, My Brightest Diamond), das Mastering besorgte Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson). Bereits Heidi Happys zweites Album erschien in Europa, Japan und Kanada. Seit 2009 spielte sie rund um die Welt und sang unter anderem mit Yello, Coal, Stephan Eicher, D-Sisive, Monotales, The Sad Riders, Handsome Hank und Zwicker. Jetzt erobert Heidi Happy furchtlos weitere Sphären und beschert ihrem Publikum damit fabelhafte Momente von grenzenlosem Glück. PRESS RELEASE FRENCH HEIDI HAPPY, Hiding With The Wolves La plupart des gens se contenteraient de la carrière que Heidi Happy s’est forgée. Deux albums, un succès grandissant non seulement en Suisse mais aussi au Japon, aux USA, au Canada et en Europe, une identité forte faite de morceaux pop aux ludiques arrangements de cordes, une personnalité gaie et fraîche, la machine était en marche. Mais Heidi Happy, Dieu merci, n’est pas comme la plupart des gens. Toujours à la recherche d’un nouveau challenge qui pourrait mettre à profit son amour et sa science des arrangements classiques, son sens inné de la mélodie et son songwriting délicat, elle s’est attelée à la confection d’un album de pop orchestrée ambitieux et sincère. Terrée dans une maison côtière sise sur les bords du lac de Constance, elle s’est libérée d’un trop plein d’émotions jusqu’alors retenues. Visitée par les vents froids du soir, par les curieux animaux de l’hiver puis par ceux que le printemps avait éveillés, elle a laissé remonter de vieilles histoires qu’elle croyait à tout jamais enfouies. Jour après jour, elle a joint ses mots simples et personnels aux sonorités fascinantes d’un orchestre symphonique, illuminant le tout de sa sensibilité folk florissante. A l’instar d’un Ennio Morricone ou d’un Frank Sinatra, la féminité et la juvénilité en plus, elle a écrit, composé et arrangé un album tout empreint de pureté, d’innocence sensuelle, de délassement sophistiqué. Aux côtés de cette voix bouleversante et de ces chansons envoutantes, ce qui rend cet album particulièrement fascinant se trouve dans l’utilisation tout en légèreté de l’orchestre symphonique. Alors que tant d’artistes pop tombent dans le piège de la facilité, dans les pompeux arrangements à la Walt Disney, Heidi Happy place ses instruments classiques en finesse. Un subtil accompagnement de cordes veloutées, de cuivres élégants qui complètent délicatement la voix sans jamais prendre le pas sur le groupe. Que cette jeune femme ait su diriger tant de musiciens pour créer un oeuvre si intime est sans doute son plus prodigieux accomplissement. D’une maison au bord du lac de Constance au studio de mastering de Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson) en passant par la gigantesque salle d’enregistrement d’un studio classique et par la table de mixage d’Andrew Scheps (réputé pour son travail avec Johnny Cash ou My Brightest Diamond), Heidi Happy est restée fidèle à la pureté de sa vision. Ses chansons d’amours perdues, de ports abandonnés et de chevaux errants sont aussi précieuses, innocentes et naturelles que leur interprète. Un album apaisant, réconfortant qui vous hantera longtemps.","<p><span class=""caps"">HEIDI</span> <span class=""caps"">HAPPY</span> <span class=""caps"">BIOGRAPHY</span> (<span class=""caps"">ENGLISH</span>)</p> <p>Within six years and three abums, swiss singer-songwriter Heidi Happy evolved from a folkie flowergirl to a mature composer for band and orchestra.

The transitional album, as she calls it today, pointed out the way to go. The songs still sounded airy and centered around the vocals and the guitar, but you could also hear a greater lyrical seriousness and an increased complexity in the arrangements. For the recording and the following tour, Ms. Happy assembled some of Switzerland’s most respected young musicians: With Ephrem Lüchinger (keys), Gregor Heini (guitar), André Pousaz (stand-up bass) and Arno Troxler (drums), Heidi Happy played increasingly bigger stages all over the world, and her albums got released in Germany, Austria, Canada and Japan. At the same time she became a congenial singing partner for respected and upcoming artists like Yello, Stephan Eicher, The Sad Riders, Zwicker, Favez, Coal and Monotales. <br /> But where did all this music come from? As a child, young Heidi used to record songs on a tape deck with as many instruments as possible; she was intrigued by the diversity of sounds. Her mother instructed her to play the piano when she was seven, at nine she took to the cello, and later on she taught herself to play the guitar. The foundation for her love for orchestral music was laid in the back country of Lucerne it would soon be heard all around. <br /> With her third album Hiding with the Wolves (2011) Heidi Happy fulfilled herself a dream: writing a piece for a whole orchestra. There had been instruments like vibraphones or kettle drums on her recordings before, but such a symphonic album was unheard of in Switzerland. Ms. Happy had retired to compose to the shores of lake Untersee for four months, returning with material for an album that presented her as an adult, serious songwriter. The lyrics were deeper, they told of the downsides of life and love and the potholes in roads taken alone. With Charlie Zimmermann on guitar, the band was enlarged with the Ensemble Camerata Musica (Lucerne). After recording, Ms. Happy flew to L.A. to get her album mixed by Andrew Scheps and mastered by Bernie Grundman. The west coast provided the setting for the video to Sarah, which she again co-produced with her friend Corina Schwingruber. The effort was worthwile: With Hiding with the Wolves she moved to the the famous Two Gentlemen label, the critics were raving, and the premiere took place in Lausanne with a big orhestra. <br /> It’s been quite a way from folky flowerchild to mature songwriter and it was worth taking. With this album for band and orchestra, Heidi Happy presents herself in all her diversity, and in full bloom.</p> <p><span class=""caps"">HEIDI</span> <span class=""caps"">HAPPY</span> <span class=""caps"">BIOGRAFIE</span> (<span class=""caps"">DEUTSCH</span>)</p> <p>In sechs Jahren und drei Alben hat sich Heidi Happy vom blumigen Folk-Girl zu einer reifen Komponistin für Band und Orchester entwickelt. Die hervorragende Sängerin gehört prägt mit ihrer aussergewöhnlichen Musik die Schweizer Popmusik und feiert internationale Erfolge.</p> <p>Heidi Happy ist einem breiten Publikum bekannt als eigenwillige Singer-Songwriterin mit einer Vorliebe für Orchestermusik. Die 30-jährige Luzernerin ist eine Frau, die nicht nur ihre Musik selber schreibt, arrangiert und produziert, sondern auch ihre Webseiten designt und ihre Videos mitkonzipiert. Dabei war eigentlich war nur ein einziges Konzert vorgesehen. Doch nach einem Auftritt im April 2005 mit Gitarre, Loopgerät und Stehlampe begann Heidi Happys Name auf immer mehr Flyern und Programmheften zu stehen.</p> <p>Auf ihrem ersten Album Back Together (2007) präsentierte sich Heidi Happy als kindlich-verspieltes Folk-Girl. Sanfte Stimme, neckische Texte und blumige Videos zeichneten das Bild einer Newcomerin, die dank Hits wie Back Together von den Medien euphorisch begrüsst wurde, sich selber aber nicht übermässig ernst nahm. Alle Selbstironie konnte aber nicht verbergen, dass hier eine aussergewöhnlich gute Sängerin und Komponistin heranreifte. Das fanden auch Hörerinnen und Veranstalter in ganz Europa und den <span class=""caps"">USA</span>, wo Heidy Happy eine Menge Konzerte gab. Aufgenommen hatte Heidi Happy das Album in der Nähe von Amsterdam, denn dort hatte sie an der Kunstschule audiovisuelle Gestaltung studiert. Daher die selber designten CD-Booklets und Webseiten, und daher auch ihre Regiearbeit zum Video Du da, ich da, das Teil ihrer Abschlussarbeit war.</p> <p>2008 kehrte Heidi Happy aus Holland zurück in die Schweiz und veröffentlichte Flowers, Birds, and Home. Das Übergangsalbum, wie sie es heute nennt, machte klar, wohin die musikalische Entwicklung gehen würde. Die Lieder klangen immer noch leicht und luftig, Stimme und akustische Gitarre standen immer noch im Zentrum, aber gegenüber dem Debüt waren komplexere Arrangements und eine gesteigerte Ernsthaftigkeit zu hören. Für Aufnahmen und Tour scharte Heidi Happy hervorragende Musiker um sich: Zusammen mit Ephrem Lüchinger (Tasten), Gregor Heini (Gitarre), André Pousaz (Kontrabass) und Arno Troxler (Drums) bespielte Heidi Happy auf der ganzen Welt Bühnen, die immer grösser wurden. Ihre Alben kamen mittlerweile in Deutschland, Österreich, Kanada und Japan heraus. Gleichzeitig entwickelte sie sich zu einer kongenialen Gastsängerin: Heidi Happy veredelte Stücke von Yello, Stephan Eicher, The Sad Riders, Coal und Monotales.</p> <p>Aber woher kam eigentlich die Musik? Schon als Kind bespielte die kleine Heidi Kassetten mit eigenen Songs und möglichst vielen Instrumenten, die Vielfalt faszinierte sie. Ihren ersten Klavierunterricht hatte sie mit sieben bei ihrer Mutter. Mit neun spielte sie Cello, später brachte sie sich selber das Gitarrenspiel bei. Der Grundstein für die Liebe zum Orchester war gelegt sie sollte bald weitum hörbar sein.</p> <p>Mit ihrem dritten Album Hiding with the Wolves erfüllte sich Heidi Happy 2011 den Kindheitstraum, ein Werk für ein ganzes Orchester zu schreiben. Schon auf ihren ersten zwei Alben waren Instrumente wie Pauke oder Vibraphon zu hören. Doch ein derart symphonisches Popalbum hatte die Schweiz noch nicht gehört. Vier Monate hatte sie sich an den Untersee zurückgezogen und in völliger Abgeschiedenheit ein Album komponiert, das sie als reife Songwriterin und ernst zu nehmende Komponistin präsentierte. Die Texte sind komplexer geworden, sie behandeln nun auch die dunklen Seiten der Liebe und die Schlaglöcher auf Wegen, die man alleine geht. Die Band, neu mit Charlie Zimmermann an der Gitarre, wurde erweitert um das Luzerner Ensemble Camerata Musica. Nach den Aufnahmen flog Heidi Happy nach Los Angeles, um die Platte mit Andrew Scheps zu mischen und von Bernie Grundman mastern zu lassen. An der US-Westküste produzierte sie zusammen mit ihrer Freundin Corina Schwingruber den Videoclip zur ersten Single Sarah. Der Aufwand hat sich gelohnt: Mit Hiding with the Wolves zog Heidi Happy zum renommierten Label Two Gentlemen, das Medienecho war hervorragend, und die Uraufführung fand in Lausanne mit grossem Orcheser statt.</p> <p>Es war ein langer Weg vom folkigen Blumenkind zur reifen Songwriterin und er hat sich gelohnt. Mit diesem Album für Band und Orchester präsentiert sich Heidi Happy in all ihrer Vielseitigkeit und in voller Blüte.</p> <hr /> <p><span class=""caps"">PRESS</span> <span class=""caps"">RELEASE</span> <span class=""caps"">ENGLISH</span></p> <p><span class=""caps"">HEIDI</span> <span class=""caps"">HAPPY</span>, Hiding With The Wolves</p> <p>Most people would be content with the career that Heidi Happy had made for herself. Two albums, a growing success not only nationally but also in Japan, the <span class=""caps"">USA</span>, Canada and Europe based on a strong musical identity of playful pop spiked with strings. The acclaim for the cute, fun persona she had created was growing. But Heidi Happy, thank God, is not most people.</p> <p>Aiming for a challenge that would put to good use her love and knowledge of classical arrangements, her innate sense of musical beauty and her soft, delicate song crafting, she set herself to work on a true, honest and ambitious classical pop album. Retreating to the frozen Lake of Constance, she locked up her house and let go of an array of emotions she had, as of yet, kept her songs protected from. Secluded, visited by the slow, curious animals of winter and later by the lively beasts of spring, old stories long forgotten came to life again. Day by day, she carved her words into the fascinating fabrics of a symphonic orchestra, illuminating them with the modern gravitas of her evolving folk songwriting sensitivities. Not unlike a youthful, female Ennio Morricone or an emotional early sixties Frank Sinatra, she wrote, composed and arranged an album of sensual innocence, of immense purity, of sophisticated abandon.</p> <p>Along with the stellar songwriting and that ever so beautiful voice, what makes this record so endearing is the understated use of the orchestra. Unlike so many pop artists who fall into the trap of overblown Disney style arrangements, Heidi Happy uses the classical instruments as they were meant to be, an elegant accompaniment of velvet strings and muffled brass, never overshadowing the band, always complementing the song. That she could guide so many musicians to create a work of such staggering intimacy might be the biggest tour de force of this young woman.</p> <p>From a house on the frozen shores of a small Swiss lake to a gigantic classical studio to the Los Angeles mixing desk of Andrew Scheps (known for his work with Johnny Cash or My Brightest Diamond) to the mastering rooms of Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson), Heidi Happy has stayed true to the purity of her vision and has created a timeless album. Her songs of love, loss, ports and horse rides are as haunting as the nature that surrounded their birth, as precious and innocent as the voice that gave them life and as beautifully soothing as the spring that will see them released at last.</p> <p><span class=""caps"">PRESS</span> <span class=""caps"">RELEASE</span> <span class=""caps"">GERMAN</span></p> <p><span class=""caps"">HEIDI</span> <span class=""caps"">HAPPY</span>, Hiding With The Wolves</p> <p>In ihrem dritten Album nimmt uns Heidi Happy mit auf einen fantastischen Traumflug. Neben der Band ist diesmal ein ganzes Orchester mit dabei, ausserdem wilde Tiere und sehr viel Herz. <br /> Die Schweizer Künstlerin fliegt mit «Hiding With The Wolves» konsequent auf ihrer eigenen Bahn weiter.</p> <p>Mit «Back Together»(2007) blühte eine Blume auf, in «Flowers, Birds and Home» (2009) spielten Vögel, Hasen und Rehe auf der Wiese. Nun wagt sich Heidi Happy mit Wölfen in den Wunderwald. Und sie lässt in diesem poetischen Gelände Klassik und Pop zusammen tanzen.</p> <p>Die Schweizer Songwriterin überrascht mit einem mutigen Epos. «Hiding With The Wolves» ist weit mehr als eine Reihe mit Streichern untermalte Popsongs, sondern ein originelles musikalisches Kunstwerk für Band und Orchester, ein klassischer Soundtrack zu einem Kino der Gefühle. In Heidi Happys zauberhaften Welten fühlt man sich zuhause und wird von den Stimmungen überwältigt. Das Herzenserlebnis erinnert an den Meister Ennio Morricone, Joni Mitchell oder an den Sound von Frank Sinatra.</p> <p>Das berührende Werk entstand in der Abgeschiedenheit am Ufer des Bodensees und erhielt in Los Angeles den letzten Schliff. Wie bereits bei ihren ersten beiden Alben schrieb, komponierte und arrangierte Heidi Happy alle Songs selbst. Musikalisch klettert sie dabei eine Stufe weiter. Band und klassische Instrumente setzt sie gleichberechtigt, unkonventionell und voller sanfter Effekte ein. Die Arrangements sind dabei so fein und liebevoll, dass Heidi Happys Sound intim bleibt.</p> <p>Durch diesen kunstvoll gewobenen, federleichten Klangstoff strahlt Heidi Happys Stimme in ihrer ganzen Vielfalt. Melancholie war nie so zärtlich, tröstlich, frech. Es ist Musik, um zuhause in verflossener Liebe zu schwelgen. Ihren grossartigen Bandmusikern ist Heidi übrigens treu geblieben. Gemischt wurde «Hiding With The Wolves» vom Ton-Ingenieur Andrew Scheps (Johnny Cash, My Brightest Diamond), das Mastering besorgte Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson).</p> <p>Bereits Heidi Happys zweites Album erschien in Europa, Japan und Kanada. Seit 2009 spielte sie rund um die Welt und sang unter anderem mit Yello, Coal, Stephan Eicher, D-Sisive, Monotales, The Sad Riders, Handsome Hank und Zwicker. Jetzt erobert Heidi Happy furchtlos weitere Sphären und beschert ihrem Publikum damit fabelhafte Momente von grenzenlosem Glück.</p> <p><span class=""caps"">PRESS</span> <span class=""caps"">RELEASE</span> <span class=""caps"">FRENCH</span></p> <p><span class=""caps"">HEIDI</span> <span class=""caps"">HAPPY</span>, Hiding With The Wolves</p> <p>La plupart des gens se contenteraient de la carrière que Heidi Happy s’est forgée. Deux albums, un succès grandissant non seulement en Suisse mais aussi au Japon, aux <span class=""caps"">USA</span>, au Canada et en Europe, une identité forte faite de morceaux pop aux ludiques arrangements de cordes, une personnalité gaie et fraîche, la machine était en marche. Mais Heidi Happy, Dieu merci, n’est pas comme la plupart des gens.</p> <p>Toujours à la recherche d’un nouveau challenge qui pourrait mettre à profit son amour et sa science des arrangements classiques, son sens inné de la mélodie et son songwriting délicat, elle s’est attelée à la confection d’un album de pop orchestrée ambitieux et sincère. Terrée dans une maison côtière sise sur les bords du lac de Constance, elle s’est libérée d’un trop plein d’émotions jusqu’alors retenues. Visitée par les vents froids du soir, par les curieux animaux de l’hiver puis par ceux que le printemps avait éveillés, elle a laissé remonter de vieilles histoires qu’elle croyait à tout jamais enfouies. Jour après jour, elle a joint ses mots simples et personnels aux sonorités fascinantes d’un orchestre symphonique, illuminant le tout de sa sensibilité folk florissante. A l’instar d’un Ennio Morricone ou d’un Frank Sinatra, la féminité et la juvénilité en plus, elle a écrit, composé et arrangé un album tout empreint de pureté, d’innocence sensuelle, de délassement sophistiqué.</p> <p>Aux côtés de cette voix bouleversante et de ces chansons envoutantes, ce qui rend cet album particulièrement fascinant se trouve dans l’utilisation tout en légèreté de l’orchestre symphonique. Alors que tant d’artistes pop tombent dans le piège de la facilité, dans les pompeux arrangements à la Walt Disney, Heidi Happy place ses instruments classiques en finesse. Un subtil accompagnement de cordes veloutées, de cuivres élégants qui complètent délicatement la voix sans jamais prendre le pas sur le groupe. Que cette jeune femme ait su diriger tant de musiciens pour créer un oeuvre si intime est sans doute son plus prodigieux accomplissement.</p> <p>D’une maison au bord du lac de Constance au studio de mastering de Bernie Grundman (Joni Mitchell, Willie Nelson) en passant par la gigantesque salle d’enregistrement d’un studio classique et par la table de mixage d’Andrew Scheps (réputé pour son travail avec Johnny Cash ou My Brightest Diamond), Heidi Happy est restée fidèle à la pureté de sa vision. Ses chansons d’amours perdues, de ports abandonnés et de chevaux errants sont aussi précieuses, innocentes et naturelles que leur interprète. Un album apaisant, réconfortant qui vous hantera longtemps.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/5469739/91dad988a877bf0b217e54f2eeee0e0f_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/k8rrToMiXm8?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

Their self-titled debut album (2009) shares similarities with their new material (release date TBA). However, the unmistakable improvement in songwriting, vocals, and musicianship in general, brings with it a somewhat more refined, and intense flavor. Brutal screams, crushing power-grooves, and chainsaw guitar riffs are now accompanied by sharper, more dynamic transitions and multi-layered screaming & singing vocals.

Johnston sold some of his family’s farmland to finance the recording of his second album, Can You Fly (an event he wrote about in a song on that album, ""Trying to Tell You I Don’t Know""). Johnston followed up with his 1994 major label debut This Perfect World, which received rave reviews and led to Rolling Stone Magazine naming him ""songwriter of the year"". That album also spawned a minor alternative hit with the song ""Bad Reputation"". Johnston’s songs are often about troubled loners, and cover topics like heartbreak, alienation and disappointment. Known for the craftsmanship of his songs, he has sometimes been called a ""songwriter’s songwriter"". He has contributed songs to the soundtracks for movies including Kingpin and Things to Do in Denver When You’re Dead. Johnston and fellow musicians Jay Moran, James ""Pie"" Cowan, Duke Erikson, and Butch Vig perform occasional shows as a covers band called ""The Know-It-All Boyfriends.""

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/guards","Guards","New York, NY","indie, indie pop, lo-fi","After leading the Willowz for eight years, Richie Follin needed a break. Not from playing music, but from everything that goes along with running a band. He had started playing in his sister Madeline’s project Cults, and having less on his plate felt great at first. “Cults wasn’t really my band, I was just the guitar player and there to support my little sister and friends. So that was a great release, just to have time away from having to be focused on running everything.” But after a while he couldn’t help himself. Follin and Loren Humphrey, who drummed in both Willowz and Cults, demoed some songs for possible inclusion on the next Cults record. He was “gonna wait and see if they want to use them first, but the process of them making an album was a year and a half. It was a long, long thing. So I was sitting on them and ended up singing on them.” Happy with the results, Follin posted his collaborations with Madeline and Chairlift singer Caroline Polachek. “They both Tweeted about it after I put up the page, so it was all over the internet. It just started building, but I didn’t have a band. It was me who played everything on it, recorded it, produced it, and so we started getting offers to play shows and people were calling and labels and all that stuff just from the internet. So we got asked to play a show at CMJ. That was the first show I put a band together for.” Direct and punchy but sprinkled with hints of folky British psychedelia and California sunshine, Follin knew the songs he and Humphrey made were different than anything he had done before. Their friend Kaylie Church joined in, and the trio got to work on making their first album as Guards. “I had never stopped recording music the entire time since that EP came out, so we had four albums worth of songs and it really just came down to picking the best songs and it happened to be the most current songs that we ended up with.” Follin pulled from the shimmer and shine of ‘70’s power pop groups, the big guitar choruses of Grunge, some psych rock, the straight ahead drive of ‘60’s rock and soul, and a little bit of early ‘80’s New Wave while making In Guards We Trust, but he and mixer Shane Stoneback were intent on making certain the album sounded like more than the sum of its influences. “If you treat a song a certain way, no matter how modern the style of song, it could sound like it’s from 1968,” he says. “I want to have that feeling there, but I want it to sound modern and of its time. So if you go back 30 years you’ll know that’s from 2013.” Making it sound of its time took some time. Follin spent months finding the right approach for In Guards We Trust, a process that saw him rethink all the tricks he had grown to rely on. “The way I was writing stuff kind of changed. I was writing less on the guitar and some of the songs were just built around a drum loop,” he says, “Some were written on the piano and I’m not really a piano player. And some of them were just built around the atmosphere of this guitar pedal effect, which I had never really done that way before.” Recording was then delayed when he accidentally broke his jaw, but things finally snapped in to place when he unintentionally wrote the album’s single “Ready To Go.” “I was pretty much thinking the album was done. I started playing this song, just started messing around, doing random chord changes, sitting in my room, pretending I was playing this gigantic festival to a sea of people in the summer, and it just slowly kind of developed from that,” he says. “I started rewriting it and it guided the rest of the album, I think. “The verse is just about when Kaylie and I first met. We were in San Francisco and those hills are super steep and we had my van full of people but everyone was afraid to pull my car out of the parking space, and Kaylie did it, so I kind of drew from that. The chorus was about being ‘up and ready to go’ in more ways than one which is something I think a lot of people can relate to.” -Michael Tedder","<p>After leading the Willowz for eight years, Richie Follin needed a break.

Pronounced “alt-J”, the delta sign is created when you hold down the alt key on your computer keyboard and punch ‘J’ on a Mac computer. The symbol has a deeper meaning for the band, as guitarist/bassist Gwil Sainsbury notes, “in mathematical equations it’s used to show change,” and the band’s relatively new name came at a turning point in their lives. Gwil, Joe Newman [guitar/vocals], Gus Unger-Hamilton [keyboards] and Thom Green [drums] met at Leeds University in 2007. Gus studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art. In their second year of studies, Joe played Gwil a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Gwil acting as producer on Garageband. Needless to say, the response to Joe’s hushed falsetto yelps and Gwil’s rudimentary sampling skills was good. When Thom was played the tracks he joined the band straight away. “I hadn’t heard anything like it,” he says. “It was music I was looking for, I just didn’t know I was. I just loved it.” Gus completed the band’s lineup and together – first as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as Films – the four friends spent the next two years playing around town, developing a precise and unique brand of alt. pop that draws on poignant folk verses, crushing synths, smart hip hop syncopations and tight vocal harmonies. They dropped the moniker of Films in 2007, largely to avoid confusing the band with Californian punk troupe The Films. alt-J gave them a unique name to go with the unique ‘folk-step’ that they now concoct in the basement of a terrace house in Cambridgeshire. Admiration and favourable comparisons have come thick and fast for alt-J. Before the release of their instantly sold out debut single on Loud And Quiet last October, the band were described as “Nick Drake meets Gangsta Rap,” and they were likened to Wild Beasts, ‘In Rainbows’ era Radiohead, The xx and Anthony & The Johnsons – acts acclaimed for their ability to create the kind of patient, sophisticated, intricate music that alt-J do. An early demo of the skittish, euphoric ‘Breezeblocks’ gained healthy radio play without even being released and alt-J’s Soundcloud generated over 70,000 plays in its first 6 months with little to no promotion. From Joe’s high soul cry and Thom’s refusal to drum with cymbals (he started with saucepans because he couldn’t fit a full drum kit in Gwil’s bedroom where the band first practiced), to the sparse guitars and Gus’ delicate key clunks on songs like ‘Bloodflood’, a neat sound-bite for alt-j’s music is yet to be coined, and perhaps never will be. And by challenging what constitutes folk, hip hop, indie and pop music, the band have quickly found themselves in the studio at the beginning of 2012, recording their debut album for Infectious Music with long-time producer Charlie Andrew (Micachu & The Shapes, Eugene McGuinness). Veering wildly from psychedelic avant pop to skeletal folktronica, the finished album promises to trade in understated beauty one minute and epic oddities the next, just as you’d expect from a debut album that tackles everything from love to bullfighting to the heroic life of 1930s war photographer Gerda Taro, crushed by a tank on the frontline. Other tracks are inspired by cinema, including ‘Matilda’ (about Natalie Portman’s character in Luc Besson’s Leon) and the Good The Bad And The Ugly-referencing ‘Tessellate’.","<p>alt-J’s name takes a little explaining.

The funky psych-pop of 2011’s Underneath the Pine evinced an artist who could create similar atmospheres even without the aid of source material and drum machines. His Freaking Out EP, a handful of singles and remixes, and a retrospective box-set plot points all along the producer-songwriter spectrum in which he’s worked since his debut, and his third full-length, Anything In Return, sees him poised directly in the middle of the two. The product of a move to Berkeley, CA and the subsequent extended separation from loved ones, Anything in Return shows a pervasive sense of peace with Bundick’s tendency to dabble in both sides of the modern music-making spectrum, and he sounds comfortable engaging in intuitive pop production, putting forth the impression of unmediated id. The producer’s hand is prominent—not least in the sampled “yeah”s and “uh”s that give the album a hip-hop-indebted confidence— and many of the songs feature the 4/4 beats and deftly employed effects usually associated with house music. Tracks like “High Living” and “Day One” show a considerably Californian influence, their languid funk redolent of a decidedly West Coast temperament, and elsewhere—not least on lead single, “So Many Details”— the record plays with darker atmospheres than we’re used to hearing from Toro Y Moi. Sounding quite assured in what some may call this songwriter’s return to producer-hood, Anything in Return is Bundick uninhibited by issues of genre, an album that feels like the artist’s essence.","<p>Since his first offerings began making the Internet rounds in 2009, Toro Y Moi’s Chaz Bundick has proven himself to be not just a prolific musician, but a diverse one as well, letting each successive release broaden the scope of the his oeuvre.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/icona-pop","Icona Pop","Välj region., Sv","electronica, electronic, swedish, electropop","Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt met on a Saturday night in February 2009. It was, Aino says quite reasonably, “the best thing that ever happened”. So the day after the best thing that ever happened happened, these two girls from the Stockholm suburbs formed a electronic pop duo band, and on the Monday – when the hangovers had cleared and it still all seemed like the best thing that had ever happened – they booked their first gig – Icona Pop was born. This felt all very well, but then they realised they had four weeks until their gig, but no songs. Autumn of 2011, Icona Pop moved from Stockholm to London, and with an album ready to go the tunes are in no short supply. Icona Pop says: “We like galloping drums, and synthesisers, but we still like the classical pop melodies. And that’s ‘what we are’. We don’t have to decide, because there’s no decision to be made. We just have to do exactly what we want.” In the intervening years they’ve working with The Knocks (voted one of NME’s hottest production outfits of the hour), Patrik Berger (Robyn), Elof Loelv (Niki & The Dove), Fredrik Berger (The Good Natured) and Style of Eye, as well as sessions with UK producers like Starsmith (Kylie, Ellie Goulding) and Burns. Their Neon Gold-released double a-side single ‘Manners’ / ‘Top Rated’ prompted journals like NME and The Guardian say things along the lines of “effortlessly cool” and “all the makings of a 24-carat pop hit”, and the duo have perfected their live show, too – that first performance back in 2009 went rather well, all things considered, while their first London gig was impressive enough to bag them a management deal with Artist Company TEN, the team behind Niki & The Dove and Erik Hassle. There’s plenty more of this evocative stuff right across Icona Pop’s as-yet-untitled debut album, due out in 2012. Effervescently romantic number ‘Sun Goes Down’ is a Knocks collaboration written on a trip to New York. “We both had a crush at home,” Caroline recalls, “and we were thinking about our lovely men on the other side of the ocean, singing, ‘I will be waiting for you until the sun goes down’.” The sound of it all is hard to pinpoint, but there are some unmistakeable Madonnaisms on spirited anthem ‘Beat The L’. So that original plan for Caroline to give Aino her best night ever? Well, that night they met in 2009 has since been immortalised in song, on the vivid and joyous ‘Nights Like This’ Caroline explains, “everything that night was like magic, and the lyric ‘nights like this, you will never be alone’, is what Icona Pop is all about. It’s about being together and having fun, and inviting as many people as possible because the best nights out are the ones you want to share with everyone.” As nights out go, Icona Pop’s first must of one of pop’s most vital, and it’s still in full effect three years later. In fact, it feels like it’s just getting going. “We’re having so much fun all the time,” Aino smiles. “It’s kind of scary.”","<p>Aino Jawo and Caroline Hjelt met on a Saturday night in February 2009. It was, Aino says quite reasonably, “the best thing that ever happened”.</p> <p>So the day after the best thing that ever happened happened, these two girls from the Stockholm suburbs formed a electronic pop duo band, and on the Monday – when the hangovers had cleared and it still all seemed like the best thing that had ever happened – they booked their first gig – Icona Pop was born. This felt all very well, but then they realised they had four weeks until their gig, but no songs.</p> <p>Autumn of 2011, Icona Pop moved from Stockholm to London, and with an album ready to go the tunes are in no short supply. Icona Pop says: “We like galloping drums, and synthesisers, but we still like the classical pop melodies. And that’s ‘what we are’. We don’t have to decide, because there’s no decision to be made. We just have to do exactly what we want.”</p> <p>In the intervening years they’ve working with The Knocks (voted one of <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">NME</span></span>’s hottest production outfits of the hour), Patrik Berger (Robyn), Elof Loelv (Niki & The Dove), Fredrik Berger (The Good Natured) and Style of Eye, as well as sessions with UK producers like Starsmith (Kylie, Ellie Goulding) and Burns.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/ra-ra-riot","Ra Ra Riot","Syracuse, NY","indie, indie rock, indie pop","Ra Ra Riot first met seven years ago while attending school in Syracuse, New York, and quickly graduated from basement rehearsals and student dance parties to blog buzz and press acclaim for their debut The Rhumb Line. After extensive touring for their meticulously recorded second record The Orchard and some membership changes, Ra Ra Riot decided to mix things up for their album Beta Love, leaving upstate New York for Sweet Tea, the Oxford, MS studio of producer Dennis Herring (Modest Mouse/Elvis Costello/Wavves). Herring pushed singer Wes Miles, guitarist Milo Bonacci, bassist Mathieu Santos and violinist Rebecca Zeller to embrace spontaneity and rethink their roles. The band recreated themselves on Beta Love, a collection of giddy pop songs and heady lyrics that pull inspiration from futurist Ray Kurzweil, among others. Gathered in their manager’s Williamsburg apartment, the band took a few moments to talk So the first thing I noticed listening to the album is that the longest song is three minutes and sixteen seconds. Was there a concentrated effort to get things as concise as possible this time around? Wes Miles: I think it was slightly a reaction from our last record. But I think it was secondary to the overall goal that the process should serve the song, rather than having long jams and stuff to showcase our musicianship. It’s more about the songs. Did you make a conscious effort to approach the songwriting differently? WM: With this record, I wanted to work with Dennis on pre-production to really find out what the songs were going to be, and from there do nothing that wouldn’t serve the songs. Sometimes we get handcuffed by “bring the demo to the band, then try to play it and then that’ll be the song.” Rebecca Zeller: Also we wanted for everyone to not go in knowing exactly what we’d be doing, like “I’m going to play violin on this one,” or “I’m playing bass.” It was a sense of putting away our…. Milo Bonacci: Egos RZ: Egos and pre-defined roles. It was amazing how quickly we were able to put that stuff aside and focus on the fun of making music without worrying about anything else. MB: The idea that “nothing is precious” really set the tone for all of us, how we felt about our contributions or whatever. Anything can change at any moment. I felt like we spent two albums incubating these little ideas we had and it got to the point where they would become so precious that nothing was excludable, but in a weird way we had also limited the sonic spaces we were operating in for those albums. And for this album you guys were down to a four-piece. How did that affect the way you wrote songs and approached the recording process? WM: Well, the four of us are pretty different to begin with and once everyone was able to buy into this idea of “you’re gonna have to just roll with the punches,” I think it helped everyone look past “oh, where is my role?” You sort of just figure it out. RZ: On both The Rhumb Line and The Orchard we all sat down and we jammed through these songs, and it wasn’t a question of “does this song need strings?” It was “what is the string part going to be for this?” And so approaching these songs it was really thinking, as Wes said, “what does this song need? What serves this song the best?” I was so excited for the “Dance With Me” string part, which is just two notes. Doing something so simple seemed fun and effective. MS: Becca would be working with string parts and she’d send demos to all of us and it felt more of a collaborative discussion where we’re all on the same page all the time, where in the past it seemed like the string department was… MB: Departmentalized. MS: Yeah. And we didn’t really allow ourselves to really reach out across to each other. How much of this album is you guys reacting to your previous worries of preciousness? Were you consciously trying to react against whatever images people may have of you or you may have had of yourself? RZ: Back in Syracuse, in the early days, our roots were that we’d play these dance parties and everybody would be dancing and I guess we sort of strayed from that with The Orchard. MB: We started thinking too much about it. But in some ways I feel this record is more similar to how we approached things when we first started. Using our gut reaction to things and more immediate sort of decisionmaking. WM: We always liked making music that moves people physically So, Wes, you went out and worked with Dennis on demos first for a little while before the rest of the band came out. Tell me a little more about that process. WM: I didn’t know what to expect going down there at first, but he told me to “bring an open mind and a positive attitude” and my little Casio keyboard. We had sent him a few early, early demos. I didn’t know which ones we’d be working on. So I got there and he basically just set me up in their little edit suite at Sweet Tea Studios. We went down the list and were like “which ones would be fun to work on this week?” We would work for a few hours together and then he’d leave me in there to shape things on my own and sing things or improvise or cut things up and then he’d come back the next morning. He’d go on the computer and cut things up or tell me which things he really liked and where things could be thrown away. It was really active editing and recording and we ended up basically completing a demo every day that I was there. For the songwriting process, there’s a lot of letting go of control and trying to be in the moment and not have firm ideas of what’s going on. Lyrically, did that kind of transfer over? WM: Yeah, yeah it did. In the past I would have been afraid to write a lot of the lyrics that I wrote on this record, because a lot of them are sort of specific and weird about science fiction or inspired by specific people. The attitude in general was to let go and to not worry so much and so basically if I thought something was interesting I’d just sort of go for it, whereas in the past it’s “is this a good thing to write a song about?” And usually I would compromise it to a degree, but I felt liberated by Dennis’ encouragement and the band’s encouragement to just go for whatever. So it was a lot of work, but it was a lot of fun, too. Looking back I’m very proud of the lyrics on this album. Tell me about “Binary Mind.” That definitely seems to have a lot of science fiction-as-emotional conflict metaphor in it. WM: Well, that song is about Ray Kurzweil. We got into him at the end of The Orchard. I majored in physics in college and I’ve always been interested in science-type things, so that was a very easy thing for me to get into and Mat was also really into that. MS: I ordered The Singularity Is Near. WM: It’s all about his mathematical extrapolations of estimating when humans and computers will merge and be indistinguishable. And there’s also a great documentary about him, sort of exploring that idea. MB: Transcendent Man. WM: Yeah, Transcendent Man. So we got really into him and his ideas. Watching the movie, you realize one of his biggest hopes for singularity is to sort of recreate his father. He has these boxes and boxes of his father’s legal and financial documents and personal writings and all these things he thinks are going to help create sort of an avatar of his dad when singularity happens. And meanwhile he’s racing against time in his own way, because according to his theory, singularity happens at a certain time and he’s battling human deterioration. So that’s basically what the song’s about, from his perspective, hoping when singularity happens, he’ll be able to sync with his computer and create his father, bring his father back to life, basically. I thought that was a really amazing, crazy, real life story. In a way, that seems the exact opposite of your mindset where you guys are trying to give up control, he’s trying to have control over death. Reminds me of “Dying Is Fine,” from your first album… So Beta Love is an interesting phrase – there’s the idea of beta as an in progress software program, not quite ready to go. There’s also the idea of a beta male, someone who’s less aggressive and more thoughtful than an alpha male. Was that a combination you’d go for in the lyrics? WM: To be perfectly honest, I hadn’t thought of the second meaning that you brought up. The lyrics for that song were finished pretty late. It was just a really exciting moment because it encapsulates a lot of other topics on the record. It’s supposed to be about this beta version of an android discovering love. But listening to it and writing the rest of the lyrics, it felt like it was really representative of everything. “Angel, Please” is probably the most danceable song on the record. How did it come about? WM: That was sort of a contentious one in the studio, because we weren’t really sure how to go about it. It was much slower in demo and had this meandering melody that of course Dennis wasted no time getting us to trim down. MS: Dennis called us all into the control room and he played us OutKast’s “Hey Ya!” and then he was like… WM: “Let’s just all go super happy, super positive.” Is that a change of pace for you? Being positive and happy? WM: No, but it was challenging us to be even more happy and positive. MB: Just like, really go for it. WM: Just don’t hold back. -Michael Tedder","<p>Ra Ra Riot first met seven years ago while attending school in Syracuse, New York, and quickly graduated from basement rehearsals and student dance parties to blog buzz and press acclaim for their debut The Rhumb Line.

I majored in physics in college and I’ve always been interested in science-type things, so that was a very easy thing for me to get into and Mat was also really into that.</p> <p>MS: I ordered The Singularity Is Near.</p> <p>WM: It’s all about his mathematical extrapolations of estimating when humans and computers will merge and be indistinguishable. And there’s also a great documentary about him, sort of exploring that idea.</p> <p>MB: Transcendent Man.</p> <p>WM: Yeah, Transcendent Man. So we got really into him and his ideas. Watching the movie, you realize one of his biggest hopes for singularity is to sort of recreate his father. He has these boxes and boxes of his father’s legal and financial documents and personal writings and all these things he thinks are going to help create sort of an avatar of his dad when singularity happens. And meanwhile he’s racing against time in his own way, because according to<br /> his theory, singularity happens at a certain time and he’s battling human deterioration. So that’s basically what the song’s about, from his perspective, hoping when singularity happens, he’ll be able to sync with his computer and create his father, bring his father back to life, basically. I thought that was a really amazing, crazy, real life story.</p> <p>In a way, that seems the exact opposite of your mindset where you guys are trying to give up control, he’s trying to have control over death. Reminds me of “Dying Is Fine,” from your first album…</p> <p>So Beta Love is an interesting phrase – there’s the idea of beta as an in progress software program, not quite ready to go. There’s also the idea of a beta male, someone who’s less aggressive and more thoughtful than an alpha male. Was that a combination you’d go for in the lyrics?</p> <p>WM: To be perfectly honest, I hadn’t thought of the second meaning that you brought up. The lyrics for that song were finished pretty late. It was just a really exciting moment because it encapsulates a lot of other topics on the record. It’s supposed to be about this beta version of an android discovering love. But listening to it and writing the rest of the lyrics, it felt like it was really representative of everything.</p> <p>“Angel, Please” is probably the most danceable song on the record. How did it come about?</p> <p>WM: That was sort of a contentious one in the studio, because we weren’t really sure how to go about it. It was much slower in demo and had this meandering melody that of course Dennis wasted no time getting us to trim down.</p> <p>MS: Dennis called us all into the control room and he played us OutKast’s “Hey Ya!” and then he was like…</p> <p>WM: “Let’s just all go super happy, super positive.”</p> <p>Is that a change of pace for you? Being positive and happy?</p> <p>WM: No, but it was challenging us to be even more happy and positive.</p> <p>MB: Just like, really go for it.</p> <p>WM: Just don’t hold back.</p> <p>-Michael Tedder</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7612014/a2c8eb681c654c0e11da00684027c34c_poster.png","http://www.youtube.com/e/D9GNLOUlMGg?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

A genuine lyricist and a captivating performer, Macklemore, with his DJ/production partner Ryan Lewis, have garnered critical acclaim, a devoted fan base, and a steadily growing anticipation for their upcoming work.Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ music is distinct for channeling cultural moments and refreshingly self-aware testimony through candid lyricism and expertly crafted composition. Their work has impressed and enthused a multitude of listeners, nowhere more evident than in the populist barometer of the internet, where some of Macklemore’s songs, videos and even fan-uploaded media have over one million listens and views. The recent single “Wings” is an anthemic meditation on being of the Air Jordan generation with a lucid perspective on an otherwise trodden motif. “Otherside” offers a darkly searing portrait of his own story of addiction and the hype of substance within hip-hop culture. Crowd-favorite songs like “And We Danced” and “Irish Celebration” demonstrate Macklemore’s ability to get raucous with disarming candor and relentlessly energetic showmanship.On their first national headlining tour in the spring of 2011, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis packed houses and sold out a majority of their shows, including those in New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and a three-night run at Seattle’s Showbox at the Market, where over 3,500 tickets sold out in less than 48 hours.Macklemore’s freshman release in 2005, Language of My World, featured production by Rhymesayer’s Budo and was well-received by circles who noted Macklemore’s fresh perspective and a striking balance of insight and levity. After several subsequent years of artistic stagnation and frustration due to substance abuse, Macklemore made a commitment to sobriety with a newfound, more intrinsic dedication to his music. The catalyst to this change was establishing a partnership and ongoing collaboration with Ryan Lewis, an accomplished, consummate artist in design, photography, and production, who also acts as Macklemore’s touring DJ. They released the VS EP in 2009 & VS Redux in 2010, the latter reaching #7 on the iTunes Hip Hop charts.The pair has been featured at a significant number of major festivals and showcases, including the 2011 Rock The Bells Tour, Soundset (MN), MusicFest NW (OR), Bumbershoot (Seattle), Sasquatch (WA), Outside Lands (San Francisco), and a much-talked about run at SXSW, including a set at the Fader Fort. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis also performed their tribute song “My Oh My” at the Seattle Mariners home opener on April 8, 2011, at Safeco Field for over 40,000 attendees. Publication appearances of note include a “Show-And-Prove” feature in XXL Magazine, front-page feature on the Seattle Times and the cover of City Arts Magazine.Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are now hard at work on their first full-length album as well as a 7” that will feature two new songs later on this year. For all the thresholds that they’ve crossed—always bolstered by the loyalty and love of listeners and fans—the momentum that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis have generated makes their breakthrough to new heights imminent.#sharkfacegangvia Facebook","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">Macklemore holds a singular place in both the Pacific Northwest and now across the country as he emerges as a premier national hip-hop artist with numerous career highlights to his name.

Drawing their inspiration from art and philosophy, Fear of Men deliberately juxtaposes iconic museum imagery and lyrical themes of loneliness and fragmentation with buoyant pop melodies.While studying for a Fine Art & History of Art degree, Jessica Weiss (vocals + guitar) was exhibiting some of her home recordings of ambient soundtracks to short films when these recordings caught the attention of Daniel Falvey (guitar). The two began swapping mix tapes and started a friendship based on a shared love of melody and an eclectic mix of artists such as The Chills, Grouper, Neutral Milk Hotel, The Magnetic Fields, and The Byrds, ultimately leading to the start of a more pop-focused project which they called Fear of Men.Starting out, the duo recorded their music on a 4-track and transferred it onto their laptops, which Jess would then use as part of her degree work. They uploaded their songs to bandcamp and immediately caught the attention of UK blogs. Enlisting the help of friends to play drums and bass, Fear of Men approached DIY promoters and immediately began playing live shows.Fear of Men, completed by Michael Miles (drums) and Robyn Edwards (bass), began releasing singles on DIY and independent UK labels and capturing the attention of Pitchfork, NME, Gorilla vs. Bear, Stereogum, The Fader, Drowned in Sound and topping the Hype Machine charts. For a wider introduction into North America, Fear of Men is releasing “Early Fragments” a reverse chronological collection of their previous single releases, many of which were only available in Europe on limited edition 7” and cassette pressings.Fans of Broadcast and Julie Doiron will instantly gravitate toward Jess’ tender vocals and melodies. The songs are beguilingly sweet while the lyrics are often bleakly nihilistic, meaning that you’ll find yourself singing along to these intelligent, well-crafted pop songs while unwittingly sinking deeper into Fear of Men’s world.Press Quotes“Fear of Men’s swoony, sweet dream-pop is both euphoric and miserable, all at once” - Stereogum“A dreamy four-piece band split between London and Brighton” -Pitchfork“Fear of Men are truly one of the most consistent groups on the rise- every new song is like a dive into a leaf pile, and the heaps are piling up impossible to ignore” - The Fader“One of the best new bands of 2012” - Gorilla vs. Bear“At just the slightest of guitar riffs or harmonic woos, the Brighton-sometimes-London fourpiece can evoke the sort of spine tingle that most bands could only bring about after layers and layers of ear-numbing reverb.” - The Line of Best Fit","<p class=""wysiwyg-text-align-justify""><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">Fear of Men, born of an art school project, has turned into one of the most promising bands of 2013.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/blessed-feathers","Blessed Feathers","West Bend, WI","indie, singer-songwriter, folk, acoustic","West Bend is a Southeast Wisconsin town where the Milwaukee River shifts directions, angling to suddenly head West. It’s also the home of Blessed Feathers, a duo that initiated when Donivan Berube’s life similarly altered course. Hailing from Lakeland Florida, FL, Berube was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, teaching himself guitar and recorded songs in his bedroom in an attempt to pursue his passion. The musician eventually left home at 17, disassociating himself from the church and driving 36 hours from the Florida sunshine into a Wisconsin blizzard. Berube found work in a restaurant in West Bend where he met Jacquelyn Beaupre, who is now his partner in both music and life. Blessed Feathers arose from Beaupre’s solo material, which Berube produced while living on a farm in Farmington, WI in 2009. Originally he was only interested in augmenting her songwriting, bolstering the organic, folk-inspired track with additional instrumentation and vocal harmonies, but slowly the duo began constructing songs together, each bringing their own stylistic tendencies to the table. “We didn’t really have a plan set in our minds,” Berube says of the music. “It’s just what happened.” The pair played their first show at a West Bend bookstore in April of 2010 at a meeting of the Fireside Books’ Poetry Club, building a reputation in the surrounding towns. Their stock of songs grew, all captured via a laptop and microphone in their bedroom. In mid-2012, however, Blessed Feathers selected their favorite five tracks to record with producer Kevin McMahon (Real Estate, Titus Andronicus, The Walkmen) at his studio in New Paltz, NY. The songs, which comprise the band’s debut EP, Peaceful Beasts in an Ocean of Weeds, encapsulate Berube and Beaupre’s collective experiences, aiming to capture both their emotional and geographic journeys. “I feel like these songs were birthed in Wisconsin so what we’re recording is how we feel about our home and focused on imagery from our home,” Beaupre says. “Donivan has a few songs from Florida, from before he came up to Wisconsin. But most of the songs are little bits and pieces of our life in Wisconsin. They’re all rooted in locale, all about places we’ve lived. We’re trying to pick out small pieces of our own history and enlighten people with that.” Berube adds, “This EP compiles our five best songs to date. We wanted to put our best foot forward, so to speak.” The pair contributed numerous instruments to the album, including banjo, flute, vibraphone and various percussion. But, ultimately, McMahon and the band focused on maintain the earthy, homespun sound that Blessed Feathers has cultivated over the past few years. The EP resonates with a woodsy vibe, urging the listener into an intimate, skillfully crafted sonic space—aided in many ways by McMahon’s recording style. “He has little tricks up his sleeve,” Beaupre notes. “Because we recorded it in a barn he took our vocals and recorded them through a microphone and then played them into the silo of the barn and record the natural echoes. That became the album recording. It’s a wonderful sound and we loved that idea. Things like that have helped shape the EP.” Berube and Beaupre still work in the same restaurant where they first met, spending their time, as Berube says, “cooking dinner for strangers.” They share a 10-year-old cell phone and can only access the Internet from their local library. They are interested in capturing all their experiences, not just the ones they’ve found in West Bend. Their music is optimistic, gleaming with a sense of appreciation for the things around them and the things within them. The pair likes to say that Beaupre plays everything and Berube plays everything else, but a better way to put it is that together they play everything.","<p>West Bend is a Southeast Wisconsin town where the Milwaukee River shifts directions, angling to suddenly head West.

Taking a no-holds-barred attitude to music creation Flume takes inspiration from a wide variety of sources and scenes distilling his sound into a melodic bass heavy style of his own. International press has come from tastemaking sources including XLR8R (USA – 8.6/10 review), Lodown Magazine (UK – 8/10 review) & Electronic Beats (Germany). In Australia, Flume has received strong support from leading youth broadcaster Triple J (morning Host Zan Rowe naming ‘Sleepless’ as her “Catch of The Day”) and community radio nationally, with high rotation on RRR, PBS, RTR, FBi and 2ser. Flume is getting significant buzz online with ‘Sleepless’ amassing 500,000+ plays on YouTube, and 120,000+ on Soundcloud and his facebook page has 23,000+ fans in less than a year of being online. Sleepless was soft released in August 2011 and has been #1 on the iTunes Australia Electronic Chart for several weeks and in the top 10 for several months. Flume has also featured on a vinyl co-release with Anna Lunoe and has released remixes for Hermitude, Junior Boys, Onra, The Aston Shuffle and Ta-ku. Flume’s live shows have now come into full effect after 2 sold out national headline tours of 300-500 capacity rooms, Sydney and Melbourne supports for the xx and Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (forthcoming) and festival bookings for Splendour in the Grass, a sold-out show at Vivid LIVE at the Sydney Opera House where he headlined alongside Jacques Renault & Isolee, and has been confirmed for the full national run for Parklife, as well as Harbourlife, Foreshore and several more New Years period festivals in Australia and New Zealand. He’s also been the main support for shows by Hermitude, Oscar + Martin, Chet Faker and New Navy. Internationally Flume has been confirmed to perform at CMJ in New York in October 2012 and been signed for UK and European booking by Elastic Artists (Flying Lotus, Major Lazer) with plans for both a European and North American tour in 2013. Flume’s debut self-titled album will be out on 12 November 2012 released worldwide by Future Classic (Flight Facilities, New Navy). It will be preceded by a vinyl/digital release of Sleepless on 24 September with remixes by Shlohmo (USA) and Midland (UK) and a video clip.

In Australia, Flume has received strong support from leading youth broadcaster Triple J (morning Host Zan Rowe naming ‘Sleepless’ as her “Catch of The Day”) and community radio nationally, with high rotation on <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">RRR</span></span>, <span class=""caps"">PBS</span>, <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">RTR</span></span>, FBi and 2ser.</p> <p>Flume is getting significant buzz online with ‘Sleepless’ amassing 500,000+ plays on YouTube, and 120,000+ on Soundcloud and his facebook page has 23,000+ fans in less than a year of being online. Sleepless was soft released in August 2011 and has been #1 on the iTunes Australia Electronic Chart for several weeks and in the top 10 for several months. Flume has also featured on a vinyl co-release with Anna Lunoe and has released remixes for Hermitude, Junior Boys, Onra, The Aston Shuffle and Ta-ku.</p> <p>Flume’s live shows have now come into full effect after 2 sold out national headline tours of 300-500 capacity rooms, Sydney and Melbourne supports for the xx and Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (forthcoming) and festival bookings for Splendour in the Grass, a sold-out show at Vivid <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">LIVE</span></span> at the Sydney Opera House where he headlined alongside Jacques Renault & Isolee, and has been confirmed for the full national run for Parklife, as well as Harbourlife, Foreshore and several more New Years period festivals in Australia and New Zealand.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/no-ceremony","NO CEREMONY///","Manchester, UK","dj, electronica, electronic, chillwave, darkwave","NO CEREMONY/// are an electronic three-piece from Manchester, UK. Their idiosyncratic sound, typified by chiming pianos, distorted synths and pounding kick drums, deftly explores the musical space between euphoric warehouse rave and melancholic, emotive pop. Glitched, machine-like cries and haunted, pure harmonic vocals interplay & counterbalance one another, creating a fascinating tension and atmosphere within the tracks. Be it their music, or their artistic videos, striking artwork or direct website, all of which they create and control themselves, this juxtaposition of the inhuman and the soulful, of the aggressive and the beautiful, works to underpin everything NO CEREMONY/// do. Originating in August 2011, the band announced their arrival onto the musical landscape in style, with their widely-lauded track ‘HURTLOVE’ setting blogs alight within 24 hours of release. Since then, they have shown no intention of slowing down, and over the last year have released six tracks to their ever-growing fanbase, each available as a free digital download, and two 10” vinyls on their own label, NOC///. Alongside this, they have collaborated on original music with the likes of Joey Santiago (PIXIES), Mike Joyce (The Smiths) and Stay+, remixed numerous well known and up and coming artists including Alt-J, The Temper Trap and Patrick Wolf, and created mixtapes for legendary electronic music DJ Mary Anne Hobbs and popular French music site HORS D’OEVRES. From the outset, the trio chose to shun traditional methods of self-promotion, instead choosing to keep the personas behind the music away from the limelight. They still do not appear on social media sites, have had no press shots taken and no personal biography written. Rather than simply being obfuscating, this decision was a way for them to focus all their efforts on creating music without the distraction of social media publication or autobiographical self-promotion. As the band themselves comment – ‘It’s not about being secretive or mysterious and more of a reluctance to engage. We want to engage through our music – that’s where we put our message and emotion.’ Subsequently, they have received a vast amount of critical acclaim purely for their consistent output of innovative, forward-thinking electronica, both at home and abroad. Hailed as Zane Lowe’s (BBC Radio 1) Next Big Hype, and featuring as one of The Independent’s Most Blogged Artists, NO CEREMONY/// have received Hype Machine Top 10 rankings twice, including a prolonged stay in the number 1 position for most recent release ‘FEELSOLOW’. They have also been featured on Pitchfork, playlisted on XFM (UK), Amazing Radio (UK), NRK (Norway) and Flux FM (Germany), and have appeared twice as Lauren Laverne’s (BBC 6 Music) MPFree of the Day. Taking their music into the live arena has also proved fruitful. Since their first gig in May 2012; a sold out hometown show with Mercury Award Winning Alt-J; they have also shared stages with SBTRKT, Zola Jesus, Willy Moon, Peace and Niki & The Dove. Soon after their first performance, and before they had even had a chance to play their own headline show, they had been invited to both the BBC’s prestigious Maida Vale Studios and the XFM Evening Show studios to record two captivating live radio session performances. All of the shows they have played in the UK have sold out, and they have toured in France, Germany, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, at such high profile events as Pukkelpop, MIDI, Swn, Dockville and Reeperbahn Festivals. In a glowing review of their performance at MIDI festival this summer, iconic French publication Les Inrocks poetically described NO CEREMONY/// as “A Volcano under the Ice”. This succinctly summarizes both the intensity and self-control the band have been acclaimed for, and the torrid emotion that lurks just below, frequently seeping through the mechanical surface of their music. Above all, it marks the genesis of a band for who these notable plaudits are just the beginning. They have recently finished recording their debut album, which is to be released in the early part of 2013. Whilst the achievements of this formative year are undoubtedly impressive, their inventive music, expanding admirers, and the method by which they connect the two, look set to ensure the future is even more exciting for NO CEREMONY///.

With their whimsical tunes about astral phenomena and spider bites, Merry Prankster-style stage antics, and a frontman with a voice that evokes Neil Young on nitrous oxide, the Oklahoma City band managed to build a cult following that exploded into something bigger in the late Nineties and 2000s.Melodically, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titles—such as “Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus with Needles”, ""Free Radicals (A Hallucination of the Christmas Skeleton Pleading with a Suicide Bomber)"" and “Yeah, I Know It’s a Drag… But Wastin’ Pigs Is Still Radical”. They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne’s signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of the “50 Bands to See Before You Die”.The group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a hit in 1993 with “She Don’t Use Jelly”. Although it has been their only hit single in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999’s The Soft Bulletin (which was NME magazine’s Album of the Year) and 2002’s Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe than in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award in the “Best International Act” category. By 2007, the group garnered three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.On October 13, 2009 the group released their latest studio album, titled Embryonic. On December 22, 2009, the Flaming Lips released a remake of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side Of The Moon. In 2011, the band announced plans to release new songs in every month of the year, with the entire process filmed.","<p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; "" class=""wysiwyg-color-black"">The Flaming Lips are an American rock band, formed in Norman, Oklahoma in 1983.</span><br></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; ""><br></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; ""><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: 12px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal; ""><span class=""wysiwyg-color-black"">The weirder, jokier and more indulgent the Flaming Lips get, the more their fans seem to love them.

Yet it was to a forest just outside Casco that The Joy Formidable singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan and bassist Rhydian Dafydd retired at the start of 2012 to dream up their magnificent second album, Wolf’s Law, a record that teems with imagination, yearning and a Carpe Diem restlessness. “It was just the two of us in this isolated spot where we hardly saw anybody else all the time we were there,” says Ritzy. “It snowed every day and the surroundings and the solitude gave us a different level of intensity. “We had no phone signal, no wi-fi – it was fucking bliss! It is Stephen King country up there and we worried that we’d turn into The Shining and cave each other’s heads in. But it was very still, very beautiful – and in a strange way it reminded us of our home area of North Wales.” Wolf’s Law is a driven, hugely emotive record, an alluring and attitudinal follow-up to The Joy Formidable’s keenly received 2011 debut, The Big Roar. It’s an album that was recorded in very different circumstances to its predecessor, both geographically and emotionally. “We had a very difficult period in our personal lives making The Big Roar,” says Rhydian. “Ritzy’s parents were going through a very painful, long-drawn-out divorce and also we lost both close friends and family. We made it in very tight, enclosed studio spaces and it made it a very frustrated and aggressive record. “With Wolf’s Law, some of the difficult personal circumstances have been resolved, so while there is still aggression there, the record is a lot more harmonious and focussed. It helped that we were completely lost in nature in Maine because it is really an album about reconnecting – with yourself, with nature and with spirituality.” Such heavyweight and profound themes run through Wolf’s Law like a pulse. The album’s audacious reach and ambition is clear in the extraordinary film that The Joy Formidable commissioned for its title track: a breathtaking sequence of monochrome images of birth, death and the natural world. “That track (Wolf’s Law) was always meant as an art piece, we wanted to make a visual that introduced the mood of the record. It’s a song about encouragement, reawakening hope and knowing that time is precious,” says Ritzy. “It’s very aware of its own mortality and how fleeting a moment can be.” “It encapsulates the themes of the album,” agrees Rhydian. “It’s about how beautiful and cruel life can be and how it’s always moving, and also about seizing the moment, because life is short.” It’s evident that the stark serenity of snowbound Casco impacted on the marrow of Wolf’s Law. Themes of the raw beauty and majesty of nature are laced throughout the album. The buzzsaw, ragged yet beautifully melodic Cholla was inspired by the giant cacti of the Joshua Tree National Park, yet also details familial breakdowns; The Leopard and the Lung was written in honour of a doughty environmentalist campaigner. “It’s about a true hero – a Kenyan female activist, Wangari Maathai who fought against an entire corrupt establishment for nature and for women’s rights,” says Ritzy. “She was so fucking brave! Her name,Wangari, means leopard in Kukuru. She told Kenyan women to plant trees because she said that trees are the lungs of the earth.” Yet not all of the audacious, propulsive Wolf’s Law is about such extraneous matters. Although Ritzy and Rhydian have been a couple since before the making of The Big Roar, they have never previously referenced their relationship in song. On the taut Tendons, a shimmering rock reverie powered by the martial beat of Joy Formidable drummer Matt Thomas, they courageously affix their hearts firmly to their sleeves. “Rhydian and I were making music together before we became a couple, so we have never experienced our relationship outside of the bubble of this band,” muses Ritzy. “It can be a difficult dynamic to maintain and it sometimes makes me wonder – is our relationship based on the chaos of this band and our music, and if that were to change, where would it leave us?” “The tendons reference is because we’re so inextricably linked,” adds Rhydian. “This band and music join us so closely together; we’re soul mates, but could it destroy us as well?” Precarious relationships. Confessionals. Catharsis. The call of the wild. Life, birth, death and all points in-between. With such vast, profound and heartfelt themes, wrapped up in some of the most visceral and voluptuous art-rock-and-roll that has exploded since the halcyon days of the Pixies, it’s no surprise that a lot of people expect Wolf’s Law to be The Joy Formidable’s quantum-leap breakthrough album, a springboard to arena-filling status, this fiercely driven band’s tipping point into rock’s A-League. Are they ready for this? Is it even what they want? “If we can keep our artistic integrity,” says Ritzy, “and carry on writing songs that are important to us, and keep the thrill and the excitement of doing what we do, and carry on moving forward and evolving, and still manage to connect with an arena full of people – fuck it, that would be fantastic! But it’s not the reason why we do what we do. We won’t change to get there.” “That’s true,” agrees Rhydian. “The point is to reach as many people as possible – but for all the right reasons.” Their charming reticence may soon become immaterial. The Joy Formidable have made an album so colossal, so compelling that it may even put Casco, Maine on the map. If there is any justice in the world, 2013 will be the Year of the Wolf.","<p>Not a lot goes down in Casco, Maine.

Over the past five years, Cambridge has been recognized as a hotspot for the regeneration of shoegaze – first made popular by bands like My Bloody Valentine in the late 80s/early 90s – with the appearance of sub genres like metalgaze, stargaze, and spacegaze. Rossi’s former project, The December Sound was on the forefront of psychedelic shoegaze movement, epitomizing the “wall-of-sound” that was associated with this genre. However, after going on a hiatus in 2009, Rossi felt inspired to experiment freely with his own music. By fusing the electronic, synthetically hypnotic sounds of new wave with the reverb heavy, lyrically indistinguishable, and distorted features of shoegaze, Rossi is able to create, in his own words, “an electric wall of sound”. The dreamy soundscapes that Avoxblue creates are recreated live, and it is not uncommon to find yourself hypnotized for the entire duration of the set. Recent live performances, like his August 9th show with Memoryhouse and Twin Sister, have been causing a buzz in the live music circuit. His stunning visuals, live multi-tracking, and sense of the audience has been impressing local music critics and national touring acts. With an album scheduled to drop in early February, Avoxblue has been planning tour dates, both locally and nationally.

Nashville-based experimental/psychedelic rock band LINEAR DOWNFALL explores musical dimensions that most bands dare cross into. Band members Charlee Cook (vocals, bass, synth), Chance Cook (guitar, vocals), Will Hicks (drums, keys) ,and Dom Marcoaldi (guitar, etc) are all multi-instrumentalists and share a passion for creativity. Their debut album, Daydreaming at Night (released October 2009), introduced listeners to music that inspired them to open their mind to a new sound. gloomillume (released December 2010) is a concept album that begins on earth in the midst of the apocalypse and ends on a beautiful planet called gloomillume. This fifteen-song combustion of originality fuses multiple musical styles. The “gloom” is present in songs like Just a # (a glitchy, bass-driven, view of the inside of a mental hospital), a Wave of (an ambient, tranquil, emotional experience), and Pick.Pull.Claw (a psychedelic, acidic, composition). The transition from dark to light takes place during Projector Eyes (chaos into 60s sunshine pop). The “illume” half of the album produces songs like Intergalactic Festivity (A disco space party hopping genres), and Rainbow Don’t Go (electronic pop). Another facet of LINEAR DOWNFALL often experienced is their outward expression of their music through a dynamic theatrical stage show. Fans are drawn into the adventure and encouraged to participate, releasing their own interpretation of the music and free-flowing expression. In 2012, Linear Downfall had a very crazy and ambitious year. They added a new member, Dom, on guitar to help fill out their layered sound, went and recorded at Wayne Coyne’s (Flaming Lips’ frontman) house, played two songs “21st Century Schizoid Man” (a King Crimson cover) and the Flaming Lips/Lightning Bolt Collaboration “I’m Working at NASA on Acid” live on the O Music Awards on stage with the Flaming Lips, was a part of the remake of King Crimson’s 1969 debut album “In the Court of the Crimson King” featuring the Flaming Lips, Stardeath and White Dwarfs, New Fumes, and Space Face with Linear Downfall on “21st Century Schizoid Man” and collaborating with the all of the bands on the song “Epitaph”,and supported the album with the “Exploding the Moon a Million Times” tour with Stardeath and White Dwarfs, New Fumes, and Space Face. They also completed their third album entitled “Fragmental Hippocampus” which is their most experimental and personal album to date. Linear Downfall has big plans for the future including some interesting albums and lots of touring.","<p>From <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lineardownfall/info"">Facebook</a>:<br><br><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;"">Are you happy, sad, laughing, crying, smiling, frightened, or all of the above at the same time?

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/fitz-and-the-tantrums","Fitz and the Tantrums","Los Angeles, CA","indie, pop, soul","In just a year or so, soulsters Fitz & the Tantrums went from the living room to the main stage. The recipe for meteoric success? Six killer musicians, five dapper suits, irresistible songs, some serendipity and one vintage organ. Since their first show at Hollywood’s Hotel Café in December 2008, Fitz and co. have toured with Maroon 5, played to thousands at Colorado’s world famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre, shared the stage New Year’s Eve with Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, and performed on KCRW’s esteemed show, Morning Becomes Eclectic. All this on the strength of their stellar five-song EP, Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1. For some bands, it takes a lifetime to build this success, but few performers deliver an unrestrained blast of soul-clapping, get-down-on-the-floor, moneymaker shakers like Fitz and the Tantrums. Now post-release of their debut full length, Pickin’ Up the Pieces, which has since earned them a 3 ½ star album review in ROLLING STONE, the troupe is poised to get down in dancehalls across the universe. It all began when… [cue flashback sounds] “I got a call from my ex-girlfriend,” Fitz explains, “And she said, ‘My neighbor is moving out in a hurry and has to sell everything. And, he has this organ…” Fitz, the Svengali frontman of the crew, describes the find like the discovery of a compass, or that treasure map in Goonies, which undoubtedly leads to adventure. Not one to say no, Fitz called some piano movers, cashed in some favors, and seven hours later, the organ went from the curb to his living room. That night, Fitz stationed himself in front of that vintage instrument and wrote a blue-eyed soul anthem, “Breaking the Chains of Love.” “Sometimes, the Music Gods just give it to you,” Fitz says. The overflow of inspiration startled Fitz. He’d spent years in L.A.’s music industry, writing music and working in a studio with Beck producer, Mickey Petralia. But at those 88 keys, just seven hours after that organ dropped into his life, Fitz had finally found his voice. “I’ve always been a singer,” Fitz says, “but with so much music, I felt that I was trying to push a square peg through a round hole. I was being not true to myself, and it never felt right until I wrote that song, and I sang like that. I thought, this feels so real, so natural.” Fitz shared his vision with long-time friend and saxophonist, James King, who immediately connected with the sound. While the electric guitar drives rock, the saxophone takes center stage in soul, and that’s the way Fitz likes it. “We wanted to find a new vocabulary for the genre, I wanted to make a record without any guitars. Could we make a huge sound with out any guitars?” A huge sound takes a huge studio—Motown had Studio A in Detroit, Philadelphia International had Sigma Studios, Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound was created in Hollywood’s legendary Gold Star Studios— but when it came time to capture the feeling and the soul of soul, Fitz knew of the perfect studio: his home. There in the living room, he recorded Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, a burst of effervescent swingers and floor-stompers, infused with the energy of long forgotten songs. The infectious, rolling rhythms of “Breaking the Chains of Love,” immediately turns your head and actually get cemented in your brain, like a good pop song should. The sound is familiar, but distinct. That’s what grabbed the attention of Maroon 5’s Adam Levine. Levine was getting a tattoo in New York when the tattoo artist told him he had to hear this new band he had discovered. After that one encounter, Levine personally invited Fitz and the Tantrums to join their tour. Like the EP, Fitz recorded the full-length debut back at home, to bottle the lightning that struck in those first jam sessions. He now delves into more acerbic lyrical territory, going on the offensive against gold diggers on the exceptionally funky “MoneyGrabber,” and even gets political on the piano-banging, handclap-driven call to action, “Dear Mr. President.” “L.O.V.” is a jaunt through pop music history embarking with a groovy organ intro, meandering through juicy big band breakdowns and Fitz’s svelte croons, then carrying us away with flute outro. It’s a funk-filled plea to give love a chance. These powerful songs take the band’s energy up a notch, but like their energized performances, they never loose control. Those blistering performances are now well-chronicled for adequate ubiquity, Last Call With Carson Daly nailing the money shot for “MoneyGrabber” at the band’s sold out show in November at LA’s El Rey Theatre featuring a sea of a thousand pogoing fans and a handful of F.A.T.T. gems rocked along with blue-eyed soul vet, Daryl Hall on the band’s spot on Live From Daryl’s House. Lest we forget, omnipresent the T-Mobile HTC ad that actually namechecks the band that, for the past several months, is impossible not to see if you’re watching even an hour’s worth of television. Oh, and there are the hot spots on Criminal Minds, Desperate Housewives and a great many more, not to mention a ton of success at radio for the aforementioned runaway “MoneyGrabber,” all with the promise of more to come. In their sound and on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are nothing but professionals, and never less than classy. Enter the Tantrums, Fitz’s airtight ensemble keeping it real like it’s1969. Funky drummer John Wicks is a Motown B-side aficionado and prolific session player, Jeremy Ruzumna manned the keyboards for Macy Gray, while King and bassist Ethan Phillips backed De La Soul (Phillips has since been replaced by Joseph Karnes). Then there’s Noelle Scaggs, the powerful voice behind Fitz’s croons. Make no mistake, Scaggs is not just there for “doo-wops” and handclaps. She shimmies and flirts, she stokes the crowd and simmers them down, and she has no qualms about keeping Fitz in check. “She is not just a backup singer,” Fitz says, “We have repartee. Onstage, we’re Ike and Tina.” There, on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are not just a band, they’re an explosion. Scaggs high steps it to the tight-as-hell rhythm section, while Fitz, cooler than cobalt, croons like the aforementioned Mr. Hall for a new generation. It’s obvious that this is no tryst for the band, this is a full-blown, head-over-heels love affair.

I thought, this feels so real, so natural.”<br /> <br><br> Fitz shared his vision with long-time friend and saxophonist, James King, who immediately connected with the sound. While the electric guitar drives rock, the saxophone takes center stage in soul, and that’s the way Fitz likes it. “We wanted to find a new vocabulary for the genre, I wanted to make a record without any guitars. Could we make a huge sound with out any guitars?”<br /> <br><br> A huge sound takes a huge studio—Motown had Studio A in Detroit, Philadelphia International had Sigma Studios, Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound was created in Hollywood’s legendary Gold Star Studios— but when it came time to capture the feeling and the soul of soul, Fitz knew of the perfect studio: his home. <br /> <br><br> There in the living room, he recorded Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1, a burst of effervescent swingers and floor-stompers, infused with the energy of long forgotten songs. The infectious, rolling rhythms of “Breaking the Chains of Love,” immediately turns your head and actually get cemented in your brain, like a good pop song should.<br /> <br><br> The sound is familiar, but distinct. That’s what grabbed the attention of Maroon 5’s Adam Levine. Levine was getting a tattoo in New York when the tattoo artist told him he had to hear this new band he had discovered. After that one encounter, Levine personally invited Fitz and the Tantrums to join their tour. <br /> <br><br> Like the EP, Fitz recorded the full-length debut back at home, to bottle the lightning that struck in those first jam sessions. He now delves into more acerbic lyrical territory, going on the offensive against gold diggers on the exceptionally funky “MoneyGrabber,” and even gets political on the piano-banging, handclap-driven call to action, “Dear Mr. President.” “L.O.V.” is a jaunt through pop music history embarking with a groovy organ intro, meandering through juicy big band breakdowns and Fitz’s svelte croons, then carrying us away with flute outro. It’s a funk-filled plea to give love a chance. These powerful songs take the band’s energy up a notch, but like their energized performances, they never loose control. <br /> <br><br> Those blistering performances are now well-chronicled for adequate ubiquity, Last Call With Carson Daly nailing the money shot for “MoneyGrabber” at the band’s sold out show in November at LA’s El Rey Theatre featuring a sea of a thousand pogoing fans and a handful of F.A.T.T. gems rocked along with blue-eyed soul vet, Daryl Hall on the band’s spot on Live From Daryl’s House. Lest we forget, omnipresent the T-Mobile <span class=""caps"">HTC</span> ad that actually namechecks the band that, for the past several months, is impossible not to see if you’re watching even an hour’s worth of television. Oh, and there are the hot spots on Criminal Minds, Desperate Housewives and a great many more, not to mention a ton of success at radio for the aforementioned runaway “MoneyGrabber,” all with the promise of more to come. <br /> <br><br> In their sound and on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are nothing but professionals, and never less than classy. Enter the Tantrums, Fitz’s airtight ensemble keeping it real like it’s1969. Funky drummer John Wicks is a Motown B-side aficionado and prolific session player, Jeremy Ruzumna manned the keyboards for Macy Gray, while King and bassist Ethan Phillips backed De La Soul (Phillips has since been replaced by Joseph Karnes). Then there’s Noelle Scaggs, the powerful voice behind Fitz’s croons. Make no mistake, Scaggs is not just there for “doo-wops” and handclaps. She shimmies and flirts, she stokes the crowd and simmers them down, and she has no qualms about keeping Fitz in check. “She is not just a backup singer,” Fitz says, “We have repartee. Onstage, we’re Ike and Tina.”<br /> <br><br> There, on the stage, Fitz and the Tantrums are not just a band, they’re an explosion. Scaggs high steps it to the tight-as-hell rhythm section, while Fitz, cooler than cobalt, croons like the aforementioned Mr. Hall for a new generation. It’s obvious that this is no tryst for the band, this is a full-blown, head-over-heels love affair. <br><br><a href=""http://do512.com/event/2011/02/09/do512-lounge-sessions-james-mcmurtry"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Watch videos of Fitz and The Tantrums playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!</a><br></p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/1567394/524a90eef82a68acdbef071815b26751_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/bEHHL3GBVps?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

He is one of the most prominent rappers in underground hip-hop, and is critically acclaimed frequently, despite not being incredibly commercially successful. His name is Arabic, meaning ‘the seeker’ or ‘student of truth and knowledge’. His parents were both college professors: his mother an English professor, his father a sociology professor. As a youth, he was drawn to Afrocentric rappers, such as De La Soul(LA LE LU) and other members of the Native Tongues Posse and soon began recording with producer Hi-Tek and rapper Mos Def who he met at central park, and later attended New York University with. With Mos Def (together the pair were known as Black Star), Kweli achieved some mainstream success with the eponymously titled album Black Star. (1998) While Mos Def went on to a solo career, Kweli released the Hi Tek-produced Reflection Eternal in 2000, which sold better than most alternative hip hop albums at the time. He has since released a critically acclaimed solo debut, Quality, in 2002. In 2004, Kweli released his second solo album, The Beautiful Struggle, which features production more akin to commercial rap, while Kweli’s lyrical content retains its powerful social-political content. His third solo album Ear Drum was released on August 21st, 2007 on Warner Bros./Blacksmith Music. Kweli has created his own record label, Blacksmith Records and has recently signed acclaimed female rapper Jean Grae, with rumors continuing to grow that underground veteran MF DOOM is the next artist to be picked up. He left Geffen Records and has signed with the Warner Music Group. He has since broken through slightly more towards the mainstream, thanks in large part to several appearance on the comedy show Chappelle’s Show, both solo and with long-time collaborator Mos Def, this is due to a friendship between the host and creator of the show, comedian Dave Chappelle and the rapper. He also had a guest spot on friend and frequent collaborator Kanye West‘s widely succesful debut album The College Dropout on the track ""Get ’Em High"". West has also produced some of Kweli’s songs, including his biggest commerical hit ""Get By"". He also can be seen in a commercial for the NCAA’s Big Ten Conference, rapping about the league’s basketball teams.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/ben-kweller","Ben Kweller","Greenville, TX (born in San Fran, live in Austin)","indie, singer-songwriter, indie rock","Ben Kweller was born in San Francisco, CA in 1981. In 1982 his family relocated to Emory, TX where his father Howard Kweller became the town’s first doctor. In 1986, The Kwellers moved to a much larger city, Greenville, TX. Ben was exposed to music at a very early age. Howard taught Ben how to play the drums when he was 7 years old. For the next year, the father and son would jam together almost every night after Howard got home from work. With Howard singing and playing guitar and Ben keeping the beat, the duo would play songs by The Beatles, The Hollies, Jimi Hendrix, and other artists of the 1960s. Howard is also a long-time friend of Nils Lofgren, the two went to high school together. When Ben turned 8, someone showed him how to play ""Heart And Soul"" on the piano. The youngster immediately began to create his own songs using the same chords. By the time he was 9 he had a dozen original compositions under his belt and entered a songwriting contest sponsored by Billboard magazine. Kweller won honorable mention. In 1993 Kweller became friends with another young local musician, drummer John Kent, and the two formed the band Radish with bassist Ryan Green. The trio played locally in and around Greenville, Texas and recorded two independent releases, ’’Hello’’ (1994) and ’’Dizzy’’ (1995), with Martin Baird at Verge Music Works recording studio in Dallas, Texas. Around the time of ’’Dizzy’s’’ release, Ryan Green decided to leave the band and focus his attention on school. Lorin Hamilton filled in for a few months until Bryan Bradford AKA Bryan Blur joined on for most of the band’s career. Ben sent a copy of ’’Dizzy’’ to Nils Lofgren. Nils was impressed with Radish and recommended them to Roger Greenawalt who was producing Lofgren’s album at the time, ‘’Damaged Goods’‘. Greenawalt took Radish into a studio where they recorded a demo tape which was subsequently shopped around to record labels nationwide, After an unexpected bidding war, Radish eventually signed to Mercury to release the album Restraining Bolt. Radish made appearances on ’’The Weird Al Show’’, ‘’Late Night with Conan O’Brien"" and ‘’Late Show with David Letterman’‘, but despite the much-hyped signing, the band failed to strike big success. Radish earned a large cult following in the United Kingdom with their top 40 hit ""Little Pink Stars"". The band toured several times in Europe including opening slots for Faith No More and Main Stage at Reading Festival ’97. Radish released two singles. In 1998 Radish became a quartet featuring Joe Butcher (Polyphonic Spree, Ufofu) on lead guitar and Debbie Williams on bass. Radish went to Muscle Shoals Studio in Alabama to record the follow-up to ’’Restraining Bolt’’, provisionally titled ‘’Discount Fireworks’‘. The band recorded with record producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, The Lemonheads). While mixing ’’Discount Fireworks’’ in NYC, Kweller and Kent met bassist Josh Lattanzi who would become Radish’s 5th and final bass player. As a result of Polygram’s merger with Universal Music Group, the 18-song album was never released and Radish soon secured a release from their contract with Mercury Records. At age 19, Ben Kweller moved to New York with his girlfriend Liz Smith, where he began his solo career. He played acoustic shows and self-released four EP’s, comprising some of the unreleased Radish ‘’Discount Fireworks’’ recordings and other songs recorded in his apartment on a laptop computer. It was one of these EPs, ‘’Freak Out, It’s Ben Kweller’’, that caught the attention of Evan Dando of The Lemonheads, and Dando invited Kweller out on tour with him, playing across America and Europe. Jeff Tweedy, Juliana Hatfield and Guster also began to notice Kweller and took him on tour with them In 2001 Ben Kweller became ATO Records’s first worldwide signing and released a 5-track EP entitled ‘’EP Phone Home’‘. In March 2002, ’’Sha Sha’’, Kweller’s first solo studio Album was released. ‘’Sha Sha’’ included the very radio-friendly and popular single ""Wasted & Ready"". The album featured John Kent on drums, Josh Lattanzi on bass, and showcased a wide variety of sound from Quirky Pop music to Folk to Punk. The album grew in popularity with a grassroots effort based on his website and a promotion group called teamBK, which promoted via word-of-mouth advertising. To support the release of the album and EP, he put together a live band, initially comprising Lattanzi on bass, Fred Eltringham on drums, and Mike Stroud on guitar and keyboards. Towards the end of the ‘’Sha Sha’’ album cycle, the four-piece performed on PBS’s Austin City Limits In 2003, Kweller toured Australia with Ben Folds and Ben Lee as The Bens. The trio produced an eponymous four-song EP, with each member taking lead vocals on one song, and a final song in which they all contributed vocals. In an interview on October 14 2006 Ben hinted that The Bens may do another album. Later in 2003, Kweller provided lead vocals on the song ""I Hope Tomorrow is Like Today"" from Guster’s album ‘’Keep It Together’‘. Kweller and Guster co-wrote the song after a late night jam at Gusters’ Brooklyn studio. The song is prominently featured in the movie The Wedding Crashers. ‘’On My Way’’ (2004), Kweller’s second album, went in a new direction. The album, produced by Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams, Kings of Leon), was recorded ‘live’ – there were limited overdubs and no use of headphones. After the release of On My Way, Kweller embarked on more touring, playing to his largest audiences ever, including a US tour co-headlining with Death Cab for Cutie. By this point, the lineup of his live band had changed to include John Kent on drums and Jason Roberts on guitar and keyboards, after Mike Stroud left to concentrate on his own band Ratatat and Fred Eltringham left to play drums in The Wallflowers. In 2006 he recorded his third album, ‘’Ben Kweller’’ with record producer, Gil Norton. Unlike the previous studio albums, Kweller played all the instruments on this record himself. Kweller continued to tour to support his self-titled album, and expanded his band into a five piece, which grew to include Dan Horne on bass, Mark Stepro on drums, Jay Barclay on guitar and organ, and Jason Roberts on lead guitar. Kweller continued to play guitar and piano on this tour, but it also gave him the opportunity to just sing on certain songs. His tie-in ""Trio on the Train Track Tour"" included a new live band comprising Chris Morrissey on bass and Mark Stepro on drums. During the Australian leg of the tour, the band was composed of Jay Barclay on guitar, Dan Horne on bass and Mark Stepro continuing on drums. As part of his 2006 tour, Kweller played the Austin City Limits Music Festival, where he was plagued by a severe nosebleed for the entirety of his set. After covering his guitar in blood, he attempted to stop the flow by inserting a travel-size tampon thrown onto the stage by a fan, which expanded painfully during a performance of ""This Is War."" After attempting to play ""Falling"" at the piano, which also became covered in blood, Kweller was forced to end the set early. In the Spring of 2007, Kweller co-headlined with his label-mates Gomez. He continued through the summer with his own string of headlining dates which eventually ended at another appearance at ACL fest. This time no bloody nose, however, commemorative T-shirts were sold at the merch booth with fake blood stains that said ""ACL 2007: The return of Ben Kweller"". Immediately following his performance at ACL, Kweller began recording his fourth full-length LP, ‘’Changing Horses’’ in Austin, Texas on September 21, 2007. The album features the trio on the train tracks, and Pedal Steel/Dobro player Kitt Kitterman. In 2008, Kweller re-signed with ATO Records who will be releasing ‘’Changing Horses’’ in early 2009. Listen at Last.fmThe fact that Ben Kweller didn't quite break out as the teen grunge god that his early buzz seemed to peg him as has only served him well in the long run. In the mid-'90s, when Kweller was only 15, the New Yorker dedicated a feature story to him and his Dallas-area rock band, Radish, that suggested they might very well be the next Nirvana. It didn't happen. But after Radish fell short of expectations, Kweller emerged as a prodiciously talented singer-songwriter whose razor-sharp pop instincts made all that early hype actually seem conservative. In 2002, Kweller moved from Texas to New York and launged his solo career with the promising Freak Out…It's Ben Kweller, followed by 2002's even better Sha Sha, a hodgepodge of pop from piano to pop that found a music genius showing the true bredth of his abilities to the world for the first time. His third album, 2004's On My Way, was his finest effort to date, boasting both a tighter focus and, impossibly, even catchier songs. Kweller, a proud veteran of both the Austin City Limits TV show and the ACL Festival, will no doubt have plenty of new songs to share at Zilker Park this year, as September happeens to be the target release month for his next record, simply titled Ben Kweller. In addition to recording his own album, Kweller also recently traveled to France to produce a record by another ACL Festival '06 performer, Pierre Guimard; that record hists stores in September, too.","<p>Ben Kweller was born in San Francisco, CA in 1981.

In 2008, Kweller re-signed with <a href=""http://www.last.fm/label/ATO+Records/"" class=""bbcode_label""><span class=""caps"">ATO</span> Records</a> who will be releasing ‘’Changing Horses’’ in early 2009. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Kweller"" target=""_blank"">Listen at Last.fm</a><br />The fact that Ben Kweller didn't quite break out as the teen grunge god that his early buzz seemed to peg him as has only served him well in the long run. In the mid-'90s, when Kweller was only 15, the New Yorker dedicated a feature story to him and his Dallas-area rock band, Radish, that suggested they might very well be the next Nirvana. It didn't happen. But after Radish fell short of expectations, Kweller emerged as a prodiciously talented singer-songwriter whose razor-sharp pop instincts made all that early hype actually seem conservative. In 2002, Kweller moved from Texas to New York and launged his solo career with the promising Freak Out…It's Ben Kweller, followed by 2002's even better Sha Sha, a hodgepodge of pop from piano to pop that found a music genius showing the true bredth of his abilities to the world for the first time. His third album, 2004's On My Way, was his finest effort to date, boasting both a tighter focus and, impossibly, even catchier songs. Kweller, a proud veteran of both the Austin City Limits TV show and the <span class=""caps"">ACL</span> Festival, will no doubt have plenty of new songs to share at Zilker Park this year, as September happeens to be the target release month for his next record, simply titled Ben Kweller. In addition to recording his own album, Kweller also recently traveled to France to produce a record by another <span class=""caps"">ACL</span> Festival '06 performer, Pierre Guimard; that record hists stores in September, too.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7613976/97179210ed82cb46278f2552d6ff7527_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/-CRPLtpTJUI?enablejsapi=1&version=3"
"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-trishas-","The Trishas","Austin, TX","","The four principal members of Austin’s The Trishas would have you believe that they’re not blood related. But a DNA test might be in order. True, their individual bios may support their claims of having all had separate lives before meeting each other; but to hear them sing together, you’d swear they were harmonizing from the womb. Then again, sometimes luck and fate sing in perfect harmony, too, and uncontested magic just happens — just as it did the very first time Jamie Wilson, Kelley Mickwee, Liz Foster and Savannah Welch ever shared a stage together. It was ostensibly supposed to be a one-off gig — two songs as part of a tribute to Savannah’s father, famed songwriter Kevin Welch, at the 2009 MusicFest in Steamboat Springs, Colo. But midway through their first practice, it became clear to all in the room that they were on to something good. Goosebumps don’t lie. “I remember we were at Kevin’s house, working up one of his songs — I think it was ‘Satan’s Paradise’ — when I first heard it,” Wilson recalls. “We were going over the song, figuring out our parts and everything, and we tried it and didn’t hit it, tried it again and didn’t hit it … until one time, finally, we actually got it, and I thought, ‘Cool!’ And then we worked up the whole song, and all of us were like, ‘You know, this is actually pretty good. We’re actually going to be pretty good — if we can pull this off.’” By all accounts, they did indeed pull off “Satan’s Paradise” at the Welch tribute. But it was their gorgeous way with “Till I’m Too Old to Die Young” that really killed — and still does, on the rare occasions when they still perform it. “We only do it now at a certain kind of special gigs, if the mood feels right,” explains Savannah. Fortunately, they captured it perfectly in the studio for their self-released debut, They Call Us The Trishas. The five-song “mini album” (don’t call it an EP!) is the perfect calling card for the Trishas, distilling the essence of their full live show into a svelte 20 minutes that also proves they can write songs every bit as striking as their voices, as shown by the sterling originals “Give It Away,” “Rise Above” and “So Blue.” They Call Us The Trishas was released to warm reviews and enthusiastic fan reaction in August 2010, after the group had already chased their successful MusicFest debut with nearly two solid years’ worth of buzz- and confidence-building shows. Most of those were in and around their home base of Austin (the self-styled “Live Music Capital of the World”), but there were also strategic forays throughout the rest of Texas and points beyond. It wasn’t long before they began nabbing plumb opening-act gigs with the likes of Dwight Yoakam, Raul Malo, Rodney Crowell, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Todd Snider, as well as studio work singing on two of 2010’s most acclaimed Americana releases, Kevin Welch’s A Patch of Blue Sky and Ray Wylie Hubbard’s A. Enlightenment, B. Endarkenment (Hint: There Is No C). Hubbard also secured them a spot onstage singing backup for Joe Walsh at his 2011 Grit ’N Groove Festival in the Texas Hill Country. As potent as they all are as a unit, it’s the combo plate of unique styles and personalities each Trisha brings to the table that makes the group truly, well, sing. “We all have different strengths,” says Liz, “and because of that we’ve been able to educate each other in a lot of different things. I think that’s what’s really connected us more and made us stronger, being able to feed off each other.” To wit: Liz, with a background in Motown revues, stands out with her rafter-raising, gospel-mama boom of a voice and assertive harp. “Musically, Liz brings the Joe Cocker to the group — she’s the wailer,” says Jamie, who in turn leans more to the country/folk side of the fence and is the group’s primary guitarist. “Jamie’s our rock, because she’s the one who has been playing the longest and is the best and the strongest at it,” says Kelley. “Like, we can’t do a gig without her.” Kelley, born in Birmingham and raised in Memphis, brings a heaping helping of bluesy, southern soul to the mix — along with what Jamie calls “a very strong right hand” on mandolin that keeps the band in rhythmic step sans a bass player. And Savannah? “I bring the learning curve,” she offers. “I’m the rookie on deck.” The others share her laugh, but note that she also brings a certain je nais ce quoi “chill factor.” “I don’t know how to describe it, but Savannah’s got a really, really strong voice that has the most delicate little break in it,” observes Jamie. “There’s not really a classification for it, but it’s like the Patty Griffin thing, where there’s just a lot of movement.” Jamie, a native of Sealy, Texas, cut her teeth playing in the alt-country band The Gougers, which recorded four albums over the course of seven years before she struck out on her own with a solo EP, 2008’s Dirty Blonde Hair. San Antonio-born Liz started performing in her teens, singing in various rock and soul cover bands before finding her own artistic voice in Liz and Lincoln, a promising but short-lived duo project with her ex, songwriter Lincoln Durham. Meanwhile, Kelley spent five years touring in a rootsy Americana duo, Jed and Kelley, with her ex, a stint that produced two albums. Savannah was born and raised in Nashville but spent her early adulthood marinating amongst the punks and rockers of Austin’s music scene. She sang backup in her brother Dustin’s rock band and dabbled in songwriting, but spent most of her time pursuing a career in film acting. For now, though, Hollywood will just have to wait, because outside of immediate family — most notably, Jamie’s baby daughter, Joanie (already a road veteran) — The Trishas’ priority No. 1 is working toward the completion of their next album. In 2010, they were signed to a group publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music in Nashville, and they’ve been diligently writing, stockpiling and rehearsing new songs while also fortifying and expanding their grassroots audience by touring more and more outside of Texas. And should the right record deal present itself along the way, well, they’ll weigh their options with savvy, road-hardened Trisha street smarts. “We’re just trying really hard to not have to change anything about ourselves,” Kelley explains. “It’s real hard, but it can be done that way.” “What matters is being able to respect the music that you make 20 years from now,” concludes Jamie, the others nodding in perfect Trisha harmony. “It’s more of a career thing than a go-be-a-star thing.”","<p>The four principal members of Austin’s The Trishas would have you believe that they’re not blood related.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/kitten","Kitten","Los Angeles, CA","","For Chloe Chaidez, frontwoman of the electrifying rock group Kitten, the trajectory from rock fan to rock star began in carpool. “Growing up my dad had to drive an hour and half every day five days a week to take me to gymnastics,” she recalls. Chloe’s father, a drummer from LA’s early punk scene, used this time to communicate the important things in life to his young daughter: Mott the Hoople, David Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. “We listened to lots of classic rock,” Chloe recalls. “But we also played the new CMJ mixes. This is pre-internet and that’s how you learned about new bands, from little CDs that came with cool magazines. Bands like Sigur Ross, Band of Horses…” By ten Chloe had begun playing bass and had formed her own band. By 12 she was opening for indie artists such as Midlake and Conor Oberst with her blend of hip covers and precocious originals. “I probably watched School of Rock 100 times,” Chloe says, laughing. “That was all I wanted to do.” It’s not a surprise that Chloe was so naturally drawn to the rebel artists’ life. Both her mom and dad are creative and the singer’s older brother, the scholar in the family, also dabbles in music. “School is really his thing,” Chloe says. “ Mathematics. But he’s also a really natural musician.” School was not Chloe’s thing. “I got into a lot of trouble from a very early age,” she remembers. Music was all that ever held her attention but within that particular world she is as educated as they come. A consummate rock nerd, she can easefully narrate the creative through-line from My Bloody Valentine to Washed Out, discuss her appreciation of everyone from Cat Power to the Notorious B.I.G., then pivot to music business speak to dissect Grimes’ marketability in the mainstream. “People always say, oh she’s so young but the thing is, I have been doing this for a really long time already,” Chloe says. “I love it. As cliché as it sounds, it’s my life. It’s all I do.” While writing songs, recording, and performing live have been a major part of her daily life over the last few years, what’s been more of a challenge, she says, is learning how to focus her vision. “You can write a song on an acoustic guitar and it can sound any way you want. It can be anything you want it to be” she explains. “But over the last year or two, I’ve realized the particular music that I actually wanted to make, the sound I wanted and the point of view that I wanted it to come from.” The path to this realization wasn’t without it’s rough patches. Ironically after signing her record deal, at the peak of her first small wave of success, when she should have been the happiest, Chloe nearly lost herself in rock and roll cliché. “I would drink before and after shows… do drugs,” Chloe remembers. “The real problem was that I couldn’t stop myself. It wasn’t just about fun. I was frustrated, scared and confused and I wanted to kill those feelings, but I justified it by saying this is the rock and roll life style. It’s okay to do this ‘cause so did Iggy Pop, so did Lou Reed. Maybe I would write my own “Heroin” someday. But the thing is, drugs really do kill your creativity and they almost ruined my career before it even really started. That lifestyle, how I was living it, it lowers you. We almost had to shut the whole thing down. Part of the turnaround of this record is that I looked around and said, ‘Wait a minute. This isn’t a joke. This is my life. This is what I care about. What the hell am I doing?’” Back in LA, away from distractions, Chloe was finally clear-headed enough to truly explore what kind of music she wanted to make. Through songwriting collaborations with her manager and musical mentor, Chad Anderson, the singer started to hone in on her now signature sound. The ferocious power of late 70’s post punk blended with the textures and rhythms of 80’s British new wave and the shoegaze wall of sound, executed with an emotional delicacy all too rare for today. Soon after Chloe started messing around with computer rock at home with her brother, the stage was set for Kitten to rise. “I felt stuck with the band format’s mostly organic instruments so I started making beats with my brother in our bedrooms,” she remembers. “I found it really liberating.” Soon after I started falling in love with 80’s new wave, most of it British. Pet Shop Boys, OMD, Psychedelic Furs, New Order, The Eurythmics, American artists like The Motels and ‘till Tuesday, Prince… Liberating is a good descriptor for Kitten’s EP. A blend of the sophisticated elegance of dream pop with the jagged directness of rock and roll, it’s a declaration of intent and an auspicious announcement of the arrival of a new force in music. The title track “Cut It Out” has the sweetness of a delicate pop song underscored by a massive futuristic backbeat. “G#” is a reverb-drenched reinvention of classic shoegazer rock, slashed through with razor guitars and songs like “Sugar” showcase Chloe’s willingness to be intimate and vulnerable even from within these layers of raucous noise. From considered near-ballads, to epic walls of sound the EP showcases the dynamic range of Chloe’s young band. It’s almost as if Chloe Chaidez has been in training for close to a decade and is now ready for the major leagues. She’s always had the talent and the belief but now she has the sense of self and identity to back it up. “What’s going to make this band different is our live show,” says the singer, when asked what truly distinguishes Kitten. “I love being onstage more than anything. When you are up there you can do whatever you want. You can be whatever you want. If there’s one person in the back of the room not involved, then that’s my audience. I’ll do whatever I have to do to blow that person away. I want everybody in the audience to remember where they were when they saw Kitten for the first time.”","<p>For Chloe Chaidez, frontwoman of the electrifying rock group Kitten, the trajectory from rock fan to rock star began in carpool. “Growing up my dad had to drive an hour and half every day five days a week to take me to gymnastics,” she recalls.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/josh-ritter","Josh Ritter","Moscow, Idaho","singer-songwriter, folk, acoustic","Over the clatter of piano and strum of an electric guitar that opens his fourth studio album, Josh Ritter leaps into rapid-fire lyrics that reference Joan of Arc, Calamity Jane and Florence Nightingale, all of whom seem to be stuck together in the belly of a whale. As the follow-up to last year's critically-acclaimed album The Animal Years, The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter is his most adventurous, fresh, and freewheeling work to date. While The Animal Years was a meticulously crafted and stately paean, for Conquests the artist radically revamped his working methods and his sound. “I needed to be somebody different,” the singer says. “The air of gravitas around me was getting oppressive. For some reason it seemed like there was a premium being placed on earnestness and that can be pretty stifling. There was a lot of talk about true love and righteous indignation. I wanted to write about gunslingers and missile silos.” The result is an often raucous, occasionally dizzying affair, with pounding keyboards, strings, horns, and his new producer and long-time collaborator Sam Kassirer, leading the charge. About the recording conditions in the Maine farmhouse where the record was made, Ritter enthuses, “You should have seen it up there. It was January and twenty below. We had horns in the attic, we had strings in the barn, we had a gaggle of people shooting targets with bb guns in the woods. It was a full house and everyone was there to throw themselves at the music. There was no holding back.” The artistic leaps Josh Ritter displays on Conquests are not without their stepping-stones, however. On a conceptual level, Paul McCartney’s Ram served as an ever-present reminder to enjoy the process of writing. Ritter was attracted to the free-spirited quality of the solo album McCartney made at his own farmhouse—amidst the Beatles’ tumultuous breakup: “It sounded like he had something to prove, but also like he didn’t really care. In terms of my favorite records, Ram is more about the philosophy. If this guy can do this after what he came through, then, okay, maybe I could try something like this too. It really loosened me up.” Stepping farther back, he cites Buddy Holly’s apocryphal ""The Apartment Tapes"" as a major influence. “A friend passed me Buddy Holly’s Apartment Tapes. The tapes are plain and genius. Buddy sang ‘Learning the Game’ and ‘That’s What they Say’ in his apartment in New York City and you can hear his wife bumping around in the kitchen and the whole thing feels clear but not simple. Those recordings feel like a Raymond Carver story. I listen to him and remember that it doesn’t have to be all nine-minute songs. That guy can get more across in a couplet than some people are lucky to learn in their whole life.” Given the new lyrical and musical trails that he is blazing, The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter proves that one can still cross any number of Rubicons all the while not taking themselves too seriously. Historic indeed.","<p align=""left""> Over the clatter of piano and strum of an electric guitar that opens his fourth studio album, Josh Ritter leaps into rapid-fire lyrics that reference Joan of Arc, Calamity Jane and Florence Nightingale, all of whom seem to be stuck together in the belly of a whale.

But musically, St Lucia’s heart lay elsewhere, and South Africa was full of other rhythms. “My mom says I used to sing along to Michael Jackson,” he says – an ordinary anecdote, until he adds, “when I was an infant.” As a young teenager, he started to feel that he’d had his fill of classical, and it felt like an epiphany when he discovered the direct emotionality of pop. Eventually, he left the creative “small pond” of South Africa for England, where he spent three years studying music in Liverpool.St. Lucia’s journey ended – as so many journeys do – in New York City, where he started working on the tracks that would ultimately turn into his self titled debut release on Neon Gold. The atmospheric quality of St. Lucia’s electronic pop is powerful, with the musician’s global travels and history of secret hideaways effortlessly passed onto the audience through his dreamy, shimmering synths.Neon Gold will release St Lucia’s debut album later this year.

Whilst the band might not share actual familial bonds, the ties that keep this Nashville 6-piece together are just as strong.The Family began creating music together in Nashville in Fall 2007. What began as late night talks about life and dreams gradually flowed into eccentric, beautiful music. Kelsey and Gabe settled on the name (Kelsey’s last name lent itself well to a sort of ‘family band’ name), and recruited their friends to join the fold.Gabe (guitar, vocals) and Kelsey (vocals, keys) lead the family, along with Steven (lead guitar), Corey (bass), Markus (cello), and David (drums). The music is emotive, the lyrics evoking raw honesty and vulnerability. The band will undoubtedly capture your attention with their unmistakable power and presence. The sounds created by the booming and orchestral-like 6-piece challenge the listener’s ear and yet offer sweet melodies to sing along with. You’ll be dancing up a storm by the end of a Kopecky set, and perhaps also be holding a maraca or two!The band debuted their first EP, Embraces in 2008. In spring of 2010, the family packed into their 15-passenger van (lovingly called “The War Wagon”, RIP) and headed to Austin for their first SXSW. It was during their performance at Next Big Nashville in the same year that they picked up steam, catching the ears of some influential folks. They headed back into the studio after this with Partners in Crime, Russ Long and Chris Grainger (Wilco) and produced The Disaster EP which was released in August 2010.They trekked to New York City the same year, hitting up CMJ where they won over NPR‘s own Bob Boilen; and were invited to play the official Paste Magazine showcase. Straight back into the studio after CMJ, the band produced the follow up to The Disaster, the perfect compliment entitled Of Epic Proportions. The EP comprised digital B-Sides & rarities including “Howlin’ at the Moon“ and a remix of “God & Me”.A limited edition split 7″ vinyl with Seattle friends Ivan & Alyoshafollowed, as did several more tours and another SXSW jaunt. The band played 7 or so showcases this time around, with a marked performance at the infamous Paste Magazine showcase. And to keep themselves really busy early in 2011, the band played the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, notching up 3 amazing sets and amassing several new friends and fans along the way. In other 2011 news, a deal was inked management company Red Light. Large tours alongside GIVERS and Gomez helped close out a super successful year, as did another visit to CMJ.Early 2012 finally meant a break in the band’s relentless touring schedule, and the chance to get away to work on their debut full-length album, which had already begun with ideas and songs being hatched whilst on the road. After a co-headlining tour with The Lumineers in April, the family once again bunkered down to put the finishing touches on the album.

It wasn’t until three years later that they would find the proper environment to record their first single “Long Journey” which now bookends their self-titled release. These were the kind of songs that bounced between London and Los Angeles, the kind of thing that could have come from Mick Jagger or Arthur Lee or both at once, with crystalline guitar and slow-mo drums that recalled the way the waves take big bites of the beach at night. This was mystery music from the strange and ancient-modern California fringe, more Night Tide than Easy Rider.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/titi-robin-trio","Titi Robin Trio","Angers, France","","Titi Robin is a self-taught musician born in the late 1950s in Western France. Robin creates a musical world for himself instinctively assimilating elements in response to his need to express himself while developing a perfect balance of Gypsy and Arab influences in his music. Long before the World Music trend exploded on the international scene, the Gypsy and Arab communities were open and encouraging Titi at a time when French mainstream music failed to move him musically or emotionally. The Gypsy and Arab community’ celebrations provided Robin with the opportunity to test his original music against these rich traditions from which he took his inspiration. Inspired by but never imitating, Robin obstinately looked for the best way to express himself as a contemporary artist while drawing on these rich musical cultures. Titi Robin Trio is the most open of Titi Robin’s lineups and is based on improvisation allowing each musician to play equally and meet each other on continuously renewed musical roads within Titi Robin’s repertoire. During performances, the three musicians alternate between soloists and backing interpreters. It relieves Robin from his usual leadership role and provides him with cherished musical freedom to explore new grounds. Thanks to the experience and musical knowledge of Francis and Ze, Titi is able to take risks and shine new light on his music.","<p>Titi Robin is a self-taught musician born in the late 1950s in Western France.

He has immersed himself completely in a world of delicate symphonic compositions generating near weightless orchestral pieces. Arnalds explores the crossover from classical to pop by mixing chamber strings and piano with discreet electronics which makes him a perfect fit for cinematic music label Erased Tapes. His motivations are clear: ‘The classical scene is kind of closed to people who haven’t been studying music all their lives. I would like to bring my classical influence to the people who don’t usually listen to this kind of music…open people’s minds.’ Through relentless touring and determination this young artist has steadily gained recognition worldwide since his 2007 debut ‘Eulogy for Evolution’. His 2008 follow-up EP ‘Variations of Static’ earned Ólafur acclaim from both the contemporary and classical field – transcending a traditional divide. He has sold out some of the world’s most renowned music venues including Barbican Hall in London and has been awarded ‘Best Live Session of 2008’ by BBC Radio 1 presenter Gilles Peterson. Over the past eighteen months Arnalds has advanced from a former support-act for Sigur Rós to an internationally respected artists in his own right. In April 2009 Arnalds created the 7 song series ‘Found Songs’ – recording a song a day for 7 days and instantly making each track available via Twitter and the official Erased Tapes website with over 300.000 people downloading for free. December 2009 saw the release of Ólafur’s contemporary dance score ‘Dyad 1909’, commissioned by the award-winning choreographer Wayne McGregor. The dance piece, inspired by Shackleton’s South Pole premiered at the Sadler’s Wells theatre in October 2009 and became a much talked about 5-nights of live music, dance and visuals. BBC Four, the ITV1 South Bank Show and Arte TV Europe broadcasted ‘Dyad 1909’ on primetime television. In March 2010 he embarked on his first ever China Tour, which included sold-out shows in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing, and a live webcast watched by thousands of fans all round the world. Ólafur Arnalds’ second full-length album ‘…and they have escaped the weight of darkness’, continues his mission to lure an indie-generation of pop and rock fans into an emotive world of beguiling electronic chamber music and delicate classical arrangements. The sense of an organic crossover recording is reinforced by the involvement of co-producer Barði Jóhannsson of eccentric pop/rock/electronica-formation Bang Gang. Those expecting a mere continuation of the minimal melancholia of his previous albums are in for a surprise, as the record may be the most uplifting and richly orchestrated work of his career. ‘Precocious Nordic composer’s sumptuous second LP … Timeless and sublime’ **** – UNCUT ‘An artist of immense maturity’ (9/10) – Drowned In Sound","<p>Born in 1986, Ólafur hails from the suburban Icelandic town of Mosfellsbær, just a few kilometres outside of Reykjavík.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/jovanotti","Jovanotti","Cortona, Italy","hip-hop, pop, rap, italian","The 2011 Bonnaroo performance by the polyglot Tuscan artist Jovanotti (nee Lorenzo Cherubini) won over American live music fans, critics and industry alike. Among those taken by Jovanotti’s artistry and charisma was the leadership of ATO Records, which will introduce American audiences to him with Italia 1988-2012, a career retrospective including four new tracks, on August 7. This is the artist’s first physical album of studio recordings to be released in the U.S., and the first time much of the material has been released here in any format. Rather than a greatest hits collection, album producer Ian Brennan compiled and remixed what he considers Jovanotti’s most compelling material—the songs that exemplify the latter’s reputation as a Springsteen-style rock poet and a distinctive singer. (Jovanotti laughingly reacted to some of Brennan’s choices with, “Are you sure I recorded that song?”) The album also includes four altogether-new tracks: the new songs “New York for Life” and “Con La Luce Negli Occhi,” and radical reworkings of Jovanotti’s songs “La Porta É Aperta” (from the Ora album) and”Mezzogiorno” (from the Safari album). Brennan is a longtime Jovanotti fan who won a Grammy earlier this year for Tinariwen’s Tassili (Anti-); produced the debut of Rain Machine, the solo project of Kyp Malone (TV on the Radio); has helmed Grammy-nominated albums by Peter Case and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott; and has worked with Flea, Lucinda Williams, Nels Cline (Wilco), Fugazi, Green Day, Merle Haggard, Corin Tucker (Sleater-Kinney), Bill Frisell, Jonathan Richman and others. Jovanotti has already achieved rock star status in much of the rest of the world. In his native Italy, over the course of 25 years, he has sold over five million albums. Jovanotti’s most recent studio album, 2011’s Ora (Now), debuted at #1 there, went on to become the best-selling album of the year, and resulted in sell-outs over 50 arena and stadium dates. In the last few years, he has graced the cover of the Italian editions of Rolling Stone, GQ, Vanity Fair and L’Uomo Vogue, among other magazines. Outside Europe, Jovanotti has long been a favorite of Latin American listeners and artists, including Oscar winner Jorge Drexler and Juanes, with whom Jovanotti has collaborated live and on recent recordings. Although Jovanotti is still in his early 40s, a whole generation of younger Latin alternative artists grew up admiring him; he has in turn invited Los Amigos Invisibles, Ana Tijoux, Bomba Estereo and others to open for him on recent tours. Jovanotti has begun to spend a considerable amount of his time and career energies in the U.S. In the summer of 2009, he and a mostly US-based band performed 16 sold-out shows at downtown New York clubs. He has returned for brief stints in other parts of this country, including a performance at Central Park SummerStage in 2010, and earlier this year, with TV on the Radio, in The Music of The Rolling Stones Hot Rocks 1964-1971 at Carnegie Hall. This fall, Jovanotti will move to New York for a year. The relocation is a sort of return to origins for the artist, who counts The Beastie Boys as his primary influence (and, later in his life, collaborators and friends). When Jovanotti performed at the Bowery Ballroom in March 2012, he sang some lines from “No Sleep till Brooklyn.” He was not only acknowledging his whereabouts, but his beginnings, when he sported a sideways baseball cap and a “Get Off My Dick” t-shirt on the cover of his 1988 debut, the rap album Jovanotti for President.","<p>The 2011 Bonnaroo performance by the polyglot Tuscan artist Jovanotti (nee Lorenzo Cherubini) won over American live music fans, critics and industry alike.

When Jovanotti performed at the Bowery Ballroom in March 2012, he sang some lines from “No Sleep till Brooklyn.” He was not only acknowledging his whereabouts, but his beginnings, when he sported a sideways baseball cap and a “Get Off My Dick” t-shirt on the cover of his 1988 debut, the rap album Jovanotti for President.</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7565375/a0e6fb059f4850a4454df2887666edbd_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/cFOIWoiKK-g?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

After sitting in the orgone box planted in Burroughs’ back yard of Lawrence, Kansas in the midpoint of the 1990s, Thurston Moore came to the realization that at some point he’d need to form a band that played Burroughs Rock.

His set is characterized by lively, rapid-fire renditions of his poems, usually performed a cappella. He opened for Be-Bop Deluxe on their 1977 U.K. tour and later for Rockpile on their 1979 U.S. tour. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clarke enjoyed some chart success in the UK with the single “Gimmix! Play Loud”,1 and subsequent album Snap, Crackle & Bop. In 1979 he applied to join actors’ union Equity, but as there was already a member named John Cooper Clarke, he joined under the name Lenny Siberia.2 Performing in Cardiff, 1979 Often referred to as “the bard of Salford”,1 he usually refers to himself on stage as “Johnny Clarke, the name behind the hairstyle”. His first job was a laboratory technician at the University of Salford.3 Having released a handful of records into the early 1980s, Clarke performed his live act less frequently, and spent much of that decade addicted to heroin.4 He made an appearance in two UK adverts for Sugar Puffs in 1988, taking second billing to the Honey Monster. More recently, Clarke has turned some of his stage act away from an emphasis on performance poetry and towards more of a stand-up-oriented affair, but poetry is still very much a key part of his performance. He also supported Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros. He can often be seen supporting The Fall on British tours or performing as a headlining act in his own right. He also duetted with a poem entitled Last Resort with Reverend Jon McClure at a Reverend and the Makers concert at London’s Spread Eagle, which Later was released as the b-side for the band’s single “Heavyweight Champion of the World”. Clarke also recorded a song with the band entitled “Dead Man’s Shoes”. Clarke’s recording of “Evidently Chickentown” from his album Snap, Crackle & Bop was also featured prominently in the closing scene of The Sopranos episode Stage 5. A live performance of the same poem appears in the film Control with Clarke portraying himself in a re-creation of a 1977 concert where he supported Joy Division, despite having aged 30 years since the events depicted in the movie. Clarke had a “domestic partnership” with singer Nico in the 1980s.5 At Bedford’s Rhythm Festival, 2006 Clarke appeared in a 1982 music documentary compilation Urgh! A Music War, where he performed his poem “Health Fanatic”.6 The film featured live performances of main-stream artists (The Police, The Go-Gos, Pere Ubu, XTC, Devo) as well as more obscure bands (The Alley Cats, Invisible Sex, Athletico Spizz ’80, Chelsea) using concert footage from around the world. For many people, this was their first introduction to the works of John Cooper Clarke. He also starred in another 1982 film titled Ten Years in an Open Necked Shirt, produced for the Arts Council of Great Britain and Channel 4. Somewhere between a narrative film, a series of music videos, and a documentary, the film features interviews and performances by the poet.7 His poem “Out of Control Fairground” was printed inside Arctic Monkeys’ single “Fluorescent Adolescent” CD, which was released on 9 July 2007. The poem is also the inspiration behind the single’s video in which clowns brawl. Another poem was printed inside the 10"" release of the same single. Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys has said he is very fond of Cooper Clarke’s work and takes inspiration for lyrics from his poems.89 A version of his poem “Evidently Chickentown” is performed at the start and end of the video for Joy Division’s “Transmission” single which shows John Cooper Clarke reading the refrain and third verse from the poem whilst coming down escalators and then walking in the Manchester Arndale Centre. As of 2011, Clarke is still writing and performing, and regularly plays gigs all over the UK and abroad, reading new material as well as older favourites.","<p>Clarke has opened for such acts as the Sex Pistols, The Fall, Joy Division, Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Elvis Costello, and New Order (at their May 1984 Music for Miners benefit concert at London’s Royal Festival Hall).

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/robyn-hitchcock","Robyn Hitchcock","London, UK","indie, singer-songwriter, alternative","Robyn Raymond Hitchcock (born March 3, 1953) is an English singer-songwriter and psych folk guitarist who also ventures into several forms of art, in particular painting and poetry, and has occasionally shown an interest in acting. While primarily a vocalist and guitarist, he also plays harmonica, piano and bass guitar. Many of Hitchcock’s album covers bear his paintings or drawings, and his albums’ liner notes sometimes include a printed short story. His live concerts usually include a considerable amount of story-telling, imaginative and surreal ad-libbed monologues in his lyrical style. Robyn is the son of novelist Raymond Hitchcock and the brother of artist Lal Hitchcock. He is not related to Alfred Hitchcock. Robyn is not possessed by demons, not really. He regularly does solo work, and returns again and again to bands he has formed like The Soft Boys and The Egyptians. Hitchcock is an avid and able collaborator with folks like director Jonathan Demme, actor Alan Rickman, country/folk duo (and longtime Hitchcock fans) Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, The Venus 3, R.E.M.‘s Peter Buck, Young Fresh Fellows’ frontman Scott McCaughey, Andy Partridge of XTC, Nick Lowe, former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, Jon Brion and Grant-Lee Phillips, as well as Ministry‘s Bill Rieflin. Hitchcock’s musical and lyrical styles have been influenced by his appreciation of Bob Dylan, Gregory Corso, The Byrds, Country Joe & the Fish, and Syd Barrett. Hitchcock’s lyrics are an essential component of his work and tend to include surrealism, comedic songs, characterizations of English eccentrics, plant roots, insects, trains, dreams, and melancholy depictions of everyday life. His themes include what many psychologists view as the roots of modern neurosis – namely, death, sex and eating. (As if in recognition of these themes, he released an EP in 2007 called ""Sex, Food, Death and Tarantulas"".) His fearless, wry, jovial, and nuanced approach to subjects that others avoid gives a depth and a refreshing playful thoughtfulness to his work. Often those who come to his well-crafted songs enjoy their stay, then leave with their humanity reaffirmed and their preconceptions satisfyingly loosened. Listen at Last.fm.. Sex, Food, Death and Tarantulas is the new EP from Robyn Hitchcock, the auteur of the highly-acclaimed album Ole! Tarantula, contains six live unreleased tracks including the Soft Boys classic, ""Give It to the Soft Boys,"" Hitchcock solo gems like ""Sometimes a Blonde,"" and the Venus 3's ""(A Man's Got to Know His Limitations )Briggs."" Also included is two videos for ""Adventure Rocketship"" from Ole! Tarantula – one live action video and a wistful stop motion animation rendering.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/girl-talk","Girl Talk","Pittsburgh, PA","dj, electronica, electronic, dance, mashup","Celebrating 10-plus years of sample-obsessed production and relentless touring, Gregg Gillis returns with All Day, his fifth album as Girl Talk, and his most epic, densely layered, and meticulously composed musical statement to date. Continuing the saga from the previously acclaimed albums, Night Ripper and Feed The Animals, Gillis lays down a more diverse range of samples to unfold a larger dynamic between slower transitions and extreme cut-ups. With the grand intent of creating the most insane and complex “pop collage” album ever heard, large catalogs of both blatantly appropriated melodies and blasts of unrecognizable fragments were assembled for the ultimate Girl Talk record (clocking in at 71 minutes and 372 samples). Since the release of Feed The Animals, things have flourished for Girl Talk. He’s played almost 300 shows and hardly taken a full week off from hitting the road. He’s playing even larger venues and making even more of a spectacle—he’s employed a small crew of toilet paper launching stage hands, who also propel confetti, balloons, and inflate oddly chosen props into the audience. For the New Year’s Eve show to ring in 2010, a team was hired to build a life-size house, with attention to fine details, on the stage at Chicago’s Congress Theatre. Described as the craziest house party ever, Girl Talk continues to please live audiences as the mass of sweaty bodies at his shows continually grows. Touring highlights from the last couple of years include the Vancouver Olympics, large festivals such as Coachella, Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, V-Fest, Sasquatch, Rothbury, Monolith, Planeta Terra, and trips to Australia, Japan, South America, Europe, and Mexico. Earlier this year, Girl Talk finally took a break from touring, festival dates, and college shows, in order to create an album that is being released immediately after its completion. While posting the album as a free download on the Illegal Art label’s site allows All Day to reach his fanbase quickly and with minimal cost, Gillis spent more time on this album than any previous release and considers it the most fully realized and evolved manifestation of the Girl Talk aesthetic.","<p>Celebrating 10-plus years of sample-obsessed production and relentless touring, Gregg Gillis returns with All Day, his fifth album as Girl Talk, and his most epic, densely layered, and meticulously composed musical statement to date.

He is currently signed to Kanye West’s G.O.O.D Music label and Island Def Jam. So far he has released two mixtapes, 2007’s Finally Famous and 2008’s U Know Big Sean. His debut album Finally Famous is set to drop sometime around Spring 2009 and will feature guest appearances from hip hop superstars such as Kanye West, Pharrell, The Dream, Kid Cudi and many more. He was raised by his mother and grandparents who worked steadfastly to instill in him the principles of hard work and determination. Sean attended the Detroit Waldorf School, a school of art, from Kindergarten to 8th Grade where he was introduced to a spectrum of art and culture. He later attended Cass Technical High School where he furthered his music career, met life long friends, and gained the support of fans and peers as he independently sold copies of his music. Sean gained a strong relationship with 102.7FM, a local radio station in Detroit where he displayed his rhyming skills weekly. There, he met Kanye West after a radio interview in 2005 and got a chance to display his talent by freestyling for Mr. West, giving him a copy of his music and sending numerous tracks for him to critique.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/rustie","RUSTIE","","","Glasgow’s talent pool clearly runs deep, and if the city’s last few years of genre-busting electronic music have made anything remotely clear it’s that Rustie is one of the deep-fried kingdom’s crown jewels. Emerging with the rest of the multi-talented Numbers crew, and with only a handful of laser-guided releases to his name, his presence far outreaches his focused, evolving discography. Rightly mentioned in the same breath with many of the most innovative producers in the world, astute Pitchfork scribe Martin Clarke once described Rustie’s music “like a metaphor for living in intense digital excess” – something everyone should be able to relate to. As is often the case, this digital excess also mirrors the excesses of the physical world, and so Rustie time travels for the cocaine-addled synthesizer washes and searing guitar tones of 1980’s pop, the cash-infused bombast of new-millennium R&B, the pit-of-your-stomach ecstasy high of the most classic rave memories and the bloodshot scowl of white-hot pirate radio broadcasts. In 2007, with a new generation of irreverent producers and artists seemingly simultaneously uploading their music to MySpace, Rustie’s Jagz The Smack EP was a miniature revelation. In a swift five tracks, it managed to not only synthesize the tone of mid-decade electronic music, but also provided a danceable prediction for much of what would soon be called “UK bass music” (not to mention many other, far less eloquent, names). It would take 3 more years to move through a string of now classic 12”s like “Zig-Zag”, “Bad Science” and “Play Doe/Tempered”, his collaboration with Bristol’s mighty Joker. This unfettered run was capped by a string of essential remixes (or “Resmacks” in the parlance of Rustie) for the likes of Jamie Lidell, Kelis, The Big Pink and Nicki Minaj, leading into his debut EP for Warp, Sunburst. In another breathless five-track flash, Sunburst amalgamated Rustie’s love for obscure Japanese prog-rock, 16-bit video game sonics and icy grime and Detroit techno heft into a fleeting vision of the future of rave music. Snare rolls ricocheted, synths undulated in hypercolor hues and the bass bubbled over, the stage was set. Now after taking shape in the studio over the course of the past two years, Glass Swords arrives, and as the otherworldly landscape of the album artwork suggests, it is epic and alien. Opening with the beguiling synth and guitar meditation that is the album’s title track, this is the last chance to take a deep breath before the rushing neon strains of bright melody and earthquake drums of “Flash Back” and Surph”. Next up “Hover Traps” references the twitchy slap-bass and punchy electronic chords of 80’s funk masters like Midnight Star and Lamont Dozier while “City Star” achieves the perfect balance of tunefulness and menace of the best grime productions. Through the middle of the record, a triptych of tracks present themselves as the model of the updated version of rave music Rustie has mastered. First single (and longtime club favorite) “Ultra Thizz” is all breakdowns and build-ups structured around whip-crack snare drums, while “Death Mountain” and “Cry Flames” deal in the kind of soaring hooks and basement low-end that might very well leave permanent marks on your home stereo. As the album draws into it’s closing few tracks, skittish hooks and warm textures sweep in and out of focus without ever losing the warped narrative that effectively joins Glass Swords into a startling cohesive whole. As an album, it’s one that doesn’t let up and demands repeat listens to fully appreciate the myriad hum-along melodies and wicked production u-turns, and don’t worry about the jittery over-caffeinated feeling you’ll have after listening…it’s to be expected.","<p>Glasgow’s talent pool clearly runs deep, and if the city’s last few years of genre-busting electronic music have made anything remotely clear it’s that Rustie is one of the deep-fried kingdom’s crown jewels.

They met in the indie band May or May Not, but after hearing mash-up DJs like Girl Talk and Them Jeans, they headed straight for the laptop and began combining Lil Wayne with Modest Mouse, Swizz Beatz with Deerhoof, and R. Kelly with Jens Lekman. Initial results were uploaded to the Hood Internet blog in 2007 and it didn’t take long for the music to explode. Right-click downloads quickly ticked into the thousands and by the end of the year New York Magazine had featured the band. The Hood Internet Mixtape, Vol. 1 also landed in 2007, while 2008’s mixtape The Hood Internet vs Chicago landed on some media year-end Top Ten lists, including Current TV’s. For music not released in any traditional format, it was a milestone, as it was in 2009 when the Ting Tings performed their song “Shut Up and Let Me Go” live with a bit of Estelle’s “American Boy” in the middle, a nod to the Hood Internet’s mash-up mix of the songs. In 2010 the group got some cool corporate sponsorship when the New York City streetwear brand Mishka sponsored their Trillwave mixtape. In 2012, the Hood Internet moved beyond the mash-up with their debut studio album, Feat.

But let’s get one thing straight, for the record: no more Wu-Tang requests, please! Both established DJs in Chicago prior to their alliance as Flosstradamus, J2K and Autobot initially linked up while DJing a house party together in 2005, decided to start performing as a duo, and the rest is history. Gathering vast influences from their respective backgrounds in punk and hip-hop, Flosstradamus brought normally divided crowds together with their unique mixes of Baltimore club, hip-hop, house, obscure remixes, and juke. A monthly party soon followed (“Get Outta The Hood”) at Chicago’s Town Hall Pub, and within a year Flosstradamus turned a stagnant bar into the proverbial place-to-be, lines stretching down the block while sweaty kids crowd surf and get down inside. National press soon began to take notice, with features in URB (“Next 100 for 2006”), MTV (featured in “My Block”), and The Fader. Other recent accolades of note include 2006 appearances at SXSW, CMJ, Pitchfork Festival, Pop Montreal, parties for VICE, The Fader, Jane Magazine, DKNY, URB, and Puma, not to mention performances with Clipse, Common, and Rick Ross. In the coming year, Flosstradamus plan to show off the rest of their multifaceted talent. Coming soon will be a full length Flosstradamus LP with J2K and Autobot on production duties, a mixtape with up and coming rappers The Cool Kids, and a European tour with A-Trak and Kid Sister.","<p>Flosstradamus, the oft-mentioned Chicago DJ duo comprised of J2K (Josh Young) and Autobot (Curt Cameruci) have been dominating the party scene nationwide with their tag-team DJ sets (3 turntables, 2 mixers) for years show no signs of slowing down.

Says drummer Billy, “The original, underlying concept of Unstoppable Death Machines was to be a space jam noise odyssey, infected with punk rock, rage, weed, beer, and more noise.” In that sense, their debut 7"" is a rousing success—four blown-out, bass-chuggin’ fuckitalls in seven damaging minutes (sample song titles: “Quit Your Whining And Shut Up,” “Head Trauma”) all etched to nasty little clear vinyl shard. The 7"" was recorded to two-inch tape in two days, and compiles four of the nine songs they played live with no overdubs, fueled (by their account) by lots of coffee and one giant joint. “Slumlord” is about exactly what you think it’s about.

They’d appeared on the Murfreesboro scene a decade earlier with an invigorating, quirky pop sound that lent itself to easy crowd participation with rowdy sing-alongs and whimsical handclaps. Immensely likable and talented, they were shoo-ins for local band most likely to succeed. So when news spread that the band were dropped in just under a year, fans were shocked. Sparking weeks of message-board rants and raves, the cause for the drop split their loyal following along the increasingly blurred line between art and commerce. The band had refused to cover a song for a commercial. The commercial? Chase Credit Cards. The song? The Beatles’ “All You Need Is Love.” From the cheap seats, it looked like the band might have shot themselves in the foot. In an age of MySpace, digital downloads and band branding, the formula for success is murkier than ever, and musicians are advised not to be too picky about who signs their paychecks. Artists must be shrewd businesspeople always looking for the next promotional opportunity, whether it’s ringtones, clothing lines or product endorsements, and commercial placement has both launched new careers and salvaged old ones. But The Features dug in their heels and opted not to take the money and run. Here’s why. It’s certainly a horror story we’ve heard before: band signs record deal, doesn’t get promoted. Label drops band for not selling enough records. In the music industry, success is a crapshoot. Lady luck gives with one hand and takes away with the other. Majors drop bands like most of us drop change in a tip jar, and they’ve practically turned career crushing into an art form. Just ask anybody courting label attention what it takes to score the elusive record deal, and they’ll give you a slew of contradictory messages about the equation for success. If you have great songs, you haven’t toured enough. Or if you’ve spanned the globe in a shitty van on a 3-dollar per diem, your image isn’t marketable. How’s your web presence these days? We don’t see that X factor. Or hey, you’re road warriors with great tunes and star appeal, but your songs don’t test well with the radio demographic. Maybe you’re over 25, or your live show’s not that exciting. Maybe they just don’t hear a single. That a band like The Features bypassed these roadblocks—they didn’t tour much, weren’t the types to stump for the cause and, after a decade together, hadn’t even released a full-length—is a feat in itself. Most bands never even get the deal. And the ones who do often talk of their stars aligning just right, as though some higher power were at hand. Though they’ve arguably had luck—songs with as much staying power as the fans they attract—it’s perseverance that has kept the band charging forward, through more than 10 years, two botched record deals, two lineup changes, three unreleased albums and two unexpected bundles of joy. The Features formed as middle-schoolers in Sparta, Tenn., a typically homogenous small Southern town about 15 miles outside of Cookeville that boasts bluegrass picker Lester Flatt as its musical calling card. The three original members—Matt Pelham on guitar and vocals, Don Sergio on guitar and Roger Dabbs on bass—came to Murfreesboro in the mid-’90s, where they met drummer Jason Taylor. Sergio brought friend and keyboardist Parrish Yaw on board, and they began playing their off-kilter pop with a slacker vibe, Hawaiian shirts and coordinated moves. Whereas most artists struggle to define their sound and attract a following, The Features never wanted for compelling songs, devout fans, industry attention or critical praise. They were an instant success at The Boro and Chameleon Café, long before the “The” bands had taken over, even before vintage keyboards and synthy waves made their resurgence. The darkly appealing Sergio was the heartthrob of the band, but Pelham’s shyness and introversion offstage in contrast to his possessed, kinetic live performances drew many a curious girl to the front of the crowd. So it wasn’t long before a new label in town came calling. Spongebath was the brainchild of former local Matt Mahaffey, along with veteran songsmith Seth Timbs and entrepreneur Richard Williams. The label’s roster included Mahaffey’s and Timbs’ groups—Self and Fluid Ounces—alongside acts like Gumption, The Roaries, The Katies and Count Bass D. Excitement buzzed around the hip new office in the ’Boro’s square, with its purple painted walls and ’70s pop-art logo. Fliers advertising Spongebath lineups—particularly those that included The Features—were guaranteed draws around town. Matt Meeks, who now co-manages The Features with Rory Daigle (both of whom did time at Spongebath during its heyday), remembers the first time he saw the band play, long before he knew them. “At first, I thought they were a Pavement ripoff,” Meeks says. “So I resisted liking them. Plus, at all their shows, there were always tons of girls up front fawning over them, just entranced. I was in a band at the time, and it made me not want to like them. But I ended up really liking them anyway.” There were four Features songs over two Spongebath samplers in 1998, Soaking in the Center of the Universe volumes I and II. But the first substantial introduction to the band was the previous year’s eponymous EP featuring the crowd favorite, “Armani Suede.” The track is a falsetto thrill with a jagged bounce that hinges on the slow burn from casual musing to frustrated explosion. Its love-obsessed subject matter would find its way into countless future songs. “Maybe she will / Maybe she won’t / Find what she’s looking for,” Pelham sings casually over a jaunty guitar riff and twinkling synth line. The jangle builds along a disco beat, then climaxes on the angry outburst, “I thought I knew / What you were going through / But I don’t!” Andy McLenon, who ran Nashville’s first indie rock label, Praxis, had since moved to a position as general manager at Spongebath. He’d heard about The Features through Williams. “He found The Features in a Pizza Hut,” McLenon says. “I don’t think that’s a legend—I think it’s true. I think they were still in high school. They were my favorite out of the batch. What I heard in them was like The Kinks. I heard the new Southern rock. That was part of what I did—I tried to figure out how to spin it. I know that sounds corny, but I thought that if The Kinks came to Sparta, they would sound like The Features.” Though the band technically came to Williams through Timbs, Williams did finalize Spongebath business with the band at a Pizza Hut. Myth aside, the band’s infectious live show confirmed McLenon’s suspicions. “I saw them live and they were so tight. I’d be thinking, if anybody saw this band they would see them as the premier band of the ’90s,” McLenon says. “My fantasy for them was that they’d define the new Southern rock. It used to bug them, ’cause they hated that phrase and at the time they didn’t like Southern rock. But to me it was just like the B-52s in Athens.” Despite the group’s inexperience with the industry machine, they were already showing early signs of what would become their reputation for staying tight-knit and tight-lipped about band affairs. “I’d never seen anything like them,” McLenon says. “They were so young, but they always seemed like they knew more than I knew about them. I could never figure them out, except that I knew they were great. If you had a meeting about something controversial—about something going on in their career at the time—they just stuck so together. You couldn’t separate them, no matter how much you tried. You’d leave not knowing. They’d never say, ‘This is what we think.’ They’d get all the information—this was so smart—they’d hear all your arguments and then say, ‘We need to talk about it.’ Then three days later you’d get their answer. This when they were nobodies. They were so tight.” But it wasn’t in the cards for Spongebath to make The Features a success. Self enjoyed premier status on the label, which wasn’t equipped to devote its meager resources beyond its star talent. The Features were stalled along with other acts on the roster like The Roaries and Fluid Ounces. “If we’d done things right, they’d have been huge,” McLenon says. “I felt they were ready way before they had the opportunity.” Not only had the band not been a priority at Spongebath, but they also produced three albums during that time that never saw the light of day. There’s speculation that Pelham’s insistence on perfection held up the records as much as the label’s inefficient handling of the band, which Pelham admits is partly true. “Part of that was the band, and part of that was Spongebath,” says Pelham, who speaks carefully and deliberately, and has the sort of thin, sensitive face and delicate features ideal for a Modigliani rendering. “It was mostly lack of confidence on Spongebath’s behalf. It seemed like they needed a band to break to have the money to put out a Features record. We recorded three records and none of them were this great thing that anyone thought would do something. It just ended up being this thing where I started second-guessing everything. You know—‘Is any of this really that good?’ I think that’s why some of that stuff never got released.” The band also lost two members over the stasis—Sergio and Taylor left in ’98—provoking its second setback. But it was a loss that soon proved fruitful. Rollum Haas assumed the sticks, and with a second guitarist gone from the band, Yaw’s circus whirl moved to the forefront, and Haas’ drumming—a maniacal beat that whips from trotting to hyperspeed on a dime—solidified the band’s sound. They no longer sounded like slackers, but like a tightly wound, adventurous pop band. With the new lineup, the band instead focused on singles, releasing the 10-inch “Thursday.” It’s a track that illustrates the band’s strengths, where musically sunny songs belie wistful lyrics and plangent frustration. It begins with a simple but propulsive pluck, the occasional guitar squiggle and swipe, and the yearning lyrics, “Thursday is the only day that I’ve been looking forward to / ’Cause Thursday is the only day that on my way I run into you.” Pelham’s voice shifts toward defeat on the next line, cracking into the whine, “I’ve been trying hard, I’ve been trying hard for a while / Change my walk, change my talk, change my hair, try to make you…smile.” The la-da-da-da’s kick in, overlapped by a drunken ya-da-da-da, before the song stomps off, headed for confrontation and chaos. It’s a scorned lover’s rebuke, but Pelham’s sweet frustration makes it sound harmless. If the band were finally ready to take a forward leap beyond local success, it would be now, with a solid lineup and a flawless batch of material. But there was another snag—or rather, two. Pelham learned his wife was pregnant, and he found himself the sole breadwinner of the family. 2001 brought an EP and a set of twin daughters. Recorded with local analog loyalist Brian Carter, the self-released The Beginning is a five-song tribute to impending fatherhood that shows the band alternately tender and fierce. But with newborns, extensive touring was suddenly impossible without substantial income for the band. Still, the songs cut through, and the EP was picked up two years later by UK label Fierce Panda, who had released singles from acts like Coldplay and Death Cab for Cutie. With that leverage, Daigle and Meeks began shopping it along with a three-song demo, which included the song “Blow It Out,” to various majors like Island, Atlantic, Warner Brothers and Universal. “We felt they were a major-label band,” says Meeks. “If they were at the right label, they could be successful at that level.” Universal bit. The A&R representative, Jolene Cherry, a former film music supervisor and head of the Cherry/Universal imprint, loved the band’s sound and worked up a one-year, two-option deal. That meant the band would release one record, giving the label the option to release the next two albums if they liked them, or release them from the terms if they didn’t. Along with the deal came an advance—six figures, according to Meeks—that gave the group enough money to make a record, tour and live for a year without day jobs. Out of all the labels they’d talked to, Universal seemed the most enthusiastic. “It came down to the excitement of the A&R person—her excitement for the band,” Pelham says. “She seemed to really have a genuine enthusiasm for what we were doing. But even with Universal, we wondered if it was the right thing for us, because they were mainly pop. They didn’t really have any rock records at the time.” Exhibit A was released on Sept. 14, 2004, in the States, the previous April in the UK. It’s a stunning 33-minute album that buzzes with addictive hooks and fervent pop gospel, and everything you’d expect from a debut that, in many ways, was some 10 years in the making. Search for press on the record, and you’ll have to dig just to find a lukewarm review. (One reviewer, referring to the lyrics of the single “Blow It Out,” remarks: “Ridiculous, expect it to be stuck in your head for days.”) But the album’s release was an early sign that the label wasn’t promoting the band as it should have been. “Before the record came out, there was pretty much no press and no publicity,” Pelham says. “But six months after the record came out, that’s when a press team really started working for us. And by that time, anyone at press had either already heard of us or said, ‘Well, this record’s been out for six months. It’s too late for us to write about it.’ It fell apart.” Though the label paid generously for the group to tour the UK a handful of times, most notably on a few runs with Kings of Leon, even those shows weren’t promoted. “We got really lucky with the Kings asking us out on the road,” Haas says. “But once again it seemed like the ducks weren’t in a row,” adds Pelham. “We would get there and there wouldn’t be promotion. It was really odd. The last tour we did with Kings of Leon—we heard at one point it was the biggest tour of the summer in the UK. We were the opening act for the biggest tour of the summer in the UK, and there was absolutely no press, no posters in the venues saying, ‘The Features, Exhibit A, Buy it now.’ ” The band received modest exposure for the track “Blow It Out,” notably a two-week run on CBS—but it wasn’t Universal who pushed the track to television. The CBS hookup was more serendipitous. An ad agency had heard the band and contacted them directly about using the song. The Features might have been more excited about potential exposure for their single, had they not been concerned with making a second record, which the label had already optioned. They’d sent demos to Cherry for consideration, with the answer that they should keep working on them. “The main time it started to go sour for me was when we were working on songs for the second record,” says Haas, who is the antithesis of Pelham’s quiet, reserved manner. He has a smiling, boyish face and speaks quickly with animated gesturing. “And it was the kind of thing where we were working very hard at it. Practicing a lot, trying to piece songs together and send them to our A&R person. Every time it was like, ‘No, this isn’t cutting it.’ That started to shake the confidence of the band.” Just as the deal with Spongebath left the band feeling like an afterthought, so did the deal with Universal. The record wasn’t selling well by industry standards—just over 12,000 copies in all were sold in the U.S., with UK sales thought to match that amount—and the single wasn’t getting the airplay the band or the label had hoped for. “The things I remember hearing were, ‘People at radio like it, but it doesn’t fit with what’s going on right now,’ ” Pelham says. “The Kaiser Chiefs had just been signed to Universal in the States, and their single ‘I Predict a Riot’ came out to radio when ‘Blow It Out’ did, and they said, ‘This is what’s big.’ I think all focus, if there was any focus on The Features, always seemed to get pushed to the backburner for something else—for another band. And that’s the way it is on a major. It’s sort of just priority. Just like on most labels.” With an ill-promoted record not exploding on radio, the label did what labels do. It sought to recoup its investment, and looked for a last-ditch effort to salvage the band’s career. All the band needed to do was cover a Beatles song for a Chase Credit Card commercial, put it on their second record and release it as a single. And not just any old Beatles song—one of the top Beatles songs of all time, used for the first worldwide televised broadcast in 1967: “All You Need Is Love.” It’s worth noting that The Beatles got their start playing covers. But all you need is love…and a 23-percent APR? It’s one of the least-covered Beatles songs due to its revered status, a flower-power anthem that espouses utopian ideals and astonishing optimism. It was incongruous to the band. “That Beatles song for that commercial feels really wrong to me,” says Haas. “As far as covering the song, whatever. If we were just to do that, cool. But using it for something like that seems wrong to me.” Not that the band were averse to putting a song in a commercial. “From the beginning it felt very wrong, the whole idea of it,” Pelham says. “If they had asked us to use one of our own songs, we would have considered it. But to ask us to cover a song without some sort of permission, especially ‘All You Need Is Love,’ seemed wrong.” And along with the request came pressure, the dangling carrot that the band’s career might be launched from this precarious move. “She [Cherry] said, ‘This is a great opportunity; it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,’ ” Pelham says. “ ‘This could potentially break the band. We put it on the record, it could be a single, and you can get the next record out.’ ” In their eyes, the label’s request showed a complete lack of confidence in the band. And not only did Universal need an answer, they needed it in an hour, with a finished song in two days. It’s not unusual for songs used in commercials to be turned around quickly—artists working on spec often churn out tracks in 24 hours to be considered for placement. But those are veterans, used to working under tight deadlines. The Features, used to working at their own pace, were understandably flustered. But far worse was the label’s response when the band admitted they didn’t think the cover was such a good idea. According to Pelham, the rep had already obligated the band to do the commercial, and when the band said they didn’t want to do it, Universal took a hard-line stance. The Features were two weeks away from entering the studio for their second record. “It’s so odd to wake up, get a phone call asking, ‘What do you think about this? Think about it for maybe 45 minutes to an hour,’ ” Pelham says. “Then being on the phone with the A&R person saying, ‘If you don’t do this, you’re gonna lose your record deal.’ We were so excited about going into the studio. Everything just completely changed.” If they’d had more time to discuss the cover, things might not have escalated within the band and become divisive to the point that keyboardist Parrish Yaw left the group. The band might not have shut down the message board on their site if the discussions of what the band should or shouldn’t have done hadn’t grown so heated. As Pelham puts it, “It was getting out of hand. People started taking it too seriously, and it was weird. We were just trying to figure out what happens next.” Pelham and Haas admit that despite the label’s botched efforts, they could have been better about promoting and networking—something they weren’t accustomed to in sleepy Murfreesboro, where they’d spent years honing their sound and perfecting their lineup. They have a certain childlike naïveté about the business, but it isn’t surprising. Pelham is a songwriter who finds joy in the little things—the monograms on his daughter’s clothes, the catharsis of a solitary jam session. It’s not that The Features aren’t smart guys or didn’t understand the consequences of their decision—it’s that they’ve never had to hustle for it. Their fans are as steady as they come, and it’s easy to see why a band in their favor would become complacent. This much they know. They’re intent on keeping the momentum going, even if that means dreaded networking. They’ve replaced Yaw with former De Novo Dahl keyboardist Mark Bond. All four band members are married, and Pelham of course has the twins to look after. But they’re getting used to thinking about video concepts and artwork for an EP, Contrast, that the band will self-release in September. And they will continue to seek a balance between their lives and their art. There’s talk of new label interest and showcases, but the band don’t want to discuss anything until it’s official. Meeks has even passed the torch of MySpace upkeep to Haas. Despite the experience with Universal, the band actually came out lucky—they were smart enough not to sign away their publishing. They aren’t sore toward major labels, and they realize compromise is necessary. To detractors who ranted on various forums about what they should or shouldn’t have done, Pelham and Haas are adamant that The Features made the right decision. “I think some people look at this like, ‘They had a deal, didn’t they know what that entails?’ ” Haas says. “But I think you still have to keep your integrity. You still have to do what feels right to you. Being on a major doesn’t mean doing whatever they ask and buckling to any pressure. “I’d like the band to be successful,” Haas continues. “I think that’d be really great. That’s a weird thing to say, though. I mean, I’d like the band to be successful, but I don’t know what it takes to do that exactly. What I have noticed is that historically, most bands that have been successful have had it together on every angle.” “I think there’s a lot of luck involved,” Pelham interjects. “We realize you have to ‘play ball,’ ” he adds, with an obvious distaste for the phrase. “Or make some sort of compromise, but I don’t think you should have to compromise….” “To that point I don’t think you should have to compromise,” Haas adds. “I think the band should be secondary to a lot of things we have going on sometimes,” says Pelham. “When we come home from work, we don’t want to go out or get on the Internet and start hyping the band, or go out and do public relations. Just because we want to spend time with our families. I guess if I had to choose, if someone told me, ‘You can’t be in this band unless you go out and network,’ I’d probably say, ‘OK, I guess I won’t be in the band.’ ” Meanwhile, the machine churns on. Nada Surf recorded the Beatles song, which you can currently hear on the Chase commercials airing on television. Online, fans of Nada Surf seem to like the cover, while critics shake their heads at the legacy of The Beatles being dragged through the muck in such a way. On a muggy Thursday night, Pelham and Haas are waiting around at Murfreesboro’s Grand Palace to sound check for their first show in months. The show, despite its secret status, packs the crowd into the cramped showroom and fills the hallway, so that necks must crane to catch a glimpse of the band. (A second secret show the following night at The Basement will sell out.) Despite no advertising and little air conditioning in the venue, the fans have still found their way to The Features, and their faces are old and new, with ages that range from 18 to 40-something. The band sound lean and mean onstage, although it could be that, with Bond on keys, Yaw’s two-fingered plunk and frenzied carnival organs have been replaced with a more formal subtlety. It moves the skeletal structure of the songs back into the foreground. The band debut new material that’s stronger than ever, like the glittery but pensive “Contrast.” “Look at what we have done / See the colors begin to fade,” Pelham croons in a soft warble. “Soon we’ll lose everyone / And they’ll only be shades of gray.” The song is meant to signal new beginnings. But its lyrics could be interpreted as a response to the controversy—that by holding true to their convictions, The Features have risked losing everything they have worked for, including making a career of playing music. A cynic might wonder whether anyone that naive belongs in the music industry, at a time when selling out is not a stigma but a strategic career move. But tonight, The Features are at home, before a crowd that will love them whether they sell 12,000 copies or shill for credit-card consumption. The band kick into a frenetic number called “Exorcising Demons,” and when it hits the chorus, “Demons / Be gone / Leave me alone tonight,” the crowd’s hands shoot up in the air with the beat, like a congregation testifying. Soon afterward, the show ends. And now The Features are about to learn whether love is really all you need. by Tracy Moore www.nashvillescene.com 2) The New Zealand post punk act who recorded two EP’s in the early 1980s.

The Features were stalled along with other acts on the roster like The Roaries and Fluid Ounces. “If we’d done things right, they’d have been huge,” McLenon says. “I felt they were ready way before they had the opportunity.” Not only had the band not been a priority at Spongebath, but they also produced three albums during that time that never saw the light of day. There’s speculation that Pelham’s insistence on perfection held up the records as much as the label’s inefficient handling of the band, which Pelham admits is partly true. “Part of that was the band, and part of that was Spongebath,” says Pelham, who speaks carefully and deliberately, and has the sort of thin, sensitive face and delicate features ideal for a Modigliani rendering. “It was mostly lack of confidence on Spongebath’s behalf. It seemed like they needed a band to break to have the money to put out a Features record. We recorded three records and none of them were this great thing that anyone thought would do something. It just ended up being this thing where I started second-guessing everything. You know—‘Is any of this really that good?’ I think that’s why some of that stuff never got released.” The band also lost two members over the stasis—Sergio and Taylor left in ’98—provoking its second setback. But it was a loss that soon proved fruitful. Rollum Haas assumed the sticks, and with a second guitarist gone from the band, Yaw’s circus whirl moved to the forefront, and Haas’ drumming—a maniacal beat that whips from trotting to hyperspeed on a dime—solidified the band’s sound. They no longer sounded like slackers, but like a tightly wound, adventurous pop band. With the new lineup, the band instead focused on singles, releasing the 10-inch “Thursday.” It’s a track that illustrates the band’s strengths, where musically sunny songs belie wistful lyrics and plangent frustration. It begins with a simple but propulsive pluck, the occasional guitar squiggle and swipe, and the yearning lyrics, “Thursday is the only day that I’ve been looking forward to / ’Cause Thursday is the only day that on my way I run into you.” Pelham’s voice shifts toward defeat on the next line, cracking into the whine, “I’ve been trying hard, I’ve been trying hard for a while / Change my walk, change my talk, change my hair, try to make you…smile.” The la-da-da-da’s kick in, overlapped by a drunken ya-da-da-da, before the song stomps off, headed for confrontation and chaos. It’s a scorned lover’s rebuke, but Pelham’s sweet frustration makes it sound harmless. If the band were finally ready to take a forward leap beyond local success, it would be now, with a solid lineup and a flawless batch of material. But there was another snag—or rather, two. Pelham learned his wife was pregnant, and he found himself the sole breadwinner of the family. 2001 brought an EP and a set of twin daughters. Recorded with local analog loyalist Brian Carter, the self-released The Beginning is a five-song tribute to impending fatherhood that shows the band alternately tender and fierce. But with newborns, extensive touring was suddenly impossible without substantial income for the band. Still, the songs cut through, and the EP was picked up two years later by UK label Fierce Panda, who had released singles from acts like Coldplay and Death Cab for Cutie. With that leverage, Daigle and Meeks began shopping it along with a three-song demo, which included the song “Blow It Out,” to various majors like Island, Atlantic, Warner Brothers and Universal. “We felt they were a major-label band,” says Meeks. “If they were at the right label, they could be successful at that level.” Universal bit. The A&R representative, Jolene Cherry, a former film music supervisor and head of the Cherry/Universal imprint, loved the band’s sound and worked up a one-year, two-option deal. That meant the band would release one record, giving the label the option to release the next two albums if they liked them, or release them from the terms if they didn’t. Along with the deal came an advance—six figures, according to Meeks—that gave the group enough money to make a record, tour and live for a year without day jobs. Out of all the labels they’d talked to, Universal seemed the most enthusiastic. “It came down to the excitement of the A&R person—her excitement for the band,” Pelham says. “She seemed to really have a genuine enthusiasm for what we were doing. But even with Universal, we wondered if it was the right thing for us, because they were mainly pop. They didn’t really have any rock records at the time.” Exhibit A was released on Sept. 14, 2004, in the States, the previous April in the UK. It’s a stunning 33-minute album that buzzes with addictive hooks and fervent pop gospel, and everything you’d expect from a debut that, in many ways, was some 10 years in the making. Search for press on the record, and you’ll have to dig just to find a lukewarm review. (One reviewer, referring to the lyrics of the single “Blow It Out,” remarks: “Ridiculous, expect it to be stuck in your head for days.”) But the album’s release was an early sign that the label wasn’t promoting the band as it should have been. “Before the record came out, there was pretty much no press and no publicity,” Pelham says. “But six months after the record came out, that’s when a press team really started working for us. And by that time, anyone at press had either already heard of us or said, ‘Well, this record’s been out for six months. It’s too late for us to write about it.’ It fell apart.” Though the label paid generously for the group to tour the UK a handful of times, most notably on a few runs with Kings of Leon, even those shows weren’t promoted. “We got really lucky with the Kings asking us out on the road,” Haas says. “But once again it seemed like the ducks weren’t in a row,” adds Pelham. “We would get there and there wouldn’t be promotion. It was really odd. The last tour we did with Kings of Leon—we heard at one point it was the biggest tour of the summer in the UK. We were the opening act for the biggest tour of the summer in the UK, and there was absolutely no press, no posters in the venues saying, ‘The Features, Exhibit A, Buy it now.’ ” The band received modest exposure for the track “Blow It Out,” notably a two-week run on CBS—but it wasn’t Universal who pushed the track to television. The <span class=""caps"">CBS</span> hookup was more serendipitous. An ad agency had heard the band and contacted them directly about using the song. The Features might have been more excited about potential exposure for their single, had they not been concerned with making a second record, which the label had already optioned. They’d sent demos to Cherry for consideration, with the answer that they should keep working on them. “The main time it started to go sour for me was when we were working on songs for the second record,” says Haas, who is the antithesis of Pelham’s quiet, reserved manner. He has a smiling, boyish face and speaks quickly with animated gesturing. “And it was the kind of thing where we were working very hard at it. Practicing a lot, trying to piece songs together and send them to our A&R person. Every time it was like, ‘No, this isn’t cutting it.’ That started to shake the confidence of the band.” Just as the deal with Spongebath left the band feeling like an afterthought, so did the deal with Universal. The record wasn’t selling well by industry standards—just over 12,000 copies in all were sold in the U.S., with UK sales thought to match that amount—and the single wasn’t getting the airplay the band or the label had hoped for. “The things I remember hearing were, ‘People at radio like it, but it doesn’t fit with what’s going on right now,’ ” Pelham says. “The Kaiser Chiefs had just been signed to Universal in the States, and their single ‘I Predict a Riot’ came out to radio when ‘Blow It Out’ did, and they said, ‘This is what’s big.’ I think all focus, if there was any focus on The Features, always seemed to get pushed to the backburner for something else—for another band. And that’s the way it is on a major. It’s sort of just priority. Just like on most labels.” With an ill-promoted record not exploding on radio, the label did what labels do. It sought to recoup its investment, and looked for a last-ditch effort to salvage the band’s career. All the band needed to do was cover a Beatles song for a Chase Credit Card commercial, put it on their second record and release it as a single. And not just any old Beatles song—one of the top Beatles songs of all time, used for the first worldwide televised broadcast in 1967: “All You Need Is Love.” It’s worth noting that The Beatles got their start playing covers. But all you need is love…and a 23-percent <span class=""caps"">APR</span>? It’s one of the least-covered Beatles songs due to its revered status, a flower-power anthem that espouses utopian ideals and astonishing optimism. It was incongruous to the band. “That Beatles song for that commercial feels really wrong to me,” says Haas. “As far as covering the song, whatever. If we were just to do that, cool. But using it for something like that seems wrong to me.” Not that the band were averse to putting a song in a commercial. “From the beginning it felt very wrong, the whole idea of it,” Pelham says. “If they had asked us to use one of our own songs, we would have considered it. But to ask us to cover a song without some sort of permission, especially ‘All You Need Is Love,’ seemed wrong.” And along with the request came pressure, the dangling carrot that the band’s career might be launched from this precarious move. “She [Cherry] said, ‘This is a great opportunity; it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,’ ” Pelham says. “ ‘This could potentially break the band. We put it on the record, it could be a single, and you can get the next record out.’ ” In their eyes, the label’s request showed a complete lack of confidence in the band. And not only did Universal need an answer, they needed it in an hour, with a finished song in two days. It’s not unusual for songs used in commercials to be turned around quickly—artists working on spec often churn out tracks in 24 hours to be considered for placement. But those are veterans, used to working under tight deadlines. The Features, used to working at their own pace, were understandably flustered. But far worse was the label’s response when the band admitted they didn’t think the cover was such a good idea. According to Pelham, the rep had already obligated the band to do the commercial, and when the band said they didn’t want to do it, Universal took a hard-line stance. The Features were two weeks away from entering the studio for their second record. “It’s so odd to wake up, get a phone call asking, ‘What do you think about this? Think about it for maybe 45 minutes to an hour,’ ” Pelham says. “Then being on the phone with the A&R person saying, ‘If you don’t do this, you’re gonna lose your record deal.’ We were so excited about going into the studio. Everything just completely changed.” If they’d had more time to discuss the cover, things might not have escalated within the band and become divisive to the point that keyboardist Parrish Yaw left the group. The band might not have shut down the message board on their site if the discussions of what the band should or shouldn’t have done hadn’t grown so heated. As Pelham puts it, “It was getting out of hand. People started taking it too seriously, and it was weird. We were just trying to figure out what happens next.” Pelham and Haas admit that despite the label’s botched efforts, they could have been better about promoting and networking—something they weren’t accustomed to in sleepy Murfreesboro, where they’d spent years honing their sound and perfecting their lineup. They have a certain childlike naïveté about the business, but it isn’t surprising. Pelham is a songwriter who finds joy in the little things—the monograms on his daughter’s clothes, the catharsis of a solitary jam session. It’s not that The Features aren’t smart guys or didn’t understand the consequences of their decision—it’s that they’ve never had to hustle for it. Their fans are as steady as they come, and it’s easy to see why a band in their favor would become complacent. This much they know. They’re intent on keeping the momentum going, even if that means dreaded networking. They’ve replaced Yaw with former De Novo Dahl keyboardist Mark Bond. All four band members are married, and Pelham of course has the twins to look after. But they’re getting used to thinking about video concepts and artwork for an EP, Contrast, that the band will self-release in September. And they will continue to seek a balance between their lives and their art. There’s talk of new label interest and showcases, but the band don’t want to discuss anything until it’s official. Meeks has even passed the torch of MySpace upkeep to Haas. Despite the experience with Universal, the band actually came out lucky—they were smart enough not to sign away their publishing. They aren’t sore toward major labels, and they realize compromise is necessary. To detractors who ranted on various forums about what they should or shouldn’t have done, Pelham and Haas are adamant that The Features made the right decision. “I think some people look at this like, ‘They had a deal, didn’t they know what that entails?’ ” Haas says. “But I think you still have to keep your integrity. You still have to do what feels right to you. Being on a major doesn’t mean doing whatever they ask and buckling to any pressure. “I’d like the band to be successful,” Haas continues. “I think that’d be really great. That’s a weird thing to say, though. I mean, I’d like the band to be successful, but I don’t know what it takes to do that exactly. What I have noticed is that historically, most bands that have been successful have had it together on every angle.” “I think there’s a lot of luck involved,” Pelham interjects. “We realize you have to ‘play ball,’ ” he adds, with an obvious distaste for the phrase. “Or make some sort of compromise, but I don’t think you should have to compromise….” “To that point I don’t think you should have to compromise,” Haas adds. “I think the band should be secondary to a lot of things we have going on sometimes,” says Pelham. “When we come home from work, we don’t want to go out or get on the Internet and start hyping the band, or go out and do public relations. Just because we want to spend time with our families. I guess if I had to choose, if someone told me, ‘You can’t be in this band unless you go out and network,’ I’d probably say, ‘OK, I guess I won’t be in the band.’ ” Meanwhile, the machine churns on. Nada Surf recorded the Beatles song, which you can currently hear on the Chase commercials airing on television. Online, fans of Nada Surf seem to like the cover, while critics shake their heads at the legacy of The Beatles being dragged through the muck in such a way. On a muggy Thursday night, Pelham and Haas are waiting around at Murfreesboro’s Grand Palace to sound check for their first show in months. The show, despite its secret status, packs the crowd into the cramped showroom and fills the hallway, so that necks must crane to catch a glimpse of the band. (A second secret show the following night at The Basement will sell out.) Despite no advertising and little air conditioning in the venue, the fans have still found their way to The Features, and their faces are old and new, with ages that range from 18 to 40-something. The band sound lean and mean onstage, although it could be that, with Bond on keys, Yaw’s two-fingered plunk and frenzied carnival organs have been replaced with a more formal subtlety. It moves the skeletal structure of the songs back into the foreground. The band debut new material that’s stronger than ever, like the glittery but pensive “Contrast.” “Look at what we have done / See the colors begin to fade,” Pelham croons in a soft warble. “Soon we’ll lose everyone / And they’ll only be shades of gray.” The song is meant to signal new beginnings. But its lyrics could be interpreted as a response to the controversy—that by holding true to their convictions, The Features have risked losing everything they have worked for, including making a career of playing music. A cynic might wonder whether anyone that naive belongs in the music industry, at a time when selling out is not a stigma but a strategic career move. But tonight, The Features are at home, before a crowd that will love them whether they sell 12,000 copies or shill for credit-card consumption. The band kick into a frenetic number called “Exorcising Demons,” and when it hits the chorus, “Demons / Be gone / Leave me alone tonight,” the crowd’s hands shoot up in the air with the beat, like a congregation testifying. Soon afterward, the show ends. And now The Features are about to learn whether love is really all you need. by Tracy Moore <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nashvillescene.com"">www.nashvillescene.com</a> 2) The New Zealand post punk act who recorded two EP’s in the early 1980s.

That he did throughout the ’70s, becoming a fixture in the Village folk and rock scenes and getting tabbed as the next big thing to come out of that long-thriving artistic community. Writing in The New York Times, the great rock critic Robert Palmer called him “one of the most gifted singer-songwriters to emerge from the New York scene in years.” He made his recording debut in 1980 with his acclaimed self-titled LP on Arista Records, following it a year later with Golden Down. He also opened the Who’s North American tour at the personal request of the band. In 1982, he signed to Geffen Records but got caught in record-biz limbo and didn’t manage to release another record until 1991, when Columbia issued Places I Have Never Been. With the EP Hard Times in America in 1992, which became a cult favorite throughout Europe, Nile finally managed to jump off the major-label hamster wheel. Gathering together his resources over time, he managed to put out his first self-released album, Beautiful Wreck of the World in 1999.

Scheduled for release June 9 on Bar/None Records, it features Branford Marsalis on two tracks: the single “Early in the Morning” and Peter’s ode to New Orleans, “Begin Again.” Drum aces Jon Wurster (Superchunk, Son Volt, Bob Mould, the Mountain Goats), Logan Matheny (Roman Candle, The Rosebuds), and percussionist Gary Greene (Hootie and the Blowfish, Big Head Todd and the Monsters) bring power to tracks such as “Some of the Parts” and “Widescreen World”, and the dB’s’ rhythm section Gene Holder and Will Rigby join in on the atmospheric “Santa Monica.” The acoustic side of the duo, reminiscent of their 1992 RNA album “Mavericks,” comes to the fore on tracks such as “Long Time Coming,” one of several that feature Greg Readling (Chatham County Line, Tift Merritt) on pedal steel. The lead track, “My Friend the Sun,” is a cover of a classic from the legendary British prog-pop band Family. Peter and Chris grew up together in Winston-Salem, NC, and started playing music together in middle school—and have really never stopped. Through countless bands along the way—including Rittenhouse Square, Little Diesel, Sneakers, the H-Bombs, the dB’s, Continental Drifters, the Golden Palominos—and recording sessions and sideman stints with the likes of R.E.M., Bob Mould and Hootie and the Blowfish, the two have maintained a deep musical connection. They both are proficient at most string and keyboard instruments, and neither is much good at winds!

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-silos","The Silos","New York NY","","In 1985, when vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Walter Salas-Humara recorded a handful of tunes with the help of a dozen and a half friends and collected the songs under the title About Her Steps, he probably wasn’t thinking that it was the start of a career in music that’s now approaching 20 years and still going strong. No, at that point, he was too busy thinking about, among other things, names. ""In the beginning, I didn’t want to use my name because I thought it was too hard for people to deal with,"" explains Salas-Humara when discussing the origin of the Silos name. ""So I came up with a name that was two syllables, easy to roll of the tongue, and works in all languages more or less."" With a name in hand, as well as some (in his words) ""unexpected interest"" in About Her Steps, Salas-Humara put together a touring band. That line-up made Cuba, originally released in 1987, an exhilarating album that introduced the Silos’ enviable ability to communicate effectively in both a whisper and a howl. Cuba attracted national attention. The video for ""Tennessee Fire"" was played by MTV and the band was voted ""Best New American Band"" by the Rolling Stone critic’s poll. The band subsequently signed to RCA Records and the third album under the Silos name (self-titled, but often conveniently referred to as The One With The Bird On The Cover) was even better and led to an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. Its spacious, organic quality made it seem out of place in 1990; however, looking back at the album from within the Alternative-Indy glow of the decade’s end, The Silos resonates like the work of visionaries. Since that landmark album, Salas-Humara has kept the Silos name alive with a continuing series of impassioned recordings and miles and miles of roadwork. Four Silos studio albums, Hasta La Victoria (1992) and Susan Across The Ocean (1994), Heater (1998). Laser Beam Next Door (2001), and When The Telephone Rings (2004) followed. The latest album, Come On Like The Fast Lane, is their most accomplished to date, mixing primitive rock, edgy psychedelia and down-home organic soul without reservation. Salas-Humara has also released several solo albums, produced several others for such kindred spirits as Michael Hall and Jim Roll, was a founding member of the seminal soul/drone band The Vulgar Boatmen, did some guest drumming on Hazeldine’s Orphans, and joined Hall and Alejandro Escovedo in a two-off named The Setters. Ira Robbins, writing in The Trouser Press Record Guide, describes Salas-Humara as an ""unflashy auteur whose alt-rock amalgam drapes country, punk, baroque stateliness and pop in an abiding sadness."" When you look at Salas-Humara’s wide-ranging career and his dedication to the art of songwriting, it’s definitely not a stretch to include his name alongside the likes of Escovedo, REM, Lucinda Williams, Stephen Malkmus, and Neil Young. These days, Salas-Humara is enjoying the stability of a Silos line-up that’s been together longer than any other, closing in on nine years, with Drew Glackin on bass and lap steel and Konrad Meissner on drums. ""We all enjoy each other’s company quite a bit"" is Salas-Humara’s take on this longevity. ""And stylistically, it all locks together in an interesting way. Visceral guitar playing combined with very melodic bass work and eclectic drumming works in a trio format. And to have the steel guitar (courtesy of Glackin) on the quieter songs adds a whole other dimension."" The Silos create a sound that’s hard to pin down. According to Buzz McClain in The Washington Post, the band creates ""powerful earthy pop that sounds like the result of Nirvana riding on R.E.M.‘s tour bus."" ""The band’s austere style inflects the astringent twang of The Velvet Underground with the drone of R.E.M. and adds countryish echoes that recall Gram Parsons,"" offered Stephen Holden in The New York Times. ""We get compared to everybody,"" says Salas-Humara. ""To some people, we’re a country band. To other people, we’re a rock band. To other people, we’re an acoustic band. Some people think we’re rootsy, and others think we’re arty."" He pauses to take a breath and to chuckle at the breadth of it all. ""We’re all of those things."" Yes, every one of those descriptions is accurate, a snapshot of the truth taken from a different angle. The music of Salas-Humara and his bandmates is the sound of ideas, styles, and maybe even cultures colliding. It deftly combines a big beat with a nothing-wasted leanness, and it’s music that possesses a unique blending of intensity and approachability, with the ferocious rockers tilting you back on your heels just as quickly as the hushed, tightly coiled ballads draw you closer. So how should one sum up the music of the Silos? With a new album on the shelves and a trail of memorable shows (from performances in large music halls to intimate house concerts) both behind them and in front of them, let’s just call it enduring.

He’s been inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame three times, in 2000 as a solo artist, in 2008 as a member of the Skunks, and in 2009 as a member of the True Believers. In 2006, the readers of the Austin Chronicle named him Austin Musician of the Year. In 2008, Graham was the subject of a portrait-of-the-artist documentary, Swept Away, which is available nationally on DVD. In its final issue, No Depression magazine called the film, “superb.” Shortly after the films release in the Spring of 2008, Graham survived a one car crash on Texas’ I-35 that claimed his spleen, left him with a zipper scar up his chest, and permanently wreaked havoc on his back and neck. Despite a massive hospital bill – or perhaps because of it – Graham was back at work about one month later at his beloved Continental Club in Austin. He’s barely slowed down since, finding time to write and record a new album – his first studio record since 2006 — and making time to develop a new weekly live residency, Jon Dee and Friend, — whose guests have included Kelly Willis, Alejandro Escovedo, James McMurtry, & Curt Kirkwood amongst others. It’s Not As Bad As it Looks, Graham’s 2010 release is about — you guessed it – second chances, hope, sin & redemption, the constant search for higher meaning and a path forward, and trying to walk that fine line life often forces upon you. And it’s all delivered through Jon Dee Graham’s unique prism of pointed lyrics, searing guitar, and arrangements that sway between touching ballads and balls out rock with a punk edge. “I know this is loaded and I am way too close to it” Graham says, “but I think it’s my best record since my first one, Escape From Monster Island.” It’s Not As Bad As It Looks was recorded at Austin’s Wire Recording with Stuart Sullivan at the helm. Graham produced with his long-time musical partner and cohort, Mike Hardwick. Another stalwart compadre, Andrew Duplantis, of Son Volt, was on bass.

McMurtry, along with his Austin-based band, James McMurtry & The Heartless Bastards, is a self-described “rock & roots” guitarist and singer-songwriter, drawing on elements of alt-country, folk and old-fashioned texas rock. The son of novelist Larry McMurtry, James was born in Fort Worth, Texas in 1962, and grew up in Virginia. James McMurtry’s seventh studio album, Childish Things, was released on Compadre Records in the fall of 2005. As writer L.E.Brady notes, ""The album includes McMurtry’s statement on American decline – We Can’t Make It Here – his most unabashedly political number yet."" Just Us Kids— released in 2008, is McMurtry’s ninth full-length album. While he insists that “the majority of the songs are not political,” it’s also clear that he’s not even close to abandoning his burgeoning role as a searing political gadfly. The core band throughout is McMurtry on guitar, his longtime road band The Heartless Bastards (bassist Ronnie Johnson and drummer Daren Hess) and “guest Bastard” Ian McLagan (The Faces) on keys. So, roll over Kate Smith — this “God Bless America (pat mAcdonald Must Die)” bears no resemblance to the ubiquitous Irving Berlin chest-thumper; it’s a scorched-earth cataloging of the old-boys’ club glad-handing, cronyism and “belly up to the trough” feeding-frenzy of corporate and state war profiteers. “Cheney’s Toy” juxtaposes the Hollywood hubris of the Bush administration against images of Guantanamo and a brain-damaged U.S. veteran. “The Governor” probes the roles of class and wealth in the solving and prosecution of crimes, and “Ruins of the Realm” sorts through the fallout and detritus of a cynical, unilateral approach to global “mapping.” “Ruby and Carlos” looks at a relationship eroded by miscommunication and conflicting ambitions (with Gulf War Syndrome further roiling the waters). Ruby and Carlos aren’t doomed by a single fatal flaw; instead, their love is exhausted by a series of minor disconnects, finally dying the death of a thousand cuts. “Fire Line Road” looks at incest and meth addiction as the normal, everyday, ghastly horrors that they are — exposing some of the ugliest dirt we’ve always swept under our societal rug. “Freeway View” is a honking, breakaway rock ’n’ roller propelled by Ian McLagan’s dazzling ivory-tickling while, according to James, the Dylanesque “Hurricane Party” inhabits “an old man cussing himself for what he misses and what he missed, occasionally noticing what’s happening now — it’s a reminiscence at the end of the world.” The moving set-closer “You’d a’ Thought (Leonard Cohen Must Die)” imbues its tale of a couple strained by individual weaknesses and stubborn old habits with a generosity of spirit and wry resignation. McMurtry says the parenthetical tag is there because “the lyrics kinda reminded me of a Cohen song, and I was still writing it while we were supposed to be recording it, and it just went on and on. So when I finally came up with it, I said ‘If it wasn’t for Leonard Cohen, you wouldn’t have had to spend half the day waiting on me.’” Listen at Last.fmWatch videos of James McMurtry playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!","<p><strong>James L.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/chelle-rose","Chelle Rose","LOUDON COUNTY TENNESSEE","country","CHELLE ROSE’S GHOST OF BROWDER HOLLER MEETS AT THE INTERSECTION OF APPALACHIAN ROCK AND COUNTRY Ray Wylie Hubbard-produced second album due out May 1, 2012 NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Hardscrabble Appalachia is known for its bluegrass, moonshine and coal mines. Now, with the May 1 arrival of gut-honest singer-songwriter Chelle Rose’s second album Ghost of Browder Holler (Lil’ Damsel Records, street date May 1, 2012), add visceral rock ’n’ roll to that list. Rose brings her elemental power to the 12-song disc produced by legendary Texas songsmith Ray Wylie Hubbard in Austin. And while those cuts, ripe with mystery and passion, sound like they were plucked from the kudzu-scented air of her native Loudon County in East Tennessee, they’re really written from life. “When I get homesick, I pine for Western North Carolina sometimes even more so than East Tennessee,” says Rose, who moved to Nashville in 1996. “My maternal family lives on both sides of the Smoky Mountains. I grew up there among the people I still know and love. I’ve always felt connected and consoled by the mountains and my people there, so writing about them comes very natural to me. There are many settings and characters rich for the mining.” The album’s opening track, “Browder Holler Boy,” is a perfect example. It kick-starts the set with a haunting slide guitar invocation and then spins a true tale of Rose’s first love, Timothy Andrew Helton, who died young in a canoeing accident, but returned to visit her as a noisy spirit. The tune also features Hubbard’s gritty supporting vocals and laid back harmonica. The heart of Rose’s close-to-the-bone sound — a driving approach she calls “Appalachian Rock n Roll” — thumps through the grinding, guitar-fueled “Alimony,” a playful but dead-serious account of the marriage she ended in order to attain her dream of becoming a songwriter and performer. There’s more than a hint of Exile on Main Street to “Rufus Morgan (Preacher Man),” which features legendary Faces keyboardist Ian “Mac” McLagan and Nashville’s leading spiritual singing family the McCrary Sisters. Rose wrote the song as a tribute to a rural holy man from her family tree, and its lyrics are a virtual tour of Western North Carolina’s richly forested land, where her “grannymom” often took her to visit other family members during childhood summers. Like the sweet and gravelly edges of Rose’s expressive voice, other songs echo the beauty and harshness of Appalachian life. “Leona Barnett,” written by her fellow East Tennessean Adam Hill, is the story of a woman driven to work in the mines after her husband is killed in a mining accident. And “Wild Violets Pretty,” which features Grammy-nominated Americana star Elizabeth Cook as guest vocalist, is about losing an unborn child. “Sometimes I can’t perform a song live until I’ve had time to heal from a deep wound, and often the healing begins with the song,” explains Rose. “I write a lot and don’t really look for material, so you know if I’m covering someone else’s song I am feeling it with every ounce of my soul.” Although this Appalachian wildflower didn’t get her first guitar until she was 25, music was always a deep part of her life. “My daddy was a piano player and so was his daddy,” she relates. Sherri King, her biological father’s first cousin, had some minor country hits in the ’70s, but had the distinction of writing, singing and playing on her own recordings — which made her a rare triple threat in Nashville’s good ole boys club. She was also a member of the legendary group Barefoot Jerry, a band of player’s players, and was a featured vocalist with Charlie McCoy’s band. “One of my first musical memories was sitting on my Granny Rose’s floor listening to Sherri’s second album and just running the needle over and over it,” she recalls. “I’d always sung and thought about maybe singing on a stage some day, but getting that guitar really woke something up in me,” Rose recounts. “I started listening to songwriters like Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Townes Van Zandt and my gut told me I was most likely not going to continue working in accounting.” So Rose relocated to Nashville in 1996 where she began seeing her inspirations in person. “As soon as I arrived I began ‘going to school’ to hear Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Buddy Miller, Malcolm Holcombe, R.B. Morris, David Olney and Marshall Chapman. They were just a few of my favorites and some of them have become friends and mentors. “When I moved from Knoxville to Nashville, Townes Van Zandt was at the top of my dream list of songwriters to hear live. I was devastated to hear of his passing in January 1997. I did however sit on a back church pew at his service, sad with regret that I would never get to hang with him. He played a huge part in my journey to become a songwriter.” Rose’s next step was making her debut recording. “Being at home and writing Nanahally River in the late ’90s with a baby on my hip seemed completely natural and just as important as the deep well of writers I was exposed to on the music scene at that time,” she says. Along with her mentor and musical kindred spirit David Hardman, Rose made her 2000 album Nanahally River in a basement studio. “Recording [it] was really casual with a lot of friends helping me out,” she says. “I paid J.D. Wilkes from the Legendary Shack*Shakers to play harmonica on Nanahally River by cooking him chicken n dumplins. I like to think that added to the magic.” Fast-forward 10 years. “More than a decade passed between albums because I was busy raising a family, but always writing when inspiration struck,” Rose continues. “I’ve never just sat down with a goal of writing a song. They just show up and I document them the best I can. Fate interceded in early fall of 2010 when I was snuggling with my daughter and had headphones on listening to Ray Wylie Hubbard do a live interview for Twisted South Radio. They asked him what he’d been listening to lately. He said, ‘Well, I’ve been listening to this songwriter from Nashville named Chelle Rose.’ I bolted up from the bed and heard him say he’d be interested in producing me. And the host, Zeke Loftin, who I had collaborated with on a charity event, said, ‘Chelle, if you’re listening you should call in.’ So I did, and I said, ‘You’re hired, let’s do it.’ A few weeks later I was off to Austin with my guitar and songs.” For Ghost of Browder Holler, Hubbard handpicked the players, who convened at engineer/bassist George Reiff’s Austin studio. “Every morning we’d sit at the kitchen table and pull one of my songs out of the hat,” Rose says. “Then we’d work out an arrangement and either agree or disagree to cut it. It was a beautiful, intense process that resulted in a record I’m so proud of.” That spontaneous approach — and the band playing all the basic tracks together in the studio — helped preserve the disc’s cohesive live vibe. “What’s in the tracks is some hard core blood, sweat and tears from myself and many talented musicians who were generous with their contributions to the arrangements and to the soul of this album,” Rose declares. “I tried to quit music, but it just wouldn’t quit me. I realized I need it like I need food, water, sleep and love. It’s not about chasing fame or any kind of fortune. It’s about a strong connection with who I am. I share my music because it creates a beautiful exchange of energy in my life. It most certainly is medicine for my own soul. If it has the same effect on others, then I’m blessed.” ### For more information about Chelle Rose, please contact Conqueroo: Cary Baker • (323) 656-1600 • cary@conqueroo.com","<p><span class=""caps"">CHELLE</span> ROSE’S <span class=""caps"">GHOST</span> OF <span class=""caps"">BROWDER</span> <span class=""caps"">HOLLER</span> <span class=""caps"">MEETS</span> AT <span class=""caps"">THE</span> <span class=""caps"">INTERSECTION</span> OF <span class=""caps"">APPALACHIAN</span> <span class=""caps"">ROCK</span> <span class=""caps"">AND</span> <span class=""caps"">COUNTRY</span></p> <p>Ray Wylie Hubbard-produced second album due out May 1, 2012</p> <p><span class=""caps"">NASHVILLE</span>, Tenn. – Hardscrabble Appalachia is known for its bluegrass, moonshine and coal mines.

The tune also features Hubbard’s gritty supporting vocals and laid back harmonica. The heart of Rose’s close-to-the-bone sound — a driving approach she calls “Appalachian Rock n Roll” — thumps through the grinding, guitar-fueled “Alimony,” a playful but dead-serious account of the marriage she ended in order to attain her dream of becoming a songwriter and performer. There’s more than a hint of Exile on Main Street to “Rufus Morgan (Preacher Man),” which features legendary Faces keyboardist Ian “Mac” McLagan and Nashville’s leading spiritual singing family the McCrary Sisters. Rose wrote the song as a tribute to a rural holy man from her family tree, and its lyrics are a virtual tour of Western North Carolina’s richly forested land, where her “grannymom” often took her to visit other family members during childhood summers.</p> <p>Like the sweet and gravelly edges of Rose’s expressive voice, other songs echo the beauty and harshness of Appalachian life. “Leona Barnett,” written by her fellow East Tennessean Adam Hill, is the story of a woman driven to work in the mines after her husband is killed in a mining accident. And “Wild Violets Pretty,” which features Grammy-nominated Americana star Elizabeth Cook as guest vocalist, is about losing an unborn child.</p> <p>“Sometimes I can’t perform a song live until I’ve had time to heal from a deep wound, and often the healing begins with the song,” explains Rose. “I write a lot and don’t really look for material, so you know if I’m covering someone else’s song I am feeling it with every ounce of my soul.”</p> <p>Although this Appalachian wildflower didn’t get her first guitar until she was 25, music was always a deep part of her life. “My daddy was a piano player and so was his daddy,” she relates. Sherri King, her biological father’s first cousin, had some minor country hits in the ’70s, but had the distinction of writing, singing and playing on her own recordings — which made her a rare triple threat in Nashville’s good ole boys club. She was also a member of the legendary group Barefoot Jerry, a band of player’s players, and was a featured vocalist with Charlie McCoy’s band. “One of my first musical memories was sitting on my Granny Rose’s floor listening to Sherri’s second album and just running the needle over and over it,” she recalls.</p> <p>“I’d always sung and thought about maybe singing on a stage some day, but getting that guitar really woke something up in me,” Rose recounts. “I started listening to songwriters like Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Townes Van Zandt and my gut told me I was most likely not going to continue working in accounting.”</p> <p>So Rose relocated to Nashville in 1996 where she began seeing her inspirations in person. “As soon as I arrived I began ‘going to school’ to hear Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Buddy Miller, Malcolm Holcombe, R.B. Morris, David Olney and Marshall Chapman. They were just a few of my favorites and some of them have become friends and mentors.</p> <p>“When I moved from Knoxville to Nashville, Townes Van Zandt was at the top of my dream list of songwriters to hear live. I was devastated to hear of his passing in January 1997. I did however sit on a back church pew at his service, sad with regret that I would never get to hang with him. He played a huge part in my journey to become a songwriter.”</p> <p>Rose’s next step was making her debut recording. “Being at home and writing Nanahally River in the late ’90s with a baby on my hip seemed completely natural and just as important as the deep well of writers I was exposed to on the music scene at that time,” she says.</p> <p>Along with her mentor and musical kindred spirit David Hardman, Rose made her 2000 album Nanahally River in a basement studio. “Recording [it] was really casual with a lot of friends helping me out,” she says. “I paid J.D. Wilkes from the Legendary Shack*Shakers to play harmonica on Nanahally River by cooking him chicken n dumplins. I like to think that added to the magic.”</p> <p>Fast-forward 10 years. “More than a decade passed between albums because I was busy raising a family, but always writing when inspiration struck,” Rose continues. “I’ve never just sat down with a goal of writing a song. They just show up and I document them the best I can. Fate interceded in early fall of 2010 when I was snuggling with my daughter and had headphones on listening to Ray Wylie Hubbard do a live interview for Twisted South Radio. They asked him what he’d been listening to lately. He said, ‘Well, I’ve been listening to this songwriter from Nashville named Chelle Rose.’ I bolted up from the bed and heard him say he’d be interested in producing me. And the host, Zeke Loftin, who I had collaborated with on a charity event, said, ‘Chelle, if you’re listening you should call in.’ So I did, and I said, ‘You’re hired, let’s do it.’ A few weeks later I was off to Austin with my guitar and songs.”</p> <p>For Ghost of Browder Holler, Hubbard handpicked the players, who convened at engineer/bassist George Reiff’s Austin studio. “Every morning we’d sit at the kitchen table and pull one of my songs out of the hat,” Rose says. “Then we’d work out an arrangement and either agree or disagree to cut it. It was a beautiful, intense process that resulted in a record I’m so proud of.” That spontaneous approach — and the band playing all the basic tracks together in the studio — helped preserve the disc’s cohesive live vibe.</p> <p>“What’s in the tracks is some hard core blood, sweat and tears from myself and many talented musicians who were generous with their contributions to the arrangements and to the soul of this album,” Rose declares. “I tried to quit music, but it just wouldn’t quit me. I realized I need it like I need food, water, sleep and love. It’s not about chasing fame or any kind of fortune. It’s about a strong connection with who I am. I share my music because it creates a beautiful exchange of energy in my life. It most certainly is medicine for my own soul. If it has the same effect on others, then I’m blessed.”</p> <p>###</p> <p>For more information about Chelle Rose, please contact Conqueroo:<br /> Cary Baker • (323) 656-1600 • cary@conqueroo.com</p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7376225/0b323390b6932b87092f3d98f50b70e4_poster.jpeg",""

They have become known for their hard-hitting style and politically-aware lyrics, focusing on racism, critical pedagogy, and activism against governmental hypocrisy, and corporate control over the media, especially hip-hop record labels. In 1990, M-1 headed to Tallahassee to attend FAMU (Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University) where he and Sticman met and connected due to their mutual love of music and knowledge. ""I was soaking up the Black Panther Party as a whole,"" M-1 remembers. ""I learned about their lives and it helped mold me."" ""I realized there’s a struggle already going on and I have to try to help ride it out,"" interjects Stic.man. M-1’s quest for insight led him to join the International Democratic People’s Uhuru Movement (InPDUM) in Chicago for three years while Stic.man remained behind in Florida and started getting into trouble. Burned out by the arduous labor of Uhuru, M-1 decided it was time to do that music thing and Stic.man agreed. Dead Prez transcribed the political education they acquired into lyrical poetry. Brand Nubian‘s Lord Jamar discovered them in New York and helped them sign a deal with Loud Records. But being the new kids on the block of a powerhouse label like Loud (home to the Wu-Tang Clan and Mobb Deep) wasn’t easy. dead prez wasn’t always Loud‘s priority but that didn’t stop them from building a fan base around their over-the-top performances. (They’ve been known to ignite dollar bills and toss apples into the audiences, declaring they eat healthy). Their debut album was Let’s Get Free, which had a minor hit with the song ""Hip-Hop"" the year before. The album was critically well-received, and included intense political diatribes featuring prominent black revolutionary Omali Yeshitela, as well as ""Animal in Man,"" a retelling of George Orwell‘s Animal Farm. Some argue that Let’s Get Free is one of the most influential albums in rap. In 2001 they collaborated with The Coup, another politically active hip-hop outfit, to release Get Up. In 2002, Dead Prez released the independent mix tape Turn Off the Radio Volume 1, followed by the release of Turn Off The Radio volume 2: Get Free Or Die Tryin’ in 2003. In 2004, Columbia Records finally released RBG: Revolutionary But Gangsta. Recently, M-1 has released a solo record featuring among others Styles P and Ghostface Killah.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/flying-lotus","Flying Lotus","WINNETKA, California, US","electronica, hip-hop, electronic, experimental","Flying Lotus’ albums are events. They’re not issued with a mechanic regularity and they don’t subscribe to recognized formulae. For those prone to astral traveling and metaphysical introspection they are another piece of the puzzle. For those, let’s say more ‘conventional’ listeners, the records are grand and ghostly sweeping movements – the sort of which are rarely undertaken at present. For being such a potent strain of future-thinking music, the scope of Flying Lotus’ full-lengths recall the ambition and vision of many older masters while at the same time look unflinchingly towards the beyond. As the psychic ripples caused by Flying Lotus’ Cosmogramma are still felt, the ground broken by its larger-than-life presence has proven to be very fertile soil indeed. That opus illustrated the universe that Flying Lotus inhabited, one in which Californian psychedelic gurus bumped elbows with Radiohead while the synthesizers were tuned to the strains of outré soul jams and the orchestra was conducted by the psilocybin-assisted movements of the deepest free-jazz nomads. From the neon afterglow of this ‘space-opera’ would come the vapor trails leading to FlyLo’s next revelation. Until The Quiet Comes. Composed, according to Flying Lotus, as “a collage of mystical states, dreams, sleep and lullabies” the album has the distinct feel of this nocturnal trip. From the twitching descent into a subconscious state and the out-of-focus time ether of the journey that follows, the sound is an unhinged, yet elegant evolution of the melodic and rhythmic interplay that is woven into the DNA of Flying Lotus’ aural personae. The meeting between earthy cosmic bass weight and computerized arrangements has never been more intertwined in this music than it is here, which not only speaks to an exponential growth as a producer and composer, but also the deeper conceptual flourishes at the foundation of the songs here. And of course the extended family is involved here, and has even grown significantly. Longtime muses of FlyLo, Niki Randa and Laura Darlington both return and remind us why they’re such cherished vocal collaborators – because few people can match the controlled and beautiful chaos of Flying Lotus’s productions with the same air of grace. Thom Yorke also returns to the fold with a sublime contribution to the digital free jazz of ‘Electric Candyman’ as does Thundercat (in addition to his cosmic bass-playing across the album) on the saucer-eyed ‘DMT Song’, which already has the trappings of a soul anthem for a new generation of psychedelic explorers. Of course, the Flying Lotus family tree has extended as well, and into the mix comes the inimitable queen of leftfield R&B herself, Erykah Badu – who’s turn on the epic rumble of ‘See Thru To U’ is one of many highlights. Flying Lotus is the center of a musical web that stretches far from the vibrant sprawl of Los Angeles, and joins so many like-minded individuals – whether it’s Earl Sweatshirt joining him on-stage at Coachella this year, fellow Oddfuture oddball Hodgy Beats collaborating on mixtapes or FlyLo spending some serious studio time with Black Hippy’s inimitable SchoolBoyQ. All this stylistic mingling and genre-melting from Flying Lotus has contributed significantly to shift music in a direction that once again prizes cohesive artistic statements and conceptual depth. However, he makes these intellectual leaps without forsaking the all-important heft of a bassline or unimpeded ‘swing’ of a drum beat – the same way so many masters of soul music have infused their songs for lovers and dancers with brilliant and heady subtext for decades. Until The Quiet Comes follows this tradition while clearing a path distinctly it’s own, which is a mark of a classic. “Quiet is relative for this antsy L.A. based producer, who convenes Thom Yorke, Erykah Badu and a rushing data stream for a stoned soul-jazz picnic.” – Rolling Stone, Best Dance Albums of 2012 “[Flying Lotus’] fourth album, Until the Quiet Comes, is, like its predecessors, a drop down a rabbit hole of moods, built with electronic instrumentation, hip-hop-inspired rhythms and jazzy tonal structures.” – NPR, Top 50 Albums of 2012 “It’s a twitchy, brooding digital dystopia stripped of any lyrical agenda so all that remains is a mood of restless agitation.” – The Guardian, #19 Best Album of 2012","<p>Flying Lotus’ albums are events.

Inspired by the magnetism of San Francisco, the grind of Los Angeles and the serenity of the Big Sur Coast, their songs are a joyous revival of rock n’ roll, a twisting indie-folk dance and a heartfelt protest ballad. Sliding from indie pop to country and a host of genres in between, the band evokes modern artists such as Fun., Grouplove and Edward Sharpe And the Magnetic Zeros, whilst having their roots in the music of Neil Young, The Byrds, The Beach Boys and Fleetwood Mac. Part 60’s Laurel Canyon, part 70’s Venice Beach and part 10’s Silverlake, the band and the harmonies are held together by their message of universal love, peace and the belief that the highest form of consciousness is achieved by togetherness and unity.

With the original trio augmented by second guitarist Roddy Radiation, singer Terry Hall, drummer John ‘Brad’ Bradbury and MC Neville Staples, the West Midlands septet’s high octane blend reflected their multiracial background and diverse musical interests. Taking their name from the Jamaican hoodlums of the Sixties, Specials fans dubbed themselves ‘rude boys’ and dressed in loafers, Sta-Pres trousers, two-tone ‘tonic’ suits and bluebeat hats.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/man-without-country","Man Without Country","Cardiff, Wales","electronica, electronic, shoegaze, dream pop","MWC are a thrilling modern duo with tour de force dynamics yet a lingering afterburn in both sound and vision. Their intensely atmospheric sonic palette combines manic and eerie synth pulses, glacial guitar ripples, heavy bass and haunting vocals that describe a relentlessly compelling world view – uneasy, heavy, confrontational. As MWC’s Tomas Greenhalf says, “You don’t know whether to dance to us or just listen to it, and wallow in it.” Greenhalf and Ryan James don’t think they’re alone in presenting the dark/uplifting paradox; they name check a handful of Scandinavian artists, such as The Knife, When Saints Go Machine and The Field. But none of them place such an emphasis on lyrics as MWC, and certainly none of them grew up in Wales. The way Man Without Country don’t belong in any one camp begins with their name, chosen because of a shared, “sense of not belonging.” Coming from remote parts of South Wales Greenhalf and James felt isolated and alienated by small-town life, and it was only after meeting on a popular music degree in 2006 that they discovered they weren’t alone. In fact, both admit the reason they were taking the course, they say, was, “to find other musicians.” For months, they exchanged emails of “audio snippets,” and with common ground established, the duo rented a rehearsal space to take one step further. “We were new to electronics so spent a lot of time experimenting with sounds” confesses Greenhalf, who was playing piano and saxophone at the time. A major fan of Eno and Stockhausen, and inheriting his parents’ love of Pink Floyd – “it’s that sheer epic and moody nature of the music” – Greenhalf was then writing more instrumental music, but after meeting James, he found a partner who could turn his music into structured songs. James, who says he was a bit of a metalhead in his early teen years, discovered Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service when he was 16: “That’s when I first realised the sort of music that was my calling, and that I wanted to sing. I hadn’t realised before how creative and upfront you could be with lyrics and poetry, which took me down a different road.” But it wasn’t until they decided to “become more of a band,” by adding a drummer that real progress was made, and 18 months after those first email exchanges, Man Without Country played its first live show. Three years later, MWC have refined and broadened their epic, piercing musical vistas drenched in visceral, gut-level poetry. The band name comes from Kurt Vonnegut’s essay collection A Man Without A Country (A Memoir Of Life In George W Bush’s America) from 2005, and like Vonnegut, James tends to looks at life aghast, with an air of anger, satire and sadness. But these are hard times, with lines drawn between opposing forces. And the name of MWC’s debut album? A very simple Foe and more evidence of the duo’s deep-seated alienation. When it comes to explaining lyrics, James can be very guarded. “Some lyrics are more personal” he says, “and some are more ambiguous than others”. But he’s willing to lay down some clues. For starters, the album’s title track: “Foe sums up the lyrics of the whole album, a very short three-letter word, for a quite hateful album.” From direct accusations (“I’m so embarrassed that I carry your name” in “Closet Addicts Anonymous”) to more oblique attack (“lower lifeboats as you sail through murky water, wear your blindfold, ball and chain. August daughter”. “Migrating Clay Pigeon”), the effect is chilling and alarming. MWC’s musical span follows suit: “King Complex” (the lead track of the EP that preceded Foe) is as fast and full-on an attack (“your head is like a lost balloon, drifting through the clouds”) as “Ebb & Flow” is slow and imbued with a loneliness you can almost taste (“my soul’s being sold in every note I hold”). But again, these tracks were chosen for their shared continuity of sound, “there’s a feel to the music that matches the lyrics,” says Greenhalf. “The music is often moody, dark and melancholic, usually in minor keys. But there are also some uplifting passages which emphasize the poignancy of the lyrics”. For such a dynamic sound, it’s impressive that Foe was recorded in their bedrooms, save for drums and some guitar that needed better and bigger facilities. But Foe has a secret weapon, namely legendary producer Ken Thomas, who agreed to mix the album – along with MWC – because he loved the songs. Greenhalf: “We’d never had any outside involvement in our work, so it was good to have an impartial point of view, to bring a fresh perspective on the music. We’re fans of not only Sigur Rós but M83 and Cocteau Twins, and Ken’s collaborated with all of them. His work with punk and post-punk bands like Psychic TV, 23 Skidoo and Clock DVA is also relevant to the outcome of Foe, we wanted that edge and energy, to prevent the songs from sounding too clean and clinical”. Thomas’ influence can be felt in the slowly building tidal wave that is “Inflammable Heart” and the gnarly intensity of “Migrating Clay Pigeon,” but also the softer synthscape of “Clipped Wings” and the ambient, lengthy “Parity”. But MWC aren’t content with creating a sound and leaving it there. When it comes to live shows, says Greenhalf, “we want to treat the songs differently, to exaggerate and lengthen different elements, so that it’s a unique live experience.“ Mike Monaghan is MWC’s live drumming powerhouse, though MWC also sometimes play without drums, as a more minimalist duo, “to vary the sound even more. It gives everything more room to breathe and picks out the subtleties.” From stormy to subtle, swooning to haunting, scorching to soothing, Man Without Country are many things. Yet they stand alone in modern music.

As it turns out, however, the cloth didn’t appreciate young Paul’s affinity for dirty jokes, Prince, and Tom Waits, and he was inclined to search elsewhere for co-conspirators. He began plying his trade with whomever would have him, and happily, folks were mostly impressed by his efforts.

As it turns out, however, the cloth didn’t appreciate young Paul’s affinity for dirty jokes, Prince, and Tom Waits, and he was inclined to search elsewhere for co-conspirators. He began plying his trade with whomever would have him, and happily, folks were mostly impressed by his efforts.

Perfectly coupled. Ben’s songwriting is as bold in range as it is in ferocity. Fueled by a quality of melodrama and powerful lyricism, it’s the romance and the manhood crashing with his voice that gives Caplan a truly innovative and experimental artistry. A sound that bridges the gap between controlled composition and unruly passion. Striding in pace with gypsy-inspired strings amid the sultry tones of clarinet and saxophone, Caplan has marked his place in the Canadian music landscape with a growling spirit similar to that of Tom Waits. Caplan’s tours have extended throughout the Commonwealth, the rhapsodic energy in his live show an elegant cacophony gaining attention around the world. Breaking between guitar, banjo, piano, and melodica, Caplan’s stage show is almost reminiscent of a burly and bearded Freddy Mercury; a raging, strong, and exploratory songwriter, it’s the blues in his soul, and the heart in your chest pounding as one that makes Ben Caplan & The Casual Smokers an act not to be missed. Ben Caplan has been a touring musician for the past five years. Seasoned in coast-to-coast travel, Caplan his seen stages in the UK and has performed at a rolodex of festivals. What People Have Said About The Casual Smokers: Stephanie Domet, CBC Radio1 – Atlantic Airwaves: “Ben understands that in this business it’s not enough to just climb on stage and sing songs. You need to be an entertainer as well. You need to entertain and engage the audience – and that he does in spades…. Keep an ear on Ben. You’ll be hearing more from him, I’m sure!” Bryan Acker, Herohill.com “Caplan and his talented band – The Casual Smokers – will undoubtedly garner review after review build around on his voice, but even when they deliver the roughtest of bar room stomps, there is a surprising depth and musicianship to the songs… Caplan and the Casual Smokers stand out from the masses influenced by the same sounds.” Craig Norris, Host CBC Radio 3: “I really like your stuff. And now I want everyone out there to hear your stuff… it’s kind of rough around the edges, has a real sort of bar room, salooney, Tom Waits vibe to it; wicked playing, and great delivery. I cannot wait until the full length real record comes out.” Slowcoustic.com: I don’t pretend to have known Ben Caplan for years but damn it after this video from his Green Couch Session, I wish I did. While his day job with “Ben Caplan & the Casual Smokers” is not quite as stripped down and acoustic as the below video, if you are looking for slightly bluesy, jazzy, folky tunes – you should check them out! Amelia Curran, Singer-Songwriter: “He’s like Freddy Mercury meets Mr. Bungle” Peter Katz, Singer-Songwriter: “More like Freddy Mercury meets God!” Paul Cram, Bandleader, Producer, Improviser, Musician: I played with Ben Caplan and the Casual Smokers the other night and It was great fun. I love the energy of their minor slinky music, cause it’s bendable and makes you wanna wail.. It was also a nice surprise to play with a “horn section” improvising around arrangements for violin, Cello and winds on solid songwriting that could take the punishment and throw it back: Klezmer/Torch Balkan Jazz/Folk/…anyone? Joe Bigda-Peyton, Psychology Major: Although still able to recognize fear-evoking facial expressions, there is a clear indication that Ben Caplan has experienced some damage to his anterior and possibly even posterior amygdale. Joe Girard, Expert: “The music of Ben Caplan is the cure for diarrhea, malaria, and malignant ennui!

Home to a prolific but unsung underground music community, it is a city that keeps its secrets, but over the past few years Royal Bangs have become a hard secret to keep. Under Royal Bangs and various other guises, frontman Ryan Schaefer, drummer Chris Rusk, and guitarist Sam Stratton have been making music together since their high school days. In 2006, they unleashed their home-recorded and self-released breakthrough album We Breed Champions. The record’s potent noise-pop wormed its way into hearts throughout the southeastern US, eventually finding its way to Patrick Carney (The Black Keys), who reissued We Breed Champions on his own Audio Eagle Records in May of 2008. In the meantime, Royal Bangs went on hiatus as Schaefer spent a year in France, soaking up Euro dance music and entitlement culture as inspiration for the early stages of a follow-up. After Schaefer’s return to the States, the band used the promotion of their brand-new, two-year old record as an opportunity to refine their live performance. The result was an incessant touring schedule, including stops at Bonnaroo, SXSW, and a series of shows opening for The Black Keys in the fall of 2008.In February of 2009, on the eve of City Slang’s well-received European release of We Breed Champions, Royal Bangs traveled to Tangerine Sound Studios in Akron, Ohio to record their long-awaited sophomore album. The resulting Let It Beep, released on Audio Eagle in September 2009, finds the band’s sound looking more than ever in two seemingly conflicting directions: an increased emphasis on the electronic — from spastic, syrup-thick synths to dancy drum programming — coupled with earnest echoes of fervid 70s rock legends like Springsteen and Thin Lizzy. But the core of their sound, rooted in the indie rock renaissance and Schaefer’s hook-heavy arrangements, embraces both tendencies without allowing them to diverge, resulting in an album that might be described as both challenging and accessible if not for the phrase “pure goddamn fun.” With a third album in the works, Royal Bangs continue to tour within an easy day’s drive of your home.Watch videos of Royal Bangs playing a Shiner Beer Session at The Do512 Lounge!","<p>Royal Bangs are three electric gents from Knoxville, Tennessee, sentinel of the Smoky Mountains.

Later, they teamed up with Diara, one of the more exciting guitarist of Tinariwen, who is also Sanou’s uncle. Diara is also the brother of Intiyeden, co-founder of Tinariwen with Ibrahim Abaraybone who passed in 1994. After performing on Terakaft’s first two albums Bismilla (2007) and Akh Issudar (2008), Kedou left the band, which is now led by Diara and supported by three young musicians: Sanou (guitars, vocals), Abdallah (bass, guitars, vocals) and Mahamad (percussions, vocals).

There’s nothing astonishing about the similarity if you consider that Terakaft was founded by Kedou and is now led by Diara, both of whom were formative members of Tinariwen. Kedou, a celebrity in his own land thanks to his involvement in the Rebellion and his songwriting, founded Terakaft in 2001 with a very young Sanou.

With their warm, layered production, hit flavored melodies, hazy melancholic vocals and balearic vibe their music evokes images of dusk till dawn beach-parties, bittersweet road trips and dusty mirrorballs in long forgotten clubs. With only one EP and two singles released in their own founded Brennnessel label, the three-piece band were immediately credited as one of Poland’s best export products, being featured in music press, prime-time radio playlists and playing tons of energetic, often sold-out club and festival gigs in Poland, and some of the most important global music events such as SXSW, Great Escape or Exit Festival. In September 2011 Kamp! released their first international single “Cairo” in the portuguese label Discotexas. The release, which included Beatport top ten remix by Moullinex, has been critically acclaimed by countless music writers, blogs and musicians (the original song opened one of The Magician’s famous mixtapes) around the globe.

Plastic monkeys! These are among the pop-culture artifacts that appear in the epilepsy-inducing slideshow video for “Hurricane,” the first single from MS MR. Until recently shrouded in anonymity, the atmospheric indie-pop duo from New York City has proven universally intriguing, earning breathless attention from Pitchfork, Forbes, and Perez Hilton alike.In the trip-hoppy “Hurricane,” smoky-voiced Lizzy Plapinger sings, “Welcome to the inner workings of my mind/So dark and foul I can’t disguise,” while a push-and-pull of echoey strings and staccato percussion (courtesy of the producer stylings of Ms Mr other half Max Hershenow) envelop her voice. Technically, the song, which hit No. 1 on Hype Machine, is about Hurricane Irene, which careened towards Gotham last year. The video? Not so much.“I see something different every time I watch it,” concedes Max. “The video is sort of a cross section of the images we’ve collected on Tumblr, which we essentially use as an ongoing mood board.” If there’s one philosophy driving MS MR (pronounced “miss mister”) —dabblers in chaos theory who’re as goofy as they are thoughtful—it’s media-theorist Marshall McLuhan’s famous observation that the medium is the message. MS MR are so committed to that sentiment they handpicked each “Hurricane” image themselves.“We’re interested in exploring the nature of mixed media and collage,” says Lizzy, “and how music transcends all these various platforms.” Chief among them: MS MR’s lively—if thoroughly mystifying—Tumblr page, which they unprecedentedly used to debut their second EP, the critically acclaimed Candy Bar Creep Show, song-by-song. (Their first release, Ghost City USA, was a self-released collection of demos.)The EP, which sets the foundation for MS MR’s still-untitled album (out early next spring), references everything from ’80s to’90s pop, doo-wop to country. That kitchen-sink aesthetic won the attention of vintage-sound wiz Tom Elmhirst (Adele, Amy Winehouse), who mixed and did some additional production on it at the legendary Electric Lady Studios. “Tom helped us more fully realize the album as we imagined it” says Max. “He responds to music more emotionally and viscerally than anyone I’ve ever met. It was the perfect match.”The aural Jenga that is MS MR was born of Lizzy and Max’s vast inspirations. “We both listen to a lot of different music from all different genres and time periods,” says Max. “So we like to approach each song as its own project and experiment with combining unexpected elements.”It’s a stroke of serendipity that Lizzy and Max are even making music together. They may giggle uncontrollably and complete each other’s thoughts, but these Vassar alums never really knew each other during college. Lizzy was a media-studies major, releasing records under her burgeoning imprint Neon Gold. (She’s gone on to release records by artists such as Passion Pit and Ellie Goulding.) Max was an urban-studies major with a concentration in modern dance, and started composing music for his choreographies. They met fleetingly through friends. But really connected after they graduated, when Lizzy needed an unbiased sounding board for her secret project, and Max was looking for new artists to collaborate with.“There was sort of an element of Internet dating to it,” Max says, laughing. “Throw caution to the wind! Send someone an email, hope for the best.” He liked what he heard, which only terrified Lizzy more. “I was nervous because I had never sung in front of anyone before, so when he told me he was interested I actually put it off for a few months.”They finally connected three months later in December 2010. To find their footing as collaborators, they recorded a sweeping cover of Patrick Wolf’s “Time of My Life” in Max’s closet-turned-studio. Curious to see where else the music could take them, they decided to give it another go and try their hand at some original material. This led to the swelling, mercurial tune we know now as “Bones.“ ”It’s quite a personal song and definitely set a tone for the band,"" says Lizzy. “In person, we’re quite upbeat and bubbly, but the music is a much more honest space and outlet for us.""Only now, it’s become public. MS MR finally unveiled their live personae in March with a rocked-out gig at Brooklyn’s respected Glasslands Gallery. “I think people maybe expected two people on stage with a laptop, but we were adamant from the beginning that we would never do that!” says Lizzy. “We wanted the live show to do the recoded tracks justice,” continues Max, “so we perform as a band to give it the lushness and energy we aim for while recording.” Since their Glasslands show, they’ve moved on to bigger venues while touring with Marina and the Diamonds, an outing they affectionately refer to as their ""training-wheels tour.”“Really,” continues Max, “this whole experience has been about discovering undiscovered parts of ourselves.""","<p>Edward Scissorhands.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/action-bronson-","Action Bronson","Queens, NY","hip-hop, underground hip-hop, new york","A raunchy, cylinder-shaped ginger of Eastern European ancestry might not be the first dude you’d peg for rap stardom, but that’s exactly the mantle Action Bronson is on the verge of possessing. Over the last two years, the 28-year old Queens native has become one of hip-hop’s most charismatic and colorful new characters, thanks to his wicked sense of humor, a buffet of impressive releases and the rare knack for updating cherished East Coast aesthetics into indisputably modern music. Last year, The New York Times hailed Bronson as “one of the most promising prospects in New York hip-hop.” That formidable potential is now being realized. When Bronson gleefully tossed slabs of meat from Peter Luger’s famed steakhouse into a wild-ass crowd at the Music Hall of Williamsburg, the mosh pit of skaters, knuckleheads, rap purists and young women was evidence of his ever-widening appeal. Born Ariyan Arslani, Bronson grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, the son of an Albanian immigrant father and a Jewish mother from Brooklyn. He was an only child, but the population of the two-bedroom apartment swelled to as many as 13 inhabitants due to cousins, aunts, uncles and refuges from ethnic strife in Kosovo. It was in the family restaurant that Bronson developed his enduring fascination with quality eating. After studying in the Art Institute of New York’s culinary program, he took jobs ranging from busboy to sous chef. Consequently, songs in his discography often read like menu items: “Roasted Bone Marrow,” “Pouches of Tuna,” “Jerk Chicken,” “Ceviche.” Rolling Stone, appreciating the theme, described Bronson’s music as “the ultimate in comfort food, with a contemporary twist.” While Bronson was a ravenous musical connoisseur who grew up admiring artists like Kool G. Rap, Cam’ron and Mobb Deep, he never contemplated rapping himself. But a few years back, he penned a satirical song over a Southern beat CD and the results were improbably impressive. With an oversized personality, intricate wordplay and the cagy charm of an outer-borough striver, he was a natural. And after a broken leg forced him out of the kitchen, Bronson began writing seriously. In 2007, joined with Mayhem Lauren and Jay Steele to release the Last of a Dyin’ Breed: Volume 1 mixtape under the collective name “The Outdoorsmen.” Bronson’s insistent delivery and penchant for flamboyant phraseology initially drew some comparisons to Ghostface, but he has long since matured beyond such superficialities. In 2011 alone, he released Bon Appetit… Bitch!, The Program EP, Dr. Lecter and Well Done. 2012 introduced collaborations with artists like Earl Sweatshirt, Riff Raff and SpaceGhostPurp, as well as Blue Chips, the brilliant street album produced by Party Supplies. In awarding the effort a lofty 8.1, Pitchfork called Bronson “one of the most hilarious and creative writers in rap” who savagely captured the essence of New York’s seedy soul: “It is what a Weegee photograph would look like now.” In August of 2012, Bronson signed with Vice/Warner Bros Records. With the leading youth media company’s multi-platform power now backing him, forthcoming projects like Rare Chandeliers with Alchemist, Saab Story with Harry Fraud and Blue Chips 2 will find countless new listeners. His debut LP on Vice/Warner Bros. Music is scheduled for 2013. For Action Bronson, this accelerating rise to greatness may just persuade him to put off “laying back, eating poutine” for a little while longer.","<div>A raunchy, cylinder-shaped ginger of Eastern European ancestry might not be the first dude you’d peg for rap stardom, but that’s exactly the mantle Action Bronson is on the verge of possessing.

For Action Bronson, this accelerating rise to greatness may just persuade him to put off “laying back, eating poutine” for a little while longer.</div> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/5355835/1ac6975fa0c4bba1d0557c6ad9ff94a9_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/uiAQ9xQQHeQ?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

He began songwriting at age 12. The following year, he started a band called Flood, who covered Creed and 311 and sold homemade cassettes to classmates. In high school, heavily influenced by Elvis Costello and The Cars, Dent fronted a power-pop band called The Rockwells. Feeling like an outsider in Mississippi, he retreated to the Internet, where he spent his time soaking in pop music and culture from around the globe. After dropping out of NYU film school, Dent founded Oxford, Mississippi’s self-proclaimed “infotainment cult” Cats Purring. Since then, his musical endeavors have included a debut LP of ukulele tunes on Paw Tracks, dance recordings under the Dent Sweat moniker, and a mysterious unfinished psych-country rock opera called Cowboy Maloney’s Electric City. He throws notorious DIY shows at his home, a former Boys & Girls club now deemed the Cats Purring Dude Ranch. Recent singles on Forest Family and Paw Tracks have found Dent abandoning the ukulele in favor of cosmic synths, funky guitars, analog drum machines, loopy bass lines, and massive vocal harmonies. He played all the instruments on his new album Do Things, which was recorded at the Dude Ranch and in a friend’s rural cabin by a cotton field.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-dear-hunter","The Dear Hunter","Providence, RI","rock, indie, experimental, progressive rock","The Dear Hunter is the full-time project of Casey Crescenzo, formerly of post-hardcore band The Receiving End of Sirens. The band got its name from the lead character of the story that he wrote to go along with the music. The sound is unlike that of Casey’s former band, with more alternative and progressive rock tendencies and a wider variety of instrumentation. The band began as a side project of Casey Crescenzo when he was full time member of the Boston, Massachusetts band The Receiving End of Sirens. It was originally intended as a vehicle for music Casey had written that didn’t fit with the heavier sound of The Receiving End of Sirens. In the winter of 2005 Casey recorded the Dear Ms. Leading demos. He created 10 copies of the demos on burned CDs intended for the ears of friends, and they began circulation. At the time he did not plan to pursue The Dear Hunter full time and allowed the demos to be placed online for download. On February 2, 2006, The Dear Hunter played its first show with The Receiving End of Sirens as the backing band. In May 2006, Casey left The Receiving End of Sirens and began work on The Dear Hunter’s first studio album. He expanded the scope of the project to a six-album story set at the dawn of the 20th century about the birth, life, and abrupt death of a boy, known only in the story as ""The Dear Hunter."" In a 2007 interview with music website Absolutepunk.net, Casey stated that he already has the overall story of The Dear Hunter mapped out, with each act in 1-3 page treatments. Casey produced and recorded the EP by himself with only of the help of his brother on drums and mother on backing vocals. Act I: The Lake South, The River North was released in September 2006 on Triple Crown Records. Shortly after the EP’s release, Casey recruited Luke Dent of the recently split band Faraway for vocals and keyboards and Erick Serna as a second guitarist. Luke brought in his brother Sam Dent on drums and Erick brought long-time friend Josh Rheault in to play bass. The complete band entered the studio in late 2006 to record the follow-up to Act I. Recording finished in early 2007. Act II: The Meaning of, and All Things Regarding Ms. Leading was released May 22, 2007, only eight months after the band’s previous release. The band recently finished filming a music video for the song The Church And The Dime. They have also announced that they are currently working on nine albums, each of which is inspired by a different color of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet), with black and white added as bookends. They will include many guest appearances, and will span many different genres of music. Casey has said that the band’s main focus will still be the Act albums and music, but that each of the color albums will be from 30 to 60 minutes in length. A book based on the story of Act II is currently in the works. Artist Kent St. John was selected to do the illustrations, the progress of which can be seen on his blog. Prior to a string of dates with Circa Survive, Josh Rheault and brothers Sam and Luke Dent all left the band. Temporary replacements for the November tour dates included Cliff Sarcona and Julio Tavarez of As Tall as Lions and Andy Wildrick of The Junior Varsity. Wildrick would later join the band as a permanent member, along with Sagan Jacobson of Crown Atlantic on bass and Casey’s brother Nick Crescenzo on drums. The band embarked on their first headlining tour in mid-2008 with Lydia, Eye Alaska, and You, Me, and Everyone We Know. After the tour, the band plans to enter the studio to record Act III, which they hope to release in early 2009.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/funeral-suits","Funeral Suits","Dublin","indie, punk, alternative, post-punk","FUNERAL SUITS: LILY OF THE VALLEY Funeral Suits come from Dublin, Ireland and make rock music. Sometimes they make it dark, brooding, intense and monolithic. Sometimes they make it life affirming, surging and adrenalin charged. It’s beauty and beast combined in schizophrenic glory and it’s this duality which sets Funeral Suits apart. Their debut album ‘Lily Of The Valley’ has been produced by Stephen Street, best known for his work with Blur and The Smiths. Just released by leading Irish independent label Model Citizen, the album is a spellbinding showcase of shadows and light. Following a brace of well received limited edition EP’s, the final band line up of Brian James, Mik McKeogh, Greg McCarthy and Dar Grant released their debut single ‘Colour Fade’ on London based Friends Vs. Records in 2011. Along with the follow up ‘Health’, the song enjoyed support from Zane Lowe, Steve Lamacq and Huw Stephens. Following support slots with Franz Ferdinand, Passion Pit, The Macabees and Local Natives, the band played SXSW, The Great Escape and Leeds / Reading in 2011, before signing with Model Citizen. With three successful UK tours this year, ‘Lily Of The Valley’ has been warmly greeted by fans and critics alike. Recent single ‘All Those Friendly People’ with its stunning video, has enjoyed over one million views on YouTube. Current single ‘Hands Down’ has a thrilling sequel clip and can be picked up on very scarce Spanish 7” vinyl import. Radio support for the band continues to flourish at BBC Radio 1, XFM, BBC 6 Music, Q Radio, Absolute Radio and Amazing Radio. Meanwhile over in America, ‘Colour Fade’ is currently one of the most added tracks on the vast and influential US college radio network. Currently lining up dates their first European tour for early 2013, Funeral Suits really are a band cut from a different cloth.

In a city that’s direly needed an infusion of new, vital blood for a long time there are a growing number of bands that have emerged to offer original voices and bracing music. Super Water Sympathy are emblematic of the new breed, and their focus and direction belie their very short time together. In late August 2010 the band coalesced around brothers Billy and Clyde Hargrove (bass and guitar, respectively) and includes Ryan Robinson (drums), Jason Mills (keyboards) and Ansley Hughes (vocals). They realized that not only were their energies and sensibilities compatible, but that they simply sounded good playing together. Super Water Sympathy was born. Sweet synthesis They deliver taut, melodic music that’s both evocative and powerful. Billy and Ryan hold down the bottom end, and they’re met by the forceful mesh of guitar and keys that offers a fully formed, lyrics-ready framework. There’s an instinctive sense of structure at work, and the group’s current set bears this out. “We’re like what should have happened after the ‘90s,” offers Robinson. This tension and precision are evident on “Slade Was Made” and the fierce “Village,” wherein Hughes’ ferocity sets up a blistering guitar solo for a barnstorming net result that rocks like hell. The band shot a video for the addictive “You Us Hey” that’s definitely spread the message. Clyde and Jason set up the anthemic “Cherokee,” a track that perfectly joins lyric and arrangement, and there are surprises to be had such as the tempo-shifting, genre-splintering “Lucy Blue Who,” a jazzy little treat that coils and uncoils in sui generis delight Hughes, a heady admixture of Exene Cervenka and Siouxsie Sioux, layers the complexity of “Abzu” (a track of the caliber that most bands don’t deliver until way down the line), and the haunting, beseeching “Siren City” in which she pleads “…swallow me up by the salty sea…show me off to your family…” Stunner “Where Creswell Ends” builds to a dreamy swell that culminates in a crashing, brilliant cascade of sound, and again spawns a rich and bawling guitar solo. It’s powerful, engaging stuff indeed. In the current-day realms of popular music there are tradeoffs aplenty, with aspiring acts mining exhausted rock ‘n’ roll tropes and hollow, faux-confrontational poses. SWS hews to their own impulses, and when you’ve got their particular amalgam you don’t need to shop around to flesh out your approach. CD Vesper Belle enroute The band knew they needed a facility that could do their stuff justice, and decided on Sandbox Studio in Shreveport. They cut a few demos with Darren Osborn, and got dad Joe Osborn on board for the full-length, due in June. The duo’s expertise will show. “We’ve been in the studio for a while now,” says Clyde, and Billy notes of the record’s production “We don’t want to rush it.” It is available for pre-order on the band’s website, www.superwatersympathy.com. (Booking inquiries are directed to pyramidstarter@gmail.com). February was busy, as the band struck out for a series of regional dates, every one of which broadened their listener base and gained critical exposure. These shows (including a radio spot in College Station, Texas) were “…a really big deal for us,” says Ansley. “That was cool – that they thought we were good enough.” Soon there will be the album to tour behind, and other ideas to develop. “It’s the past mixing with the present…it’s the mainstream and counterculture meeting in the middle.” Clyde, while pragmatic, is also, like his bandmates, excited about the coming months – holding the physical record, promoting it, and the promise of further shows and new faces. “We’re really focused on getting out there…expanding out into the region,” he says. “We’ve had a good response with booking…we want to keep writing…to take over,” he finishes with a chuckle. And why not? Dave Bottoms Zeal Media Ltd. Shreveport ♫ New Orleans zealmedia1@gmail.com © 2011 FICTIONAL BIO: Super Water Sympathy’s origin began in the summer of 1393, during the final stages of the Yuson Dynasty. As this particular dynasty crumbled, the surging San’qaur Party moved their capital to Hanyang and proclaimed themselves rulers of the Korean peninsula. During the resulting reformation, Ansley Hughes (vocals) scraped by selling silk brocades to local merchants and traders. One day, the Minister of Rites, Yejo, asked Ansley, “If you sing me a song, I will purchase twenty brocades. Surely, that will be enough to support a Nobi (slave) for the duration of this lunar progression.” “Minister, you will hear me sing if, and only if, I’m given the twenty brocades before I begin."" “Ha! What is this, a Nobi giving me rules to follow? I think not!” “And what is this,” Ansley replied, “a pig of a man exploiting his power for paltry amusement?” Yejo, enraged by Ansley’s insult, sought immediate punishment and arrested her on the spot. She was sentenced and taken to the military fortification of Andyone, in which the notorious Byeongjo, Korean’s Minister of Defense, presided. Arriving at the console, she was processed and confined to a darkened cell containing four young men: Ryan Robinson (drums), Billy Hargrove (bass), Clyde Hargrove (guitar), and Jason Mills (piano). It wasn’t long before they began to discuss escape plans. To most, the notion of escaping from Byeongjo’s Andyone was impossible. Still, the five pressed on. The structure was completely fortified; there was no way to breach the structure physically. They would need help from someone on the inside – preferably, a guard. They had nothing to offer, in terms of money, but they still had their individual talents. Their strength lied in music. Perhaps if they could combine forces and create a unit, a band, they could provide the nearest guard with an array of melodies to catch his attention. They began to construct and play original music each and every night before going to sleep – loud enough to permeate from their tiny, darkened cell. They kept this up for a month, hoping someone had taken attention, before deciding to stop, abruptly. Days went by, and not a word was said. They began to panic. Perhaps their music wasn’t noticed, at all. And then, one night, they were awakened by a quiet knock on their cell. It was a guard. “Why did you stop the music?” he asked. They replied that they wouldn’t perform confined in a cell; the only way they would ever play again would be if they were on the outside, walking free. Frustrated, the guard retreated, only to return – with two additional guards – the next night. “Please play again – we’ll slip you extra rations. We need the music,” they pleaded. This went on, night after night, with more and more guards approaching their cell – finally, they reached an agreement. If the guards were to let them escape, they would form a band and travel the world performing their music – giving the guards infinite access to the melodies they’d fallen in love with. The guards agreed – reluctantly. They escaped just shy of dawn and made their way towards China. They decided to call their group Super Water Sympathy and played their first show in Beijing. From there, they continued to tour the Silk Road, garnering acclaim and popularity along the way. Today, Super Water Sympathy is recording their debut album, Vesper Belle.

She’s been singing as long as she can remember. Her brother used to punch her in the arm for constantly harmonizing with the radio, yet she could not put a sock in it. She got ants in her pants and moved to Chicago in 1997.Hogan began to hone her mellifluously spooky welter of torch songs and honky tonk anthems when she fronted the legendary peg-legged cabaret quartet, The Jody Grind, and then fanned the flames of her bummer-rock fixation while playing guitar for Orbisonic southern gothic punks, The Rock*A*Teens.

Song by song, the record takes surprising turns; while each track bears Whitehorse’s signature blistering guitar work and love-knotted vocals, their willingness to take risks while staying true to themselves makes for captivating listening. From the opening track, the psychedelic-meets-Spaghetti Western scorch of “Achilles’ Desire” to the sunset-on-water acoustic sparkler “Mismatched Eyes (Boat Song),” the Archies-esque “Out Like A Lion,” (sweetened with a dash of “Sugar, Sugar”), and the pulp influenced suspense of ""Devil’s Got A Gun,” the album covers impressive ground without compromising its artistic coherence.Whitehorse’s live show is built on mesmerizing guitar work and smoldering vocal chemistry, but also brings much more to the stage with complex layers of percussion, keyboard and telephone receiver amplification, tangled like an embrace with the help of looping pedals. Their sold out Winter Garden Theatre show in February, 2012 signaled their unquestionable arrival as a band. Whitehorse returns in ambitious fashion with a date at Massey Hall in 2013.With savage talent and tender hearts, Whitehorse expertly plays both lion and lamb on The Fate of This World Depends on This Kiss.

As the creator of one of the year’s most buzz-worthy independent releases, the 26 year-old Nashville native successfully showcased his unique ability to blend multiple genres into a singular dance floor groove. The son of renowned Jazz trumpeter, Gary “El Buho” Gazaway, the producer’s culturally diverse upbringing is reflected in his nuanced, multilayered instrumental arrangements. With a process the LA Times describes as “drawing a different design within a similar framework”, Gazaway’s cleverly executed remix/mashup projects gives audiences a familiar, yet fresh and distinct way to experience their favorite songs. The producer’s first full-length instrumental album, Selective Hearing Vol. 1, was released in 2010 on the Cold Busted label founded by veteran dance DJ, Vitamin D. Charting on Beatport’s top selling Chill-Out sales chart, the album introduced listeners to Gazaway’s tasteful use of samples and unique knack for combining diverse sounds into something completely new and original. While studying Digital Media at MTSU, Gazaway and fellow producer Wally Clark co-hosted the popular “Gummy Soul Show” on the now defunct Nashville radio station WRVU. The program, which featured rare 60’s and 70’s soul eventually morphed into a boutique record label co-owned and operated by the two former radio hosts. The label’s inaugural release came in the form of Kurtis Stanley’s – Gummy Soul album- a release for which Gazaway contributed production and established a heavy involvement in the label’s video production, album artwork/graphics, and web design. In 2011, Roots’ drummer Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson hit town with a per-announced DJ set at a local Nashville nightclub. Seeing the opportunity, Amerigo posed as a photojournalist, gained access to the club’s backstage area and cleverly slipped Questlove a copy of his just finished Fela Kuti/De La Soul mashup fusion, Fela Soul. Thompson, an avid afrobeat/native tongues fan called the album “brilliant” and published it to his website, Okayplayer. Quickly spreading to other outlets, the album made MTV Hive, The Source and BoingBoing before taking top 5 rankings on both NPR and Soul Train’s year-end “Best of 2011” list. On the one year anniversary of his Fela Soul release, Amerigo found success a second time with the recently released Bizarre Tribe; A Quest To The Pharcyde. In merging Pharcyde vocals over re-orchestrated A Tribe called Quest samples into an album Okayplayer calls “funky like your great-grandpas draws with a fish in it”, the album was downloaded over 30,000 times in its first two weeks of release.","<p>With the breakthrough release of 2011’s <strong>Fela Soul</strong>, Amerigo Gazaway’s sophomore effort was declared “a virtual web hit” (<span class=""caps"">MTV</span>) seemingly overnight.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-soul-rebels","The Soul Rebels","","","The Soul Rebels formed when Lumar LeBlanc and Derrick Moss, originally members of New Orleans’ iconic Dejean’s Young Olympia Brass Band, decided they wanted to play the new, exciting music they were hearing on the radio while respecting the tradition they loved. Both New Orleans natives, the pair was steeped in the fundamentals of New Orleans jazz, but inevitably, contemporary styles of music began to seep into their psyches. While LeBlanc attended the famed St. Augustine High School, Moss went to Lil’ Wayne’s alma mater McMain High School, and paraded alongside soon-to-be Cash Money Records CEO Ronald “Slim” Williams in the school’s marching band. New sounds were all around and they found them as exciting as the horn-combo style featured in jazz funerals since the turn of the Twentieth Century.“We wanted to make our own sound without disrespecting the brass tradition,” LeBlanc recalls, “so we knew we had to break away.” They found a stylistic middle ground when they spun off and formed a band of young, like-minded local players from all over New Orleans. Graduates of university music programs throughout the South, the band took the marching band format they had learned in school and incorporated influences from outside the city as well as late-breaking local styles – R&B, funk and hip-hop – especially through half-sung, half-rapped lyrics. “Most of our originals have vocals,” says LeBlanc. “You wouldn’t have done that in a traditional brass band.”Soon, the Soul Rebels’ contagious originals and updated takes on standards won them a loyal local audience. They began rocking some of New Orleans’ most beloved live music venues. A chance gig opening for the Neville Brothers got them a real start—and an official name. It was youngest brother Cyril Neville who first called them “Soul Rebels,” a good name for a band that strived to incite positive change in its treasured musical heritage.Since those days, the band has settled on an eight-piece lineup, building a career around an eclectic live show that harnesses the power of horns and drums in the party-like atmosphere of a dance club. Their weekly show at Uptown New Orleans spot Le Bon Temps Roulé has been known to descend into a sweaty shout-along as the band mixes up songs from its five studio albums with hits by Jay-Z and OutKast. While touring the U.S., the Soul Rebels have shared the stage with notable artists from many corners of the pop and jazz worlds, including Arcade Fire, The Roots, Bootsy Collins, Robert Plant & Jimmy Page, Counting Crows, Green Day, Drive By Truckers, James Brown, Roy Hargrove, Allen Toussaint, Chuck Brown, Terence Blanchard, The Gap Band, Better than Ezra and many more. Averaging around 250 shows per year, the Soul Rebels have brought the party to stages as far away as South Africa and Europe, playing some of the world’s best-known music events, including, Umbria Jazz Fest, Antibes Jazz Festival, The Montreal Jazz festival, Bonnaroo, the Wanee Festival and, of course, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.When Hurricane Katrina struck their hometown in 2005, the band scattered across the region. Though a few members relocated to cities in Texas, the band frequently reconvened for gigs in New Orleans, this time with a renewed purpose. “Music has been the number one vehicle for Katrina recovery,” says LeBlanc. “That catastrophe has brought so much world wide attention to our music.” Indeed, since the storm, the band has been more successful than ever serving as an international ambassador of the New Orleans sound. Now a hardcore touring band with a solid-as-ever lineup, the band has recently represented its hometown on television, appearing in the season finale of the HBO series Treme, the Discovery Channel hit After the Catch, and the NBC broadcast of the parade before the Saints’ winning 2010 Super Bowl. In January of 2012, the band released its first international album, Unlock Your Mind, on Rounder Records. This new song-driven studio effort includes guest appearances by Cyril Neville, Trombone Shorty and Meters guitarist Leo Nocentelli. The album was produced by Rounder VP of A&R Scott Billington, who was also at the helm of many of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band’s groundbreaking albums.The Soul Rebels continue charting new territory today. Called “the missing link between Public Enemy and Louis Armstrong” by the Village Voice, the Soul Rebels combine top notch musicianship and songs with grooves that celebrate life in time-honored New Orleans style.","<p><b>The Soul Rebels formed when Lumar LeBlanc and Derrick Moss, originally members of New Orleans’ iconic Dejean’s Young Olympia Brass Band, decided they wanted to play the new, exciting music they were hearing on the radio while respecting the tradition they loved.

Now a hardcore touring band with a solid-as-ever lineup, the band has recently represented its hometown on television, appearing in the season finale of the <span class=""caps"">HBO</span> series Treme, the Discovery Channel hit After the Catch, and the <span class=""caps"">NBC</span> broadcast of the parade before the Saints’ winning 2010 Super Bowl. <br>In January of 2012, the band released its first international album, Unlock Your Mind, on Rounder Records. This new song-driven studio effort includes guest appearances by Cyril Neville, Trombone Shorty and Meters guitarist Leo Nocentelli. The album was produced by Rounder VP of A&R Scott Billington, who was also at the helm of many of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band’s groundbreaking albums.<br>The Soul Rebels continue charting new territory today. Called “the missing link between Public Enemy and Louis Armstrong” by the Village Voice, the Soul Rebels combine top notch musicianship and songs with grooves that celebrate life in time-honored New Orleans style.</b></p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7229089/url-3_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/9RWRa-7vd-Q?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

Every band experiences the highs and lows of the music business, and Residual Kid haven’t been immune to either.

A fresh set of songs on their debut EP, television appearances, bigger shows with cool Austin bands, and media attention began to feel the rewards of hard work and dedication. Then…everything changed. The departure of the band’s primary singer and contributing songwriter at the peak, caused a pause in the Winter of 2011. After some serious consideration, the three original members Ben, Deven, and Max decided to regroup, refocus, and redefine the sound of Residual Kid. Just a few months out of the scene, the band returned to the stage with new material and a new sound, much to the approval of their old fans and gaining new fans rapidly.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/paramore","Paramore","Franklin, TN","","Sometimes things just fall in to place. The five members of Paramore, vocalist Hayley Williams (17), bassist Jeremy Davis (21), lead guitarist Josh Farro (18), drummer Zac Farro (15) and guitarist Hunter Lamb (20) all discovered music on their own, in different ways, but as soon as they got together something just clicked. The confident, upbeat music found on their debut album ALL WE KNOW IS FALLING exudes a rare natural chemistry that is easily addictive and makes them impossible to ignore.It is this chemistry that keeps Paramore together and sets them apart from their peers. The young band came together in Franklin, Tennessee after 13 year-old Hayley moved into town and met two brothers – Josh and Zac Farro. The three enlisted bassist Jeremy Davis and began performing almost immediately. Newly christened Paramore, they played at local gatherings and their school talent show before graduating to rock venues in and around Franklin. The combination of musical energy between brothers and Hayley’s bold charisma earned them instant attention, particularly from Florida indie Fueled by Ramen, who signed the band and put them to work recording their debut. Says Hayley, “Some of our favorite bands are on Fueled by Ramen. We knew that they would know exactly how to carry out the vision for our band and music.” Paramore went into the studio with producers James Wisner (Dashboard Confessional, Further Seems Forever, Underoath) and Mike Green (Yellowcard, The Black Maria) and blew them away with their sincerity and enthusiasm.With the record complete, the band hit the road hard, touring constantly with Simple Plan, Straylight Run, The Vans Warped Tour and more, impressing crowds and critics with their passionate positivism. SPIN.com called lead singer Hayley a “powerhouse”, Alternative Press declared their songs “explosive and melody rich” and named them a band to watch in 2006, and The New York Times said ALL WE KNOW IS FALLING is one of the best, underrated albums of the year. MTV was so impressed that they chose them for a “You Hear It First” feature.Paramore describe their music with three words: energetic, emotional and fun. Their live show is explosive and high energy and showcases the bands relentless drive to make sure the audience is having as good a time as they are. In addition to her open-hearted vocal style, Williams has worked hard to expose her life and emotions in her songs. “I always try to write from personal experience,” says Hayley “At first what I was writing was kind of metaphorical, but now I’ve been trying to be more straightforward. It’s all about things that have happened to me or to the people that I love.” Paramore are truly all friends, friends who love playing together and have fun doing it. They share a common goal – to connect with people, and their enthusiasm is catching.","<p>Sometimes things just fall in to place.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/suuns","Suuns","Montreal, Canada","electronica, electronic, experimental, psychedelic","Montreal’s Suuns possess a rare trait in rock music: restraint. They use it like an instrument, which makes their debut full-length Zeroes QC as unsettling as it is wonderfully exasperating. It’s immediately apparent in album opener “Armed for Peace,” a track that starts off like a robot breaking down in a hot desert; the song’s mechanic beat plods like iron-shoed footsteps as the melody of a wheezing synth mirrors the crackling sound of old transistors and circuitry being cooked in the sun. It’s deceptively lulling, the tension almost unnoticeably wrenching up and up until the track unexpectedly opens into a barrage of nose-diving guitar riffs and crashing drums – yet the band still stays locked on the song’s linear, forward-motion direction. Suuns were born during the summer of 2006 when vocalist/guitarist Ben Shemie and guitarist/bassist Joe Yarmush got together to make some beats which quickly evolved into a few songs. The duo were soon joined by drummer Liam O’Neill and bassist/keyboardist Max Henry to complete the line-up. “I don’t think we were really a ‘band’ for the first year,” Ben surmises. It wasn’t until a friend helped them procure a spot at Pop Montreal 2007 that he says the group played their first “real gig.” Last year, Suuns entered Breakglass Studios with Jace Lasek of the Besnard Lakes co-producing and engineering, and recorded their first album. The group wanted to create something that couldn’t be pigeonholed as simply indie rock. “Jace definitely had a huge impact for bringing to life the big sound of the band and being open and willing stretch out any idea we or he had,” Ben explains. The resulting Zeroes QC is a warm yet dark, propulsive collusion of pop, post-punk and experimental rock – one that allows the group to musically shapeshift without losing any of the sense of tension and unease that runs throughout the record. During tracks like “Gaze,” tightly wound guitars and bass ring and buzz atop Liam’s metronomic, powerhouse drumming, with Ben’s cool, detached vocals acting as a nervy counterweight as he delivers falsely assuring lines like, “Don’t you be yourself, you are someone else.” Often his close-miced sing/speak is as metronomic as it is melodic; in “Arena” Ben’s rhythmic “What-choo, what-choo”’s are reminiscent of Suicide’s Alan Vega as he leads the band’s death disco groove into a bloodbath of razor-sharp guitars, while his icy, hushed delivery in “Sweet Nothing” is almost as motorik as the song itself. Most impressive, though, is how Suuns effortlessly sculpt memorable pop songs from experimental building blocks, frequently using noise and space as actual hooks. All of this amounts to a great first album – one that is as timeless as it is thrillingly modern.","<p>Montreal’s Suuns possess a rare trait in rock music: restraint.

Social Studies has become a force to be reckoned with in concert as well, transfixing audiences at theCMJ Music Festival, SXSW, and Noise Pop, and bringing their unique energy and spirit to stages shared withtUnE-yArDs, Wye Oak, Lotus Plaza, Thee Oh Sees, Dodos, Dungen, and Au Revoir Simone just to name a few.With much of 2010 and 2011 spent on the road, the band returned to the studio in early 2012, enlisting the skills of ascendant Oakland engineer Eli Crews (tUnE-yArDs, Deerhoof, Thao & Mirah) to streamline their sound and refine their approach. With the stated goal of remaining as true to their hypnotic and driving live show as possible, the band dug deeper into texture, mood and repetition, stripping away some of the ornate flourishes that were a past hallmark to leave an anthemic core.

Staggering between beautiful, bursting synth-filled pop melodies and the complicated, often harsh consequences of reality in her lyrics, she unites these elements together in an explosion of vibrant emotion and hypnotizing intensity. Taking shape in early 2011, Mozart’s Sister thrives on complex layering, melding upbeat, sparkling dance loops with tremendous, belting vocals, only to morph into pulsating sci-fi drones and dark rhythms atop sensuous, assertive vocals. This sense of unexpected fluidity and change flows throughout Dear Fear, her self-recorded and self-released debut EP of 2011, dancing between the rhapsody and destructive components of sex, love and relationships. Labeled “bedroom paranoia,” Dear Fear explores the wild, untamed energy manifested within the confines of one’s own space and the inner power developed to break down these walls. In “Don’t Leave It To Me,” Thompson-Hannant belts, “I wrote this song after I met you,” a statement that Pitchfork praises, “if it resulted in a pop gem like this – you’re left feeling grateful for that chance encounter.” Influenced by mainstream R & B and Prince, ‘90s trip-hop and Björk, and the current shift in electronic music, Thompson-Hannant incorporates this sense of collage into her work, constantly transforming her voice and sound against a gorgeous, direct aesthetic with an uncontainable passion and sense of expression. Mixed in with the sassy, riveting confidence of defining groups like TLC and Salt-N-Pepa, Mozart’s Sister is also both influenced by and a part of the groundbreaking modern Montreal electronic music scene, characterized with the same vigor and charisma as such female contemporaries she’s shared the stage with, Grimes and tUnE-yArDs. Look for an upcoming release from Mozart’s Sister in 2013, one that leaves behind the bedroom paranoia and grasps control with a glittering, entirely arresting radiance.","<p>Mozart’s Sister is the captivating solo project of Montreal’s Caila Thompson-Hannant.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/reigning-sound","Reigning Sound","Asheville NC","","Founded by Memphis blues-punk legend Greg Cartwright — a former member of the Oblivians, the Compulsive Gamblers, and ‘68 Comeback — Reigning Sound fuse the hot-wired energy of garage rock with the deep emotional resonance of classic soul music in a manner that suggests a cross between the early Rolling Stones and the Sonics. Featuring Cartwright on vocals and guitar, Jeremy Scott on bass, Greg Roberson on drums, and Alex Greene on keyboards and guitar, Reigning Sound made their recorded debut with a three-song 7"" in May of 2001; their first full-length album, Break Up Break Down, was released a month later on Sympathy for the Record Industry. In August of 2002, the group upped the rock quotient on its second album (and first for In the Red), Time Bomb High School, and the group landed a high-profile gig opening for Swedish garage wunderkinds the Hives on their North American tour. Alex Greene dropped out as a full-time group member by the time 2004’s Too Much Guitar was released, though he did appear on the disc as a guest musician, and the band followed its release with more touring, both as a headliner and once again as opener for the Hives. The band also gained another well-known champion in Little Steven Van Zandt, who gave the band frequent airplay on his syndicated radio show. In September 2005 Reigning Sound released Home for Orphans through Sympathy for the Record Industry. It featured reworked versions of Too Much Guitar material along with some unreleased tracks. Listen at Last.fm NEW REIGNING SOUND LIVE LP (Goner In-Store Performance!) NOW available from GONER RECORDS, www.goner-records.com ************************************************************** ASHEVILLE, N.C Another Friday night, another rock band. Well, not just any band this is Reigning Sound, recently transplanted from Memphis to Asheville and one of the most respected outfits in the land. How respected? No less than Steve Van Zandt, he of Springsteen, Sopranos and ""Little Stevens Underground Garage,"" informed yours truly a couple of years ago that Reigning Sound was one of his fave new bands. Hives vocalist Howlin' Pelle Almqvist is so smitten that he selected the groups last album, Time Bomb High School, as one of his top picks of 2002, more recently inviting Reigning Sound to be the opening act, along with Sahara Hotnights, on the Hives upcoming U.S. tour. And in the Motor City, toasts to Reigning Sound singer/guitarist Greg Cartwright are hoisted with regularity, Jack White dropping his name in interviews and several bands going as far as to cover his songs (notably the Detroit Cobras, who reworked Cartwrights ""Bad Man"" as ""Bad Girl"" on Mink, Rat or Rabbit). All the respect in the world, however, won't buy Cartwright disaster insurance, at least not tonight in Asheville. For starters, Reigning Sound Cartwright, bassist Jeremy Scott and drummer Lance Willie, making his public debut with the band is breaking in the new trapsman in preparation for a brief European trek to promote the trios just-released Too Much Guitar! and some of the song arrangements are still decidedly rough-edged. Too, the set is plagued with gremlins, most notoriously when Scott pops a bass string during a frenetic cover of the Rationals ""Feeling Lost"" to bring things to a halt. Everyone looks around sheepishly for a moment, then Cartwright, mindful of the dead air, starts strumming his guitar and eases into a tender version of Sam Cookes ""Darling I Need You Now."" Willie takes the cue, as does Scott once hes finished restringing his axe; the volume steadily rises, the clubs emotional pulse quickens, and soon enough the bands plowing full-tilt into its meaty brand of garage n soul. As the saying goes, these guys wanna take us higher. And they do. ""Jeremy never breaks a bass string good thing that was a warm-up,"" Cartwright confides a couple of weeks later. ""Luckily in Europe, by the second show, it was great. We were firing on all cylinders. When you find the groove and you can look at the bass player and the drummer and everybody knows what the others are thinking, well, once you get it to that point, its hard to go wrong."" I'm sitting in the living room of Cartwright's two-story brick house, located in the tidy middle-class Asheville neighborhood where he and his family moved just a few months ago. Dominating one corner of the room is a massive old jukebox and a couple of guitar cases; across from it is the stereo, which Cartwright frequently steps to during the interview, spinning everything from vintage Everly Brothers and Motown to Lords Of The New Church and Eric Carmen's pre-Raspberries outfit Cyrus Erie. Lining one wall are bookcases overflowing with music biographies, while looking down upon us from another wall is a framed copy of the Big Bopper's Chantilly Lace LP. The phone rings several times: a promoter wanting to book Reigning Sound for off nights during the Hives tour, the person taking care of merch for the tour, etc. Music stuff aside, Cartwright also appears to be pretty domesticated. Family pooch Merle wanders in and out of the room, as do sons Andrew, 12, and Alex. (Alex: ""Can I get some pillows and take them into my room?"" Greg: ""Are you building a fort?"" ""Yeah."" ""OK, thats alright."") Midway through the conversation his wife Esther comes downstairs bearing 8-month old Ruby, who's decided that taking part in a big-time rock n roll interview trumps such mundane matters as her afternoon nap. (You cant make this stuff up: When daddy puts on the Motown platter, Ruby bursts into a kind of sitting down, shimmy-frugging dance.) But despite the distractions, Cartwright, quick-witted and about as forthcoming as any interview subject Ive ever grilled, keeps the ball rolling. Cartwright, of course, as a member of the Compulsive Gamblers and the notorious Oblivians, has been a fixture on the national garage scene since the early 90s. Now 34, he was born and raised in Memphis, and growing up was able to tap his fathers extensive record collection, which ran the gamut from pop (Beatles, Stones, Byrds) and early rock-n-roll (Haley, Holly, Cash, Elvis) to more underground artists such as Zappa, Beefheart, Spirit and Alice Cooper. ""But,"" says Cartwright, ""the one thing that stuck with me probably the longest was his Harry Nilsson stuff. The albums, they were really strange, you know? Kind of punk, but pretty. I remember reaching my teenage years and listening to that song: [sings] ""Youre breaking my heart, youre tearing it apart, so fuck you!"" To a kid, youre just going, Yeahhh! Curse words!"" Cartwright would get his own shot at twisting the minds of adolescents when the Oblivians issued their 1995 album Soul Food (key track: ""And Then I Fucked Her""), but in the meantime, there were high school classes to endure and bands to form. The metal and hardcore outfits of the mid-80s didnt click with Cartwright, but one punk band did, The Misfits, whose obvious indebtedness to classic 50s and 60s pop, despite the hi-energy arrangements, appealed to Cartwrights already-formed sense of melody and song structure. ""The idea about punk, for me,"" says Cartwright, ""was that you took all these classic ideas about rock and country and blues and make them more aggressive and twist them into something different and more modern. Eventually, though, I just thought I'd forget the punk thing and just do that classic stuff."" Enter the Compulsive Gamblers, which Cartwright assembled with guitarist Jack Yarber in the early 90s. The alcohol-fueled (""hangover music,"" quips Cartwright), eclectic combo lasted about three years before mutating into the Oblivians, the 2-guitar/drums/no-bass outfit whose crude, oftentimes X-rated brand of punk/skronk/blooze demolition is still discussed in awestruck tones among lo-fi garage-rock fans. More than one reviewer, in fact, has commented how, to a degree, the Oblivians may have been the Meat Puppets to the White Stripes/Hives/Strokes Nirvana. I make this observation to Cartwright. He thinks about it for a second, then grins. ""We did an Oblivians reunion gig in Memphis last Halloween and the Hives flew all the way out to see us. Someone was talking to Pelle about just that, and he said to them, No, were the Stones and the Oblivians are Howlin' Wolf!"" Cartwright scoffs, however, at those other assertions, that the Oblivians were misogynist negative creeps, comparing his bands oeuvre to the Angry Samoans earlier brand of cartoonish provocation. He's also got a touching story to go with the viewpoint: ""There was a time we went to this record store in Tuscaloosa and I was looking at the R-section. Two kids, probably about 15 or so, come in and go straight to the Os. One kid pulls out our 10"" with DLana on the cover [1994 Oblivians EP featuring a nude nubile on the sleeve] and he goes to the other kid, Look man, I told you! Ahh, man, shes so hot! Ahhhhh That record probably brought them into the store ten times in the next month, just to look at it and to show somebody: Look at this! To see that happen was pretty incredible."" From 1993-98 the Oblivians pursued their Amerindie scorched-earth policy, issuing scores of records in the process before disbanding. (Cartwright: ""Better to stop when youre having fun and still making good records. No reason to taint a good legacy."") For a couple of years the Gamblers resumed operations, Cartwright additionally releasing a solo record and producing bands. Among those hes overseen are Detroit Cobras, the Porch Ghouls, Mr. Airplane Man, the Cuts and Deadly Snakes he even joined the lineup of the latter for a short while. Then he decided to wipe the slate completely clean with Reigning Sound. While still in the Oblivians, Cartwright had begun stockpiling tunes he deemed too ""moody or melancholy"" for the band, and after selecting a bunch of mellow, folkish tunes from other songwriters (Gene Clark, Brian Wilson, Everly Brothers) he was ready to unveil his new direction a sound that Cartwright knew from the outset was guaranteed not to click with his core fan base of Oblivians aficionados. An EP plus an album, Break Up Break Down, appeared on Sympathy in 2001, and Reigning Sound was officially a go. Admits Cartwright, ""The people that liked the Oblivians, with the first Reigning Sound album, they really hated it! But you should never give people what they want give em what they need. And they needed to go out and spend eight dollars and hate it, and then two months down the road realize they like it."" 'Break Up' was followed in 2002 with Time Bomb High School (In The Red), a stylistic shift towards poppier territory that practically read like a love letter to the late, great teen garage bands of the early 60s (it included covers of Memphians the Gentrys and the Guilloteens). The new Too Much Guitar! marks another sonic detour, for while the melodies are present with much of the album recorded under live conditions theres also a seething primal, overdriven quality that just might bring lapsed Oblivians fans back into the fold. Case in point: leadoff track ""We Repel Each Other,"" which takes a ""Daytripper""-like riff and a big-beat Fleshtones-like rhythm, then rams the tune through a broken speaker cone to come out sounding like the Stones circa Got Live If You Want It! The song also boasts a line destined to become one of the all-time great teen-angst lyrics: ""Id like to touch you/ But youre surrounded by static!"" Yet crafting the Reigning Sound records to sound like a different band each time isn't an indicator of a musically perverse personality. ""You know, someone listening to Let It Be and Meet The Beatles wouldn't think that was the same band, either. Some people like 'Time Bomb' because its got all these pop hooks in it but don't like the new one because its too abrasive. But if you listen, my songwriting style hasnt changed; the hooks are all still there, still just basically pop music, its just a little more aggressive and in your face. Part of what I always try to do is make each record individual to the one before. It keeps me on my toes keeps me interested. Also, its your job as an artist and musician to test the limits of what people think they will like."" Cartwright has already told me that, among his motivations for coming to Asheville, an artsy town tucked away in the Blue Ridge Mountains, are its reputation for being a wonderful place to raise kids and the presence of a low-key but positive-feeling music scene. And with his new drummer already a resident and his bassist currently pondering the move from Memphis as well, from a professional standpoint, he's not feeling that remote. Given, however, that over the years he's also become a de facto honorary citizen of Detroit, working with bands and cultivating scores of lasting friendships there, I ask him why didnt he head north to the Motor City where career opportunities no doubt beckoned? ""Well,"" he explains, ""I'm friends, of course, with Dan and Mick and Peggy, the Gories, I've known them for a long time. And the Detroit Cobras, I produced some of their records and theyve covered some of my songs. Scott Morgan; weve played with him in the past and even backed him once. There's Eddie Kirkland, who was second lead guitar on the early John Lee Hooker stuff, weve played with him. The Gamblers backed Andre Williams, while in the Gamblers for awhile was the original Cobras bass player, Jeff Meier. I feel like I've spent so much time in Detroit, everybody who's doing anything there I've met them and been friends with them. And we actually looked at Detroit a few years ago; one of my wifes best friends lives there, and shes married to one of my good friends. A bunch of people were lobbying for us to move there, and we priced real estate, looked around, but in the end, it was more like a great place to visit and vacation and I didnt want to lose that by living there full-time. ""The thing about my records is that they are good records that have by and large gone unnoticed by the mass populace, so I haven't had to deal with a lot of attention. That keeps things right where I like it: I sell enough records so that whoever puts my record out will let me do whatever I want, but not so much attention that a major label would sign me to a contract where I have to do what they want me to do. We've had a few people call, but its always some assistant to an A&R person and inevitably what they ask is, ""So and so brought your name up and we were wondering if you could send two CDs so we could think about whether it would be something for us,"" I just go, Look, I've known A&R people, and I know you have a budget. So if you want to hear it, run out and buy it. Sending two copies to an A&R guy? You might as well set the CDs on fire. ""So I'm right where I want to be and it makes me really comfortable."" As if on cue a sudden wail from Ruby interrupts us. Shes been diligently sucking down her afternoon bottle and now nature calls. As the father of a young child myself, I've got a hunch that she needs Cartwright more right now than I do, so I gather my things, nod at Big Bopper hellooo, baby! and leave the garage rock icon to his diaper duties……. by: Fred Mills for the Metro Times in Detroit Michigan…….","<p>Founded by Memphis blues-punk legend Greg Cartwright — a former member of the Oblivians, the Compulsive Gamblers, and ‘68 Comeback — Reigning Sound fuse the hot-wired energy of garage rock with the deep emotional resonance of classic soul music in a manner that suggests a cross between the early Rolling Stones and the Sonics.

The local quintet has carved out a sweaty niche in Austin’s garage, slapping on go-go boots, igniting dance parties, and lamenting the hot death of wax through their own high energy twist and shout. 2003 saw their formation – frontman/guitarist Joe Emery, organist Jeanine Attaway, guitarist Jake Garcia, drummer Stephen Austin, and bassist Jason Gentry – from the ashes of local bands like Sir Finks and the Shakewells. The group grew out of the DJ Sue Fuzz Club parties, securing the Ugly Beats as torchbearers of the Nuggets sound and American Bandstand’s stomping grounds. 2005 brought Bring on the Beats!, and 2007 saw the debut of Take a Stand.

Crushingly melodic vocal hooks cleverly interwoven with static-filled harmonies no one’s prepared for, all executed with a snarling blow to the pleasure receptors. Their massive, almost cavernous grungy pop will escape most realistic comparisons, but as the scuzz starts to feverishly build and disseminate on each successive track of ‘Jacker,’ it becomes quickly evident that the songs that frame these livid bursts of punk energy are always worth waiting for.

This is a band that carefully divides its power, bringing the hammer down right where it needs to hit, and locking into a euphonic wave of impossibly catchy, spidery guitar lines that soar and dive with the best of ‘em so well, you’ll swear you’ve heard these chords somewhere before. What’s more is that Heavy Times have just as much of a hand on blasting your eardrums into oblivion as they do on their signature mega-melodic wall of vocals, washing like a golden glaze over each track with an enchantingly harmonic howl, that clearly defines their hyperactive Wipers-soaked sound to the core.

Listen at Last.fm Rock / Punk / Pop Punk The Dollyrots are one girl and two boys. They're a fukin punk band but their CDs are very pop. Kelly is sugar sweet but mischevious and might sucker punch you if you're dumb enough to try her patience. Which she has a lot of, if she hasn't been visiting with her friends Jack, Jim or Jameson. She likes to do girl things like grow plants and sew up her t-shirts and crochet and make strawberry cakes. But, she also likes to play her basses til they are sprinkled with blood and drives soo fast she's not allowed behind the wheel and is getting really good with the balisong she stole from her boss who used it as a letter opener. She likes to get carsick reading and send postcards from the road so send her your address or favorite book (really!). Please don't send it if you don't want The Dollyrots knocking on your door next tour looking for a floor and a shower! Then there is Luis… Luis is mysterious. And very smart. He is one of those guys who you meet and think maybe you'd join his cult. I hear he has his own religion, based on the Sun God so it's not really a stretch. Ask him about it sometime; he'll tell you about freaking that room full of people out while rambling about western religion while on some weird head trip. He is also known to get feisty when he's hungry or afraid he's getting sick. Which he seems to get all the time due to a combo weak immune system/paranoid disposition. He would like a dog when there's room for one on tour. A medium sized one like Snoopy, or maybe just a giant South American Sewage Rat.. It's really easy to get Luis to flinch, he's not crazy about people touching him. Maybe it's because he was abducted when he lived in Ecuador as a child. He likes good brit punk, music of the early 90's because it's honest and don't forget Chuck Berry and Patsy Cline. On the road he likes to read parts of books and stare out the window.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/mime-game","Mime Game","USA","","Mime Game is the long running project of singer/songwriter Dillon Teague DeVoe (formerly of Josephine Collective.) It starts as a manic trip through an insomniac’s head. A weed fueled adventure through sonic landscapes as lush and vibrant as the landscapes they were written in. This project signifies the opening of the head and heart of a man who has given himself to music since he was a kid. No illusions of grandeur. just good music.“Mime Game started humbly in my parents basement during the heydays of Josephine as a project to express another side of my musical prowess as well as an untapped facet of my heart.”The songs started with Sinkin’ and have never since ceased. “The acoustics in the bathroom of my parents basement were perfect for that tight, reverb and i could blow all my hits into the ceiling fan. It’s amazing what kind of stuff you’ll write when your heart is that open and your mind is so comfortable.”Since Mime Game’s conception, Dillon has traveled the country writing a record that has yet to see daylight. Elegantly spanning the subjects of religion (without being preachy,) death (without being morbid,) and the pitfalls and triumphs of being a performer in this day and age, he has found a formula that feels both familiar and fresh.“I’m inspired by a lot of nineties music and pop/punk. I also get down on some Tom Petty and Led Zeppelin. It makes for a really strange brew that sounds way worse than it is. Maybe that’s why we have Manchester Orchestra to thank for a whole new genre of music. Because we all grew up listening to the same shit and it’s all been really eclectic but we all had to find our own ways, individually to express ourselves through music.” “Mime Game really means a lot to me. I’ve been in a lot of bands, but this is more of a projection of my inner self then just a band. I really love this music and I really hate it too sometimes because that’s how i feel about myself. [Mime Game] is my heart on paper.” So there you have it. A sonic eclecticism that is so passionate, it could be said about it that this is a band that was made in the forges of the heart. A band for the ages. And to quote one of Mime Game’s songs, “I think I found my home. Carve a little hole out in my heart for the open road.” Luckily, it sounds like they’re coming your way.","<p>Mime Game is the long running project of singer/songwriter Dillon Teague DeVoe (formerly of Josephine Collective.)

""We approach the band differently now than we did before the hiatus. There’s no pressure on us the way we do it: We all have other sources of income, and mostly aren’t dependent on the Hips making money at shows. I think of us as ‘musicians of leisure.’"" Formed nearly 15 years ago at Chico State in Northern California, The Mother Hips have seen it all, and there are already two documentaries about them-Stories We Could Tell and This Is The Sound-to prove it. They’ve gone from dorm band to buzz band to cult favorite; they’ve taken a truckload of drugs and then kicked their habits; they’ve played with everyone from Wilco to Johnny Cash; they’ve worked with countless labels (including two albums on Rick Rubin’s American Recordings); and they’ve dealt with more industry bullshit than the average band could handle. And when singer/guitarist Greg Loiacono told his bandmates he wanted to take a break following the release of 2001’s critically acclaimed Green Hills Of The Earth, it seemed as though the Hips were on their way to getting thrown into the coulda-woulda-shoulda pile. But with the release of the band’s new seven-inch and EP on New York City upstart Camera Records, it’s clear that The Mother Hips (Bluhm, Loiacono, drummer John Hofer and bassist Paul Hoaglin) aren’t just back-they’re back with a purpose. ""Red Tandy,"" ""Blue Tomorrow"" and the EP-only ""Colonized"" are all perfect examples of the group’s ability to channel such classic bands as The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, The Band and The Beach Boys while writing thoughtful and beautiful tunes that sound just as timeless as the Hips’ inspirations. And, of course, the guys still have something to say. ""‘Colonized’ is about the human soul clashing with the incredible greed that thrives our culture,‘"" says Bluhm. ""Anything that’s cool or appealing is instantly ‘colonized’ by advertisers until we become almost afraid to express an original idea for fear that it will be used to sell fucking coffee or surf trunks."" The quartet’s first release in four years features songs-two on the vinyl, four on the CD (including an alternate version of ""Red Tandy"")-written both collaboratively and separately, and is an excellent appetizer for a new full-length LP slated to be issued next year. If the Hips sound creatively energized amidst all the harmony-drenched, California-baked rock, it’s because they are. ""Greg is my favorite person to play music with and one of my favorite songwriters,"" notes Bluhm. ""We started out together. You only have one of those guys per life. Sometimes I feel like I can’t even sing unless he’s singing with me."" ""Toward the end of 2001, it had become ‘work’ and it didn’t feel right-we were all so bitter all of the time,"" says Loiacono. ""Now when we come together to play, there’s true happiness in seeing each other, and in creating new sounds and feelings for ourselves and for the fans that come to hear us."" Though all four members remain busy with the other projects they launched during the hiatus-including Bluhm’s solo career, Loiacono and Hoaglin’s Sensations, and Bluhm and Loiacono’s Ball-Point Birds-expect plenty of activity from the Hips in the near future.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-lonely-wild","The Lonely Wild","Los Angeles, CA","rock, indie, folk","With songs that blaze through the dusty American West, quickly-rising L.A. quintet The Lonely Wild stand poised to release their debut LP, “The Sun As It Comes.” The first single from the record, “Buried In the Murder,” is a fistfight of a tune, thrusting the growl of singer Andrew Carroll against the bombastic guitar freakouts of Andrew Schneider. The track seethes with boiling tension over a backdrop of stomps, claps and screams. Carroll’s voice swells from contemplation to utter outrage as he copes with the loss of innocence and being true to himself when all the odds are stacked against him. Drawing from personal experience, the songs that make up “The Sun As It Comes” are pulled from a collection built over the past three years. In the fall of 2009, Carroll witnessed the death of his grandmother who had lost her battle with drug addiction, watched his band of six years dissolve, and at last married his longtime love. To cope with these moments of pain and bliss, Carroll began writing songs on solo, acoustic guitar. He would wake with a melody in his head, and finish a song by the end of that day. “It was a very liberating way to write,” he says, “Coming from my prior band experience, where songs were totally dependent on the collaboration of all the members, it was nice to be able to write for myself. It allowed me to be more direct and honest.” But Carroll soon realized that his songs demanded a broader palate than one guitar and one voice. He wanted to create a sepia-toned world, a cracked landscape, a wind-torn desert. Enter multi-instrumentalist Ryan Ross, whose soaring trumpet and rumbling bass and organ bring drama and tension, guitarist Andrew Schneider, whose blistering twang colors the songs with his 60’s psychedelic-western flare, and drummers Edward Cerecedes, and later Dave Farina, whose thunderous tribal beats propel the songs soul-shaking precision. Jessi Williams’ lilting croon solidifies their signature sound built around male-female vocal harmonies. Their first EP, “Dead End,” launched them on a national tour, earned them airplay on college radio staples, KXLU and KUT, and critical success. Of the EP, The L.A. Times writes, “[The Lonely Wild] rustles up rustic guitar pop that’s equal parts sweet harmonies and power chord bombast.” Kevin Bronson of Buzzbands L.A. says, “[Dead End] is five songs of aching Americana that will stay with you long after you’ve cried in your beer.” And Beat Crave writes, “The Lonely Wild have a sound like no other […] the inexplicable heart and soul they put in their music is sure to have you hooked.” Coming off the success of “Dead End,” The Lonely Wild headed to The Hangar Studios in Sacramento where they would live, eat, and sleep for a week, to record their first full-length album. Midway through the sessions, they woke to the devastating news that their head engineer’s father had died, forcing him to leave. The fate of the record seemed uncertain. A day short and with a new engineer, The Lonely Wild worked consecutive sixteen, eighteen and twenty-four hour days to produce an album filled with gut-wrenching emotion, fragile beauty, and explosive energy — a band on the brink of delirium. “It was a true labor of love,” Carroll says, “and a sheer force of will, that allowed us to finish this record. We all knew it was the most important artistic statement we had ever made, so we had to pull out all the stops.” Upon finishing the record, the band headed to SXSW 2012, and returned home for the Jubilee and Make Music Pasadena festivals. The Lonely Wild will celebrate the release of their new single, “Buried In the Murder,” this September with a residency at The Satellite. “The Sun As It Comes,” is slated for release in early 2013.","<p class=""p1"">With songs that blaze through the dusty American West, quickly-rising L.A. quintet The Lonely Wild stand poised to release their debut LP, “The Sun As It Comes.” The first single from the record, “Buried In the Murder,” is a fistfight of a tune, thrusting the growl of singer Andrew Carroll against the bombastic guitar freakouts of Andrew Schneider.

They are coming out of retirement for this young group brimming with talent, enthusiasm, and freshness” (French-Webzine “Progressia”). In a world strangled by mediocrity and distraction, Captain Squeegee leads a legacy to push the boundaries of music and bend the rules of the industry itself. Since their mysterious formation in 2003, they have allowed fate to arrange their current line-up (no original members), which has since performed hundreds of shows and festivals, released two albums, and manifested multiple music videos. Even before birthing their internationally acclaimed full length, Nothing vs Everything (2008), the band has made numerous journeys across the southwest with an intent to infect the people with their unique sound and offer something seriously different to the artistic community. Their progressive blend of multi-instrumentation and conceptualized orchestrations have been described as “Fantasia music, with lead singer Danny Torgersen making like Mickey in a swirling maelstrom of flying horns, dancing guitars, broken melodies, and mad-prophet vocalizing” (Phoenix New Times), and was even awarded “Best album of 2008” and “Best hope of 2009” by French Webzine-“Progressia”. Recently, they have paired up with the “Lucidity Web-Saga” as actors and musicians, even writing it’s theme song, “Your Own Invention”, which they recorded in a pyramid. Forever in stark contrast to the robotic, zombie infested waters of the mass media and mainstream, Squeegee will continue to offer a new age perspective, driving their fans and future fans to open the mind’s eye (and ear)… and “See More Clearly”.","<p>“The Gods of Music are not dead!

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/aaron-watson","Aaron Watson","Abilene, TX","","As one of Texas' hottest young touring acts, Aaron Watson has earned his musical stripes the hard way; on the road, traveling thousands of miles to hundreds of honky-tonks across the Southwest and beyond. And for this rising star, the payoff could not have been sweeter than one magical night this past February when he stepped on stage at the legendary Texas Hall of Fame in Bryan, TX, where so many heavyweights had stood before him, to record his latest release. For over 27 years, the Texas Hall of Fame has played host to the likes of Alan Jackson, Chris Ledoux, Gary Allan and many more. Playing before a sell-out crowd of more than 2,000 people, Aaron delivered a scorching performance that marked the culmination of a relentless touring schedule, including more than 500 shows in 11 states over two years. 800 fans were turned away that night as the venue reached capacity, but thankfully, now everyone can share in the excitement of that evening with Aaron Watsons latest release, Live At The Texas Hall of Fame. Live At The Texas Hall Of Fame is the follow-up to Aarons highly successful 2004 release The Honky Tonk Kid, which was produced by Ray Benson of Asleep at the Wheel and featured Willie Nelson. I feel like our live show is the foundation on which my career has been built, says Aaron. Since its such a big part of what we do, it was natural for the next record to be live. Fans will definitely get their moneys worth from Live At The Texas Hall Of Fame. The album features 19 songs, including ALL of his hits like Off The Record and Reckless, as well as new material. I made this album using the same philosophy that I use for my live shows. I always want to give the fans the most music and best show I can for their money, because more likely than not, they had to work hard for it says Aaron. Whats next? Rest assured that an aggressive touring schedule always tops his list. Still, no matter where he travels or how successful he gets, Aaron always stays true to his roots and the values he had when he started out. Born in Amarillo, TX and raised on country music, Aarons first musical influence came from singing old gospel hymns at church. Later, inspiration came from Willie, Waylon, Merle, George, andGeorge. While attending college at Abilene Christian University and playing baseball, Aaron began to hone his vocal and musical skills, earning his chops on the local honky-tonk circuit and developing a strong local following in the process. It was also during that time that he became serious about songwriting, collaborating often with his close friend Neal Lowry. Aaron has come a long way in a short time. A few years ago, he was traveling to gigs in a rental van with a modest 4-piece band. These days, he owns his own tour bus and shares the stage with 6 ace players in a full-blown band featuring fiddle and steel guitar. His touring base and radio airplay have extended beyond the borders of Texas to include Oklahoma, Louisiana, Wyoming, Tennessee, Kentucky, and North Carolina. With nearly 200 shows this year on the schedule, Aaron Watson is sure to play a date near you soon. If you get a chance to see him in action, it wont be hard to see why The Honky Tonk Kid is blazing such a hot trail across the country. Youll also be glad that when youre left wanting more, you can simply get in your car, turn on your stereo, and pop in a copy of Aaron Watsons new CD Live At The Texas Hall of Fame.","As one of Texas' hottest young touring acts, Aaron Watson has earned his musical stripes the hard way; on the road, traveling thousands of miles to hundreds of honky-tonks across the Southwest and beyond.

After all they formed in a Brooklyn apartment thousands of miles to the east, and their guitarist has never even seen the Pacific Ocean. There are aspects of the band’s sound—abrasive guitar hooks, immediate drumming, and incessant codas—that speak to living in a big city. But there’s also a dreary sparseness, a David Lynch-esque darkness, culled from the other members’ native Washington.Singer/songwriter Molly Hamilton grew up in an old house in Tacoma, drummer Michael Stasiak in nearby Lakewood. While grunge put Seattle on the map and Riot Grrl and the DIY aesthetic are synonymous with Olympia, Tacoma remains grittier, darker even. Infamous for the acrid smell of its paper mills, this blue-collar city somehow fosters a fertile music community—if few outsiders know about it. Michael and Molly first crossed paths in that tight-knit scene, both contributing to a local compilation label. The label lasted all of one summer before half its roster decamped for New York.There, three summers later, Michael approached Molly about starting a new band. Molly’s crippling stage fright and inexperience with the electric guitar seemed good excuses to decline, but at Michael’s urging she bought a used Danelectro and put pen to paper. Soon after, Michael invited guitarist Robert Earl Thomas to a tentative first practice. Though Robert had to plug his guitar into the stereo, and Michael played only two drums, something was palpable in that first hour. They chose a name Molly had picked months before, and Widowspeak was born.The band’s skeletal sound began to take shape, with Robert’s rust-belt guitar parts lending a restless, sinister edge to Molly’s subdued melodies and soft vocal style. Writing became a collaborative effort, and Widowspeak racked up an arsenal of songs. By fall the trio had recorded a six-track cassette using only a built-in laptop microphone and Garageband. The self-released October Tape, as it was called, fell into the hands of Brooklyn’s Captured Tracks. Weeks later, after only their sixth show, Widowspeak recorded the 7” single, “Harsh Realm,” in anticipation of a full LP.That album, recorded at Rear House with Jarvis Taveniere of Woods, documents Widowspeak’s inaugural year. In a relaxed studio setting songs born from those first jittery practices could breathe. The trio expanded their modest instrumentation while retaining a sparse aesthetic. The resulting record offers an eerie ambience, at times channeling 1950’s jukebox pop, at others, 1960’s psychedelia. While garnering comparisons to slow-moving 1990’s acts such as Mazzy Star or Cat Power, Widowspeak have defined a sound that’s earnestly nostalgic, and increasingly confident. Even so, these are songs about heartache. They are songs about homesickness, about longing for pine forests, reckless youth, and dark nights in strange cities.","<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: times, 'new york', serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16.950000762939453px; "">To say that Widowspeak is a Northwest band is to tell a half-truth.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/free-energy","Free Energy","Philadelphia, PA","indie, alternative, indie rock","There are certain bands that demand to be listened in a certain way: Pink Floyd might require a bong & lazer light show; Led Zeppelin benefits from giant, wood-paneled speakers, and FREE ENERGY—a band responsible for having crafted some of the finest guitar-filled power pop this side of Weezer or Cheap Trick—should be played on a cassette deck in a Camaro screaming down the highway; stereo cranked, feather roach clip dangling from the rearview. “Being from the Midwest definitely informed our aesthetic,” says Free Energy vocalist Paul Sprangers. “Growing up in a small town with radio and MTV—then later discovering indie rock and punk rock—really shaped the kind of music we make now. So, I had the same kind of unabashed love for Phil Collins as I did for Pavement—I don’t think I ever grew out of that. It probably shows.” The story of FREE ENERGY, however, doesn’t begin in the backseat of a muscle car, rather St. Paul, Minnesota, where Sprangers and guitarist Scott Wells—both members of the late, great Hockey Night—were signed to NYC powerhouse DFA records based on their homemade demos. After signing and spending a year writing and demoing they moved to NYC to record with James Murphy. As the record neared completion, Sprangers and Wells moved to Philly, brought in their Minnesota friends to fill out the band, and toured relentlessly behind the release of 2010’s Stuck on Nothing. While it might have seemed an odd fit for a power-riffing pop rock act to put out a record on a West Village disco label, the euphoric vibe of Free Energy—embodied in tracks like “Free Energy” and “Bang Pop”—was actually a perfect compliment to the roster of artistically different but equally accomplished bands, such as Black Dice, Yacht, The Rapture, and LCD Soundsystem. The record spawned nearly two years of solid touring and a pile of accolades, including a Best New Music nod from Pitchfork and Rolling Stone’s assessment that the band “totally fucking rules.” At a time when a lot of indie rock is mired in gloom or coated with layers of reverb, FREE ENERGY is interested in sounding like Thin Lizzy or Fleetwood Mac: old-school juggernauts that made clear, well-crafted hook-laden singalongs; songs about love, truth, and the journey within. It’s a time-tested formula, but clearly one that can still sound fresh in the right hands. “For some reason, DFA was the only label that really understood us,” says Sprangers, “They got what we were trying to do, and could hear potential in our demos. We learned so much from their philosophy, and continue to apply it to this day—it was a true education. So, after having done a record with James and DFA—which was a dream come true—it felt like a good time to push ourselves further, which turned out to be making and releasing a record ourselves.” As the band began work on album number two they flirted with a couple different producers. They cut an unreleased track with Jeff Glixman (the producer responsible for Kansas’ classic rock staple, “Dust in the Wind”) before doing a trial run with John Agnello. Agnello’s work with the likes of Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and The Hold Steady made him a good fit for the band, but it was his formative work in the 80’s with the likes of Cyndi Lauper, Hooters, and Bruce Springsteen that sealed the deal. “He really produced,” says Wells. “He came to band practices in Philly. He helped us shape the songs and get the sounds that we needed. He helped us get more clean, digital drum sounds like The Outfield used, which was a priority for us. We wanted to make the biggest, brightest rock songs we could. ” The resulting album is Love Sign, to be released on the band’s new imprint “Free Energy Records” in January of 2013. Much like it’s predecessor, the new record flirts with hysteria-inducing pop songwriting and classic rock production. Tracks like “Electric Fever,” “Hey Tonight” and “Girls Want Rock” demonstrate the band doing what they love—condensing handclaps, harmonies, fist-pumping choruses, and lazer guided guitar leads in such a way that the songs always feel vaguely familiar. These are songs that demand to be blasted in a car as one sings along at the top of one’s lungs. These are songs crafted by young men who clearly have an understanding of pop music’s DNA; the way a good melody can be more catchy than the common cold. Given their go-for-broke vibe, It makes sense that the band keeps a framed photo of Van Halen in their practice space. Ultimately, Free Energy occupy their own interesting niche. Are they an indie rock band? A classic rock band? A power pop band? Even the band isn’t sure (“I wish someone would tell us what we are,” says Sprangers, “because we’ve been described as everything!”), but in the end it doesn’t matter. The tracks on Love Sign flirt with the great themes of lasting rock music—the search for truth, falling in and out of love, and the quest for happiness—without ever sounding like retreads of a bygone era. Love Sign proves that there will always be ways to reconfigure the rock and roll archetypes into something fresh and —for lack of a better word—rocking. “When I think of great songs by Peter Gabriel, or Tom Petty, I hear the them almost like hymns. They speak to something greater than ourselves. Even the simplest rock music—songs about partying and girls—can be transcendental,” says Sprangers. “I hope people can relate to what we do on some level. I hope kids like it. I hope moms like it. I don’t care about being cool, I just want to connect. I want people to know that no matter what, life is good, and every experience is meaningful. Maybe that’s weird. But we definitely feel like weirdos and we always have…maybe we always will, which is totally fine.“","<p>There are certain bands that demand to be listened in a certain way: Pink Floyd might require a bong & lazer light show; Led Zeppelin benefits from giant, wood-paneled speakers, and <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">FREE</span> <span class=""caps"">ENERGY</span></span>—a band responsible for having crafted some of the finest guitar-filled power pop this side of Weezer or Cheap Trick—should be played on a cassette deck in a Camaro screaming down the highway; stereo cranked, feather roach clip dangling from the rearview.</p> <p>“Being from the Midwest definitely informed our aesthetic,” says Free Energy vocalist Paul Sprangers. “Growing up in a small town with radio and <span class=""caps""><span class=""caps"">MTV</span></span>—then later discovering indie rock and punk rock—really shaped the kind of music we make now.

But to Young Lyxx it is all too natural. His early acquaintance with the music industry, numerous years of recording experience, a refreshingly pure talent, his love of music, and unbridled hard work makes Young Lyxx confident that he will be able to accomplish this mission. Lennix Nelson Rogers Jr. (Young Lyxx) was born on August 16, 1989 in San Diego, California. He grew up listening to the popular sounds of the late 80s/early 90s. His family moved to New Orleans when he was just 6 years old, but this move would prove to be instrumental in his development as a rapper. He was first introduced to the music known as bounce by placing his ear to the door of his older cousin, Yorri Berrys, bedroom and listening to her rap original work in the late hours. Soon after, Lyxx began writing original work of his own. At age 11, Lyxx and his parents returned to San Diego, California. Music, always his first love, made room for a second love, basketball. During off-season, Lyxx worked diligently on his first recorded CD. He was hooked on being in the studio. By age 13, he was introduced to the stage for the first time, rounding off his experiences. The overwhelmingly positive feedback confirmed his suspicion that this is what he was born to do. He began to pursue music, vehemently. Recording on computer mics served as good practice for what was yet to come. At age 16, Lyxx linked up with other artists. Their first professionally mixed song was entitled, Wait A Minute where he was featured with Aaron TaEa$t Evans and Cairo McGee. The three clicked and eventually brought Mark Chicago Beard into the operation. Lyxx worked on an album recording with friend, James jBoy Daniels(anup and coming producer from Oceanside, California).jBoyintroduced Lyxx to Pro-Tools. From there Lyxx picked up his own unique recording habits. Lyxx acceptance to Clark-Atlanta University forced a move to the Peachtree state. Juggling the demands of college, a thriving social life, and a rap career was made a little easier because of: • the mentorship he received from rapper and former NFL player Reggie Famouz Stephens, • his work ethic instilled by his loving parents Lennix Sr. and Kim, • his sheer determination to succeed, • the constant study of his craft Young Lyxx states, being perfect is impossible, but I want to be as close as I can get. Lyxx plans to introduce a new sound to the industry and with a successful mixtape (Rosaries On The Dresser), climaxing to 1M+ plays on Myspace, multiple shows with other up and coming artist such as, B.O.B., J. Cole, Mickey Factz, Donnis, Big Krit, Nefu Da Don, Wiz Khalifa, Dom Kennedy, and others, a strong team behind him (Top Heavy U.), support from clothing lines such as Chilly-O, Fli Pelican, Rock Smith Tokyo, and others, he is confident that his music is ready to be heard by the discerning ears of the world. His musical impact in Atlanta has also caught the attention of BROKE AND BOUJEE’s own “Fadia Kader.” Broke and Boujee is a five year old party going strong between Atlanta and Chicago for some of the best musicians, artist, clothing labels and “it” girls and boys. “When I make my way into the game, Im bringing my bags to settle in, because Im not going nowhere.” His enthusiasm topped off with talent makes all those who have come into contact with him, BELIEVE that he is here to stay!","<p>Being a California kid and infusing a new sound into the south may be a seemingly difficult task.

Hailing from Atlanta, the South’s renowned music capital, Tez has established himself as a multi-talented artist with a natural, charismatic stage presence. Since parting ways with his former rap group and adopting the nickname “Brand Name”, as a solo artist Tez McClain’s popularity has been steadily on the rise. Tez has claimed titles at several talent showcases while performing at many popular venues in the Southeast. After captivating the ears of some of Atlanta’s industry elite, Tez began working with accomplished producers and executives including DTP’s Chaka Zulu, LT-Moe, Maestro and Focus. The rapper’s first single, “I’m Fly” garnered regional attention, leading to appearances on a variety of mixtapes and consistent club plays. “I’m Fly” eventually won the Hot 107.9 Battleground contest so many consecutive times that it officially retired with the title of Battleground Champion, with Tez achieving the same title again in 2009 for “Booty Call.” Tez went on to have two appearances on MTV’s Sucker Free Sunday’s, and ultimately won the Mountain Dew Sucker Free Challenge – all while attending college full-time. After graduating, Tez released his mixtape, Wishful Thinking Vol. 1, alongside fellow CAU alumnus, DJ Don Cannon. Getting rave reviews and write ups, Wishful Thinking Vol. 1 was featured on several blogs and websites such as XXLMag.com, HipHopdx.com, AllHipHop.com, and SlamOnline.com, among others. Unconstrained, the Atlanta-native performed on stages across the nation during the Back to the Future Tour opening for Opio (of legendary group Souls of Mischief) and Bay Area artist Mistah F.A.B. Tez’s latest single, “Jordans & and Gold Chain” further declares his “Brand Name.” Reaping thousands of views and listens, the song is a glaring example of Tez’s ability to deliver contemporary messages in a way that continues to appeal to fans. “I like to have an emotional connection with my listeners. I want to talk to them like I know what they’re going through. I believe that, in an emotional aspect, everybody goes through the same things. Everybody’s felt shame, love, happiness, guilt, doubt, and lust.” Tez is presently working on his next mixtape, Wishful Thinking Vol. 2: Respect My Grind (RMG). The mixtape, to be released in early 2012, will feature G.O.O.D Music’s Cyhi The Prynce, among others. In 2012, Tez McClain is sure to flood the scene as he upholds his trademark as a brand name.","<p>Cortez an undeniably gifted artist, Cortez “Tez” McClain has been grabbing the attention of music’s most prominent figures since his youth.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/dayna-kurtz","Dayna Kurtz","Brooklyn, NY","singer-songwriter, jazz, female vocalists","In April of last year, New Jersey native Dayna Kurtz escaped to the desert to write the songs for her fourth album. ""I completed most of the songs for Another Black Feather in a hermitage maintained by some lovely people for solitary religious introspection. I stayed in an adobe hut on 500 acres in the Sonoran desert in Arizona. There was no electricity, nobody around for miles, a cot, a table, chair and pitcher. 2 weeks. I brought no distractions – no novels, only books of writing exercises and poetry. It was so quiet at night I could hear the blood beat in my ears. It was sublime, and I wrote constantly. When I wasn’t writing I’d take a walk, stop and watch a bug climbing around a desert flower for an hour. I learned a lot about my friends when I described this trip to them, and showed them pictures. My artist/writer/musician friends were mostly envious. But some people looked at the hut and said, ‘Is that a dirt floor?’” Making the album came just as easily. “We recorded the basics live to tape, 2 or 3 takes per song, and picked the best of ‘em right then. I love analog. When you record digitally it just requires too much imagination to hear how good it might sound when you’ve overdubbed, mixed and mastered. When you record to tape, it sounds like a record right out of the gate. It helped us make decisions faster – we just knew when it was good or great or bad, not based on the perfection of performance, but based on overall vibe.” “It was the best of both worlds; the warmth and immediacy of analog with the final flexibility of pro-tools. I’m never recording any other way again.”Co-producing the album with Dayna was Randy Crafton, who has worked with Dayna on all 3 of her studio albums. Some of the musicians who helped Dayna bring her songs to life include her long-time back up band, bassist Dave Richards and keyboard/accordionist Peter Vitalone, the singer-songwriter Malcolm Holcombe, Matt Darriau and Frank London from the Klezmatics, Jorge Alfano (charango), Rob Curto (accordion), and Danny Bensi, Saunder Jurriaans and Gregory Rogove from the band Tarantula AD. ”Dave, Randy, Pete and I are turning into a really crack studio machine lately. Both Randy and Dave have started families in the last couple of years, so they really can’t get on the road with me all that often anymore. It’s made us really appreciate our time in the studio that much more. They’re family now, and we play like it. They know my quirks as a player so well that we barely have to discuss what’s going on, they’re just right there. I played a lot of lap steel for the first time on this record. It’s a completely different feel than regular old slide guitar – you have to keep it very simple, to the point, and it’s unforgiving on intonation. I keep on wanting to invent studio projects for us so I don’t have to wait till I’ve written an album full of songs to get back there with them. I want to find someone who wants us as a backing band, so I can just play lap steel guitar for hours with these guys. I wish we could be Booker T and the MG’s, and find our Bill Withers to produce and back up.""Following in the footsteps of the diverse Beautiful Yesterday, Another Black Feather finds Dayna leaning more heavily on her roots and country influences than usual, in particular making generous use of her new lap steel guitar, and showcasing her prodigious slide work on other songs. “One of the things that I seem to encounter constantly is that I don’t really quite fit anywhere,” observes Dayna Kurtz. Asked by a European journalist what her music was ‘made of’, Dayna replied, “If you’re at the flea market, you walk past all the fine old antiques and the cheap designer knockoff clothing from China, past the used German leather jackets, and over in the back is an old man with a battered tweed hat who has some blankets on the ground covered with old toasters and a pair of ladies knickers from the 50’s, a snow globe from the 1992 Olympic games, and a box of old men’s watches and broken reading glasses and teaspoons. I’ll be picking through there.”The lack of a ready stylistic tag hasn’t stopped the resourceful performer from building a substantial audience—and a compelling body of recorded work—on her own terms. She maintains an enthusiastic international fan base that’s embraced the poetic passion of her songwriting and the communicative power of her voice, an unforgettable, distinctly husky instrument that’s capable of immense depth and sensitivity. She has also inspired reams of rapturous acclaim from critics and won admiration from her musical peers.Dayna Kurtz began performing her original compositions in public as a teenager, and subsequently spent the better part of a decade touring solo across the back roads of America, selling CD’s out of her trunk and mesmerizing club and festival crowds with her riveting live performances. Along the way, she opened shows for the likes of Richie Havens (who became a fan and lent guest vocals to her debut studio album, Postcards from Downtown). The last few years has found Dayna winning over new fans in the New York City music scene. In the past two years she has been invited to open up for Rufus Wainwright, Antony & the Johnsons, and Keren Ann. Additionally, Dayna has won over fellow “Living Room” habitué Norah Jones, who sings a duet with Dayna on “I Got It Bad…” (From Beautiful Yesterday). Outside of her new hometown, the legendary Richard Thompson invited Dayna to open up for a coast-to-coast nationwide tour that found Dayna converting some of his faithful fans. The fan response and critical attention generated by Kurtz’s grass roots touring efforts inevitably drew interest from the mainstream music industry. Despite her indie status, Dayna has found an enthusiastic audience, winning high-profile guest spots on such radio shows as World Cafe, Mountain Stage and NPR’s Morning Edition. But nowhere has the interest in Dayna’s music been more pronounced than in Holland, where Dayna’s debut studio album soared into the top 20 of the album charts on the strength of the hit single “Love Gets in the Way”. In the summer of 2003, Dayna went from performing in front of 50 people at the Living Room in New York City’s lower east side, to headlining the fabled Paradiso theatre in Amsterdam in front of 1000 people in what would be her first of many sold out shows in the Netherlands in the months to follow. Dayna has since then discovered a larger audience in Europe, and this spring alone will find her in Greece, Spain, Germany, Belgium and the UK. But Dayna Kurtz has worked too hard to allow such adulation to go to her head. “Every step I’ve taken has felt really organic, and like they’ve been made at the right time,” she states, adding, “The records I’ve made feel like honest expressions of where I’m at musically, and the making of them has been joyful and interesting.”“Besides, every musician should feel like a rock star in at least one country.”","<p>In April of last year, New Jersey native Dayna Kurtz escaped to the desert to write the songs for her fourth album.

My artist/writer/musician friends were mostly envious. But some people looked at the hut and said, ‘Is that a dirt floor?’” <br><br>Making the album came just as easily. “We recorded the basics live to tape, 2 or 3 takes per song, and picked the best of ‘em right then. I love analog. When you record digitally it just requires too much imagination to hear how good it might sound when you’ve overdubbed, mixed and mastered. When you record to tape, it sounds like a record right out of the gate. It helped us make decisions faster – we just knew when it was good or great or bad, not based on the perfection of performance, but based on overall vibe.” <br><br>“It was the best of both worlds; the warmth and immediacy of analog with the final flexibility of pro-tools. I’m never recording any other way again.”<br><br>Co-producing the album with Dayna was Randy Crafton, who has worked with Dayna on all 3 of her studio albums. Some of the musicians who helped Dayna bring her songs to life include her long-time back up band, bassist Dave Richards and keyboard/accordionist Peter Vitalone, the singer-songwriter Malcolm Holcombe, Matt Darriau and Frank London from the Klezmatics, Jorge Alfano (charango), Rob Curto (accordion), and Danny Bensi, Saunder Jurriaans and Gregory Rogove from the band Tarantula AD. <br><br><br>”Dave, Randy, Pete and I are turning into a really crack studio machine lately. Both Randy and Dave have started families in the last couple of years, so they really can’t get on the road with me all that often anymore. It’s made us really appreciate our time in the studio that much more. They’re family now, and we play like it. They know my quirks as a player so well that we barely have to discuss what’s going on, they’re just right there. I played a lot of lap steel for the first time on this record. It’s a completely different feel than regular old slide guitar – you have to keep it very simple, to the point, and it’s unforgiving on intonation. I keep on wanting to invent studio projects for us so I don’t have to wait till I’ve written an album full of songs to get back there with them. I want to find someone who wants us as a backing band, so I can just play lap steel guitar for hours with these guys. I wish we could be Booker T and the MG’s, and find our Bill Withers to produce and back up.""<br><br>Following in the footsteps of the diverse Beautiful Yesterday, Another Black Feather finds Dayna leaning more heavily on her roots and country influences than usual, in particular making generous use of her new lap steel guitar, and showcasing her prodigious slide work on other songs. “One of the things that I seem to encounter constantly is that I don’t really quite fit anywhere,” observes Dayna Kurtz. Asked by a European journalist what her music was ‘made of’, Dayna replied, “If you’re at the flea market, you walk past all the fine old antiques and the cheap designer knockoff clothing from China, past the used German leather jackets, and over in the back is an old man with a battered tweed hat who has some blankets on the ground covered with old toasters and a pair of ladies knickers from the 50’s, a snow globe from the 1992 Olympic games, and a box of old men’s watches and broken reading glasses and teaspoons. I’ll be picking through there.”<br><br>The lack of a ready stylistic tag hasn’t stopped the resourceful performer from building a substantial audience—and a compelling body of recorded work—on her own terms. She maintains an enthusiastic international fan base that’s embraced the poetic passion of her songwriting and the communicative power of her voice, an unforgettable, distinctly husky instrument that’s capable of immense depth and sensitivity. She has also inspired reams of rapturous acclaim from critics and won admiration from her musical peers.<br><br>Dayna Kurtz began performing her original compositions in public as a teenager, and subsequently spent the better part of a decade touring solo across the back roads of America, selling CD’s out of her trunk and mesmerizing club and festival crowds with her riveting live performances. Along the way, she opened shows for the likes of Richie Havens (who became a fan and lent guest vocals to her debut studio album, Postcards from Downtown). <br><br>The last few years has found Dayna winning over new fans in the New York City music scene. In the past two years she has been invited to open up for Rufus Wainwright, Antony & the Johnsons, and Keren Ann. Additionally, Dayna has won over fellow “Living Room” habitué Norah Jones, who sings a duet with Dayna on “I Got It Bad…” (From Beautiful Yesterday). Outside of her new hometown, the legendary Richard Thompson invited Dayna to open up for a coast-to-coast nationwide tour that found Dayna converting some of his faithful fans. <br><br>The fan response and critical attention generated by Kurtz’s grass roots touring efforts inevitably drew interest from the mainstream music industry. Despite her indie status, Dayna has found an enthusiastic audience, winning high-profile guest spots on such radio shows as World Cafe, Mountain Stage and NPR’s Morning Edition. But nowhere has the interest in Dayna’s music been more pronounced than in Holland, where Dayna’s debut studio album soared into the top 20 of the album charts on the strength of the hit single “Love Gets in the Way”. In the summer of 2003, Dayna went from performing in front of 50 people at the Living Room in New York City’s lower east side, to headlining the fabled Paradiso theatre in Amsterdam in front of 1000 people in what would be her first of many sold out shows in the Netherlands in the months to follow. Dayna has since then discovered a larger audience in Europe, and this spring alone will find her in Greece, Spain, Germany, Belgium and the UK. <br><br>But Dayna Kurtz has worked too hard to allow such adulation to go to her head. “Every step I’ve taken has felt really organic, and like they’ve been made at the right time,” she states, adding, “The records I’ve made feel like honest expressions of where I’m at musically, and the making of them has been joyful and interesting.”<br><br>“Besides, every musician should feel like a rock star in at least one country.” <br></p> </div>","http://s3.amazonaws.com/dostuff-production/photos/7501793/9108de8f325907c670c15f8f66db8f97_poster.jpeg","http://www.youtube.com/e/pSvK7csq9_4?enablejsapi=1&version=3"

On the edge of The Great Dismal Swamp, Hardesty developed his spirit of adventure, and passion for doing things a bit differently. His father, Dan gave him a guitar when he was two, and later told him, “It doesn’t matter if you play it right, just make it sound good!” Not the typical teaching method, but then again, The Last Bison is anything but typical.The seven-member ensemble led by Ben has seemingly risen from the marshes of southeastern Virginia to captivate the national music scene with a rare blend of folk that is poetically steeped in classical influences. Band members describe the sound as “mountain-top chamber.”Already the band has drawn flattering though imperfect comparisons to indie rock superstars the likes of Mumford & Sons, The Decemberists and Fleet Foxes. Flattering because each of those bands has carried folk rock into the mainstream; imperfect because none of them have a front man that shares the stage with his father and sister, nor uses a 75-year-old chaplain’s pump organ and Bolivian goat toenails on stage. The Last Bison is a tight knit community of family and friends that boasts a sound all its own.A blogger for the popular music sharing site, Noise trade, remarked: “Bison has already crafted a sound that is threaded with their own singular strands of creativity. Songs like ‘In Your Room,’ ‘Switzerland,’ ‘The Woodcutter’s Son’ and ‘River Rhine’ all unfurl in textured, poetic waves that are based far more in inspiration than imitation.”Another critic, for Folk hive, writes: “Bison is a welcome respite from all that is manufactured.”Ben appears every bit the man to lead such an outfit. His husky frame and thick facial hair match his gravelly yet soulful voice. He drives a 1989 wood-paneled station wagon – the muffler fell off during an off-road escapade – and he brews mead in his family’s kitchen.He’s joined by a cast of family and close friends – drawing authenticity from many nights spent jamming around backyard bonfires, spontaneously creating music in the living room, and leading songs with the extended community at their local church.The Last Bison’s live shows transport audiences from urban music halls to another, less familiar, era. Rich melodies accent unabashedly spiritual lyrics. Traditional folk instruments resonate with unexpected arrangements –sharing the musical space with lush family harmonies, classical strings, and earthy percussion. Band members appear to have stepped out of an 18th century stagecoach. The look hints at the band’s roots in colonial Virginia, while the sound transcends a defining era.Six of the band’s seven members are the products of homeschooling, including Ben and his younger sister, Annah, who plays bells and sings backup vocals. A couple of longtime friends – percussionist Jay Benfante and his older brother, Andrew, who rocks that antique organ – grew up going to church with the Hardesty’s and were a natural fit.

Early supporters of Giraffage’s screwed-down soundscapes, sample-based pop music and future R&B include such publications as Pitchfork, XLR8R, The Fader and Gorilla vs. Bear. After an extensive tour with the artist xxyyxx through Europe last year, Giraffage has big plans for 2013, with numerous upcoming performance dates including a Brooklyn Vegan showcase at SXSW and at Los Angeles’ world-renowned Low End Theory club night.

An anomaly within the generally misogynist late-‘90s Dirty South rap scene, Gangsta Boo won substantial acclaim among audiences without sacrificing her pride. As the sole female & an original member of Memphis, TN, hardcore rap group Three 6 Mafia, she had held her own; it wasn’t until her debut album, though, that she really started garnering an unprecedented amount of attention. Her first solo album, Enquiring Minds, was released in 1998 and reached number fifteen on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 46 on the Billboard 200. Enquiring Minds found Gangsta Boo confronting the lyrical issues that hardcore female rappers such as Lil’ Kim have to address: sexual politics, money hungry stereotypes, proving that a female can be hardcore, and so on. Enquiring Minds spawned the national anthem “Where Dem Dollas At!?” and helped to build the national stage for the Memphis music scene that was about to come. After the success of Enquiring Minds, she played a critical role in the multi-platinum success of Three 6 Mafia’s When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1 in 2000. She left the group following the release of their album When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1. Her 2001 album, Both Worlds *69, reached number eight on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart and number 29 on the Billboard 200. It featured the hit singles “Love Don’t Live (U Abandoned Me)” and “Can I Get Paid (Stripper’s Anthem).” Her third album, Enquiring Minds II: Soap Opera, released in 2003, peaked at number 53 on the R&B/Hip-Hop chart and 24 on the Top Independent Albums. The album spawned the street hit “Sippin & Spinnin’” and the remix with Bun B has turned into a staple in her music catalog. Boo released the album under her new record label “Crazy Lady Entertainment.” The album was also the first teaming of her and producer Drumma Boy whom have since created a musical bond. Gangsta Boo has also been collaborating with many artists in the rap industry over the past several years. She was featured on Lil Jon & The Eastside boy’s 2004 multi-platinum smash “Crunk Juice” on the underground hit “Da Blow.” She was featured on OutKast’s 2000album, “Stankonia.” Ludacris’ 2005 album “Disturbing The Peace.” Pastor Troy’s 2007 “Tool Muziq,” plus countless others that you can find on Google. She also teamed up with Nick Scarfo for the Prophet Posse reunion and been featured on their last three albums, “The Return, Pt. 1,” “The Return: Part 2 Belly of The Beast,” and “Hood U.S.A.” She also has released several mixtapes over the past few years including, “Street Ringers: Volumes 1 & 2,” “Still Gangsta: The Memphis Queen Is Back,” & “Gangsta Rock.” Gangsta Boo has just released a new digital single to iTunes and Amazon called “Miss.Com.” She also released the “Miss.Com” mixtape in December of 2010, and it is available for free download at Livemixtapes.com","<p>Gangsta Boo was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/james-cotton","James Cotton","Tunica, MS","","Over the course of his storied career, Cotton has seemingly done it all. As a small boy he learned harmonica directly from Sonny Boy Williamson. He toured with Howlin’ Wolf, recorded for Sun Records, and spent twelve years with Muddy Waters before stepping out on his own. Leading his own band, he rose to the very top of blues and rock scenes, touring the world non-stop and earning his reputation as one of the most powerful live blues performers in the world. Cotton is one of the few bluesmen to have the power to literally suck the reeds out of the harmonica from the pure force of his playing. He brings that power back to Alligator Records with his new CD, GIANT, a ferocious blast of brash boogie blues. Produced by Cotton, Jacklyn Hairston and Derek O’Brien and recorded by Stuart Sullivan at Wire Recording in Austin, Texas, GIANT features twelve tracks, including four new Cotton originals and co-writes, alongside songs made famous by Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Ivory Joe Hunter and others. Throughout his career, Cotton has always led great bands, and the players on GIANT are no exception. With guitarists/vocalists Slam Allen and Tom Holland, bassist Noel Neal and drummer Kenny Neal, Jr., GIANT is not just a reminder of Cotton’s legendary status, it is a vibrant, hard-hitting album made by one of the true blues masters. Born in Tunica, Mississippi on July 1, 1935, Cotton actually grew up on a cotton plantation. The youngest of eight brothers and sisters, he received a fifteen-cent harmonica for Christmas as a very small boy and mastered it almost immediately. He began listening to Sonny Boy Williamson’s “King Biscuit Time” broadcasting from Helena, Arkansas on KFFA, and learned to imitate the older bluesman note for note. In 1944, after both of Cotton’s parents had passed away, his uncle took the nine-year-old boy to Helena to meet his hero. The child’s talent amazed Sonny Boy, who took the boy under his wing, and Cotton spent many nights traveling with Williamson to juke joints all over the area. Too young to enter the clubs, the youngster often played for tips outside, sometimes drawing crowds to rival Sonny Boy’s. When Williamson left for Milwaukee in 1950, Cotton, now 15, took over Sonny Boy’s band. While this arrangement didn’t last beyond a few gigs, Cotton got his first taste of band leading. He then joined Howlin’ Wolf’s band, touring with him all over the South. Cotton learned all about the road from Wolf, and, though only a teenager, he was determined to make a name for himself. By 1952 he had moved to West Memphis, gigging often in local juke joints and clubs and, along with drummer Willie Nix, hosting a local radio show sponsored by Hart’s Bread (“No way for you not to know it ’cause the red heart is there to show it.”). In 1953, the teenage Cotton received word that Sun Records owner Sam Phillips wanted to record him. He cut a total of four sides for Sun in 1953-54, including the classic “Cotton Crop Blues.” In 1954, Muddy Waters came through Memphis without Junior Wells, his harp player at the time. Waters was well aware of Cotton’s rising reputation and asked the young harpslinger to join his band. Cotton headed to Chicago with Waters, staying by his side for over a decade, becoming Muddy’s trusted confidante and the leader of his backing band. The first few years Cotton was with Waters, Chess Records still insisted on having Little Walter record with Muddy. But that changed beginning in 1958, when Cotton joined Waters in the studio, recording on many of Muddy’s later classics sides, including “She’s 19 Years Old and Close To You.” Cotton convinced Waters to perform and record “Got My Mojo Working,” and can be heard playing on the definitive version of the song on Waters’ 1960 Chess LP, LIVE AT NEWPORT. By 1966, Cotton was ready to head out on his own. He first recorded album sides under his own name for the CHICAGO/THE BLUES/TODAY! series on Vanguard, and along with Otis Spann, cut “The Blues Never Die!” for Prestige. He made his first solo albums— three for Verve and one for Vanguard — in the late 1960s, with bands featuring outstanding musicians, including famed guitarist Luther Tucker and master drummers Sam Lay and Francis Clay. With his gale-force sound and fearless boogie band (later featuring Matt “Guitar” Murphy), it wasn’t long before he was adopted by the burgeoning hippie audience as one of their own. Cotton shared stages with Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, B.B. King, Santana, Steve Miller, Freddie King and many others. In 1969 he appeared on Hugh Hefner’s groundbreaking PLAYBOY AFTER DARK syndicated television program. Cotton was universally renowned as one of the hardest-touring and most popular blues artists of the 1970s. His acrobatic showmanship (he often did somersaults on stage) and full-throttle blues kept him in demand at concert halls all over the country. He played the Fillmore East in New York, the Fillmore West in San Francisco and every major rock and blues venue in between. During the decade, he cut an album for Capitol and three for Buddah. He rejoined his old boss Muddy Waters for the series of Muddy albums produced by Johnny Winter, starting with HARD AGAIN in 1977. Cotton also guested on recordings by Koko Taylor and many others. He was joined on his own albums by stars like Todd Rundgren, Steve Miller and Johnny Winter. Cotton joined Alligator Records in 1984, releasing HIGH COMPRESSION and LIVE FROM CHICAGO: MR. SUPERHARP HIMSELF!!! (which earned him the first of his four Grammy nominations). In 1990 he joined fellow Chicago harp masters for the all-star release HARP ATTACK!. He won a Grammy Award in 1996 for his Verve album, DEEP IN THE BLUES, was inducted into the Blues Hall Of Fame in 2006, and the Smithsonian Institution has honored Cotton by adding one of his harmonicas to their permanent collection. During the 2000s Cotton has continued recording and touring relentlessly, playing clubs, concert halls and festivals all over the world, electrifying audiences wherever he performs. Today, while turning over the singing duties to his road band, Cotton can still blow the reeds right out of a harp. GIANT reaffirms James Cotton’s high-compression blues harmonica playing is a true force of nature. As THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER says, “James Cotton is an inimitable blues legend. His wailing harmonica blows them away. His improvisations on the blues are full of fun and good humor. The blues don’t get much better.” In June 2010, Cotton was honored at New York’s Lincoln Center, where his friends Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins, Taj Mahal, Shemekia Copeland and others paid tribute in an all-star concert. There James Cotton played to yet another sold-out venue, with fans cheering the man known worldwide as “Mr. Superharp,” an undisputed giant of the blues.","<p>Over the course of his storied career, Cotton has seemingly done it all.

THEY BROKE UP. THEY WROTE SONGS. at a time when for most it would be the end of a relationship, for The Falls this feels like just the beginning… Almost subconsciously The Falls have documented their whole relationship in their songs. The love, the betrayal, the heartbreak. While at times it is hard for them to wear their hearts so openly on their sleeve, for The Falls, it has been a huge part of their songwriting. As Stevie Nicks said “devastation leads to writing good things”. In the fallout from Valentines Day, The Falls decided that rather than wallowing in self-pity they would put their heartbreak to tape. So they pulled out their little tascam 4-track portastudio, which, with all its tape wobbles and noise, aptly captured the fragility of their hearts. These fledgling recordings were just the beginning of what has become their debut EP ‘HOLLYWOOD’ (out now through MGM Distribution). In late 2011, The Falls hit the studio with producer Tony Buchen (Old Man River, Andy Bull, WIM, Washington) to record ‘Hollywood’. The Hotel Hollywood in Sydney, has featured so strongly in their lives that it was inevitable that it would manifest itself in this way. For most of 2010 and 2011, it was where they could be found playing each week at a little, somewhat undiscovered, night of free music that emerged from the back streets of Surry Hills called Folk Club. It is also where they met, where they found their sound and where they wrote these songs. In this intimate setting, the connection between these two onstage was palpable. Their emotionally fueled live performances are compelling to watch, sometimes heartbreakingly so, garnering reviews such as “intoxicating melodies and gorgeous harmonies” and “(their) strength lies in their ability to convey raw emotion and wisdom in their lyrics”. Buchen managed to imprint some of this Hollywood magic on each track, recording the re-verbs for the EP down in the bowels of the hotel, in the downstairs men’s toilets. So, each song has on it a little Hollywood porcelain re-verb or ‘pee-verb’ as they’ve been calling it. Having toured nationally this year with Of Monsters And Men (Iceland), Passenger (UK) and Avalanche City (NZ), The Falls are fast developing a very impressive live resume which also includes performances at the Surry Hills Festival, Peat’s Ridge Art and Music Festival, Gulgong Folk Festival and Nunnup Music Festival, as well as shows with Lior, Husky and Georgia Fair. The Falls have also showcased at APRA’s Song Summit 2012, BIGSOUND 2012 in Brisbane and have recently been invited to showcase at Canadian Music Fest in 2013 and are excited to be heading to Canada and the USA next year. Having also shared the stage with one of their idles Graham Nash, when he was in Australia on tour with Crosby, Stills & Nash, The Falls have had an incredible year. With an unmistakable sound, barefoot collaborators and best friends The Falls are gently making a name for themselves in 2012 “Beautiful harmonies, sweet as lyrics, warmth all round. I really love this. Those voices climb and soar so sweetly, and that toy piano comes in at just the right moment. A+.” - Zan Rowe, triple j (5/5) “the voices sit next to each other like they’ve been pouring from the same pot of tea for years and some judiciously deployed extras like strings and tuned percussion alongside the voices and the Falls – the duo of Simon Rudston-Brown and Melinda Kirwin –could earn a place on the same stage as the Civil Wars.” - Bernard Zuel, The Sydney Morning Herald “The debut EP Hollywood, is a cracker of a folk collection, a six-track taste of what these kids are capable of – it will certainly leave you wanting more.” - Rip It Up (4 ½ stars) http://triplejunearthed.com/THEFALLS http://musicfromthefalls.com/ http://www.youtube.com/user/videofromthefalls","<p><span class=""caps"">THE</span> <span class=""caps"">FALLS</span>.</p> <p><span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">MET</span>. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">FELL</span> IN <span class=""caps"">LOVE</span>. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">WROTE</span> <span class=""caps"">SONGS</span>.<br /> <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">FOUGHT</span>. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">MADE</span> UP. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">BROKE</span> UP. <span class=""caps"">THEY</span> <span class=""caps"">WROTE</span> <span class=""caps"">SONGS</span>.</p> <p>at a time when for most it would be the end of a relationship, for The Falls this feels like just the beginning…</p> <p>Almost subconsciously The Falls have documented their whole relationship in their songs.

The addition of Andrew on drums proved extremely beneficial to the group’s music, giving them a rock based genre and a much more energetic live set-up.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/canyons","Canyons","","","Canyons’ musical ensemble is hard to define. A theory of opposites attracting, a burgeoning front of beautiful contradictions. Their inspiration exists somewhere between sand dunes and icebergs, volcanoes and valleys, fiction and fact. Musically, Canyons never claim genres and more importantly, they don’t adhere to stereotypes. Striking the elusive balance between creativity, originality and pop sensibility, with an aural likeness to elements of psych, folk, house and everything deep, what is essential to Canyons is that their music evokes a sense of feeling and truth. Canyons’ story is one of intrigue and mystery, one that can be traced back to the Nether Valley in the outer regions of the Western Australian landscape. Ryan Grieve and Leo Thomson began making music separately, under various guises, before coming together as Canyons. ‘Hole in the Sky’, the record label the two founded together, was their initial musical point of contact and the coming together of their creative minds. The label’s first release garnered two pieces of music individually crafted by Leo and Ryan, but it wasn’t until the label’s second release; ‘the Lovemore EP’, that their combined sound manifested, and the name Canyons was born. Interestingly release number three was the debut EP from a little known Perth band named Tame Impala. The two went on to remix the likes of Ladyhawke, the Juan Maclean, !!! and of course, Tame Impala, causing a stir at home which was loudly echoed across the pond in the US and Europe. So much so that the band went on to release “Blue Snakes” on esteemed Parisian Label ‘I’m a Cliché’, closely followed by their deep, jamming epic, “Fire Eyes” on the coveted DFA Records. Not a band to rest on their laurels, Canyons then signed with Australian label Modular and began recording their debut album in the zoo-like, sound ranch they call home in inner-city Sydney. Taking a musical approach guided by intuition and feel, Canyons have forged their own identity amongst a sea of comers, goers and imitators. They traverse the obvious comparisons to whatever is on the radio right now, focusing on creating original music that could be from the past, present or future. Canyons unleash the first taste from their debut album in the form of ‘My Rescue’. The track is an ode to the sun, enlightenment. It is positivity and musical freedom at its very best. Close your eyes, feel the sun on your face, dance inside and out… Prepare yourselves for the sonic vision that is Canyons.","<p>Canyons’ musical ensemble is hard to define.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/skylar-grey","Skylar Grey","Mezomaine, WI","alternative, female vocalists, alternative rock","Skylar Grey is a singer/songwriter whose recent breakout performance on the GRAMMY Awards alongside Dr. Dre and Eminem for their newest single, “I Need A Doctor,” has elevated her into the spotlight, beyond her writing credits, as a phenomenal, critically-acclaimed singer. In addition to “I Need a Doctor,” which she also wrote, Grey can currently be heard on several tracks for songs that she penned including Lupe Fiasco’s “Words I Never Said,” and Diddy Dirty Money’s “Coming Home.” The recent GRAMMY performance is just one of many milestone moments in what has been a whirlwind year for Grey, who was also nominated for two GRAMMY Awards that evening for “Song of the Year” and “Best Rap Song,” for writing Eminem and Rihanna’s “Love the Way You Lie.” A fateful introduction by Grey’s publisher at Universal to producer extraordinaire Alex Da Kid via email, lead to the pair writing their first song together, “Love the Way You Lie.” “I didn’t write it with Rihanna in mind, I just wrote what I felt over the beat, thinking that I would sing it,” said Grey. “I felt honored that Eminem was drawn to the song because I’ve always respected him as an artist.” Grey went on to write Rihanna’s Part II and Part III of the same song for Rihanna’s Loud album. Grey and Alex de Kid have since become a duo to be reckoned with in the world of song writing. In addition to Fiasco’s controversial “Words I Never Said,” and Diddy Dirty Money’s “Home,” Grey is also credited with writing “Castle Walls” for TI, featuring Christina Aguilera. Even prior to her captivating GRAMMY performance, buzz about Grey as a singer had begun to pique in the last couple months, following a release of her original demo of “Love the Way You Lie” on AOL, which quickly became an online hit. The release lined up with the Dr. Dre and Eminem single, “I Need a Doctor,” from Dr. Dre’s long awaited Detox album hitting radio and a leak of Fiasco’s “Words I Never Said” from his forthcoming Lasers album, all of which subsequently found Grey as a #2 trending topic on twitter worldwide, a feat she also accomplished the night of her GRAMMY performance. Grey was born and raised in a tiny village in Wisconsin and has been performing since the age of 6. She left home as a teenager pursuing music as a career. Aside from having one of the most heart-rendering voices in music, she plays nearly a dozen instruments including piano and guitar and is also an engineer and producer. Currently, Grey is the only artist signed to a production deal with Alex da Kid and is in the studio with the super producer writing and recording her debut album for Wonderland Music/Interscope Records, for which she intends to release the lead-off single this spring. Until the release, Grey remains mum about what fans can anticipate: “You’ll have to wait and see,” is all she has for those seeking insight. “I write songs purely based on my emotions. Whether its commercial or not has never mattered to me.”","<p>Skylar Grey is a singer/songwriter whose recent breakout performance on the <span class=""caps"">GRAMMY</span> Awards alongside Dr. Dre and Eminem for their newest single, “I Need A Doctor,” has elevated her into the spotlight, beyond her writing credits, as a phenomenal, critically-acclaimed singer.

The youngest of four, he was highly influenced by his sibling’s choices in music which ranged from early Electronic artists such as Bjork and Aphex Twin, to hip hop artists and groups such as Wu Tang Clan and the Fugees. it was these early influences that had shaped his understanding of both rhythm and melody at an early age. As a teenager, he attended a private school in Denver where he spent most of his time in the art and music departments. At this time, he began learning how to compose and produce digital music with early programs and developed skills in electronic and hip hop production. In 2007, he was accepted to The School of The Art Institute of Chicago for his paintings and drawings, but soon after studying painting, he was exposed to different forms and medias of art such as Performance Art and Fashion Design. After Spending time in each media he decided to focus primarily in Sound Art and Music Production and graduated with a BFA in Sound. He primarily began producing electronica, hip hop and crunk music, but then became highly influenced by EDM, IDM and Dubstep. He has produced and remixed tracks for Blu Mar Ten, Full Blush, Kid Sid, Zefora and various artists in both Chicago and Denver; and has produced music for fashion shows such as The Walk and Fashioning the Mind scape.

A magical synergy, boosted by Janmaats penchant for writing well-crafted, off the wall pop melodies and Van Leeuwens whimsical energy behind the drums .

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-black-atlantic","The Black Atlantic","Utrecht, NETH","indie, singer-songwriter, acoustic, dutch","The Black Atlantic is the Groningen (The Netherlands) based acoustic pop band formed around singer and songwriter Geert van der Velde, former frontman for American metalcore group Shai Hulud. The Black Atlantic released their debut album “Reverence for Fallen Trees” digitally for free (worldwide) as part of the In A Cabin With international recording series on August 21st, 2009. It has already been downloaded over 50.000 times since then… About “Reverence for Fallen Trees” In February, 2008, The Black Atlantic contacted the international recording project “In a Cabin With” (IACW) about a possible recording session. IACW were immediately enthusiastic and plans for a late 2008 recording, to take place in a log cabin, were made. The cabin, owned by van der Velde’s in-laws is located in the small town of Saranac Lake, in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York. For this recording, drummer Marcel Wolthof was re-enlisted alongside singer-songwriter Kim Janssen on various instruments. Janssen co-wrote some of the songs for the recording and has permanently settled in and joined the band. The title of the album “Reverence for Fallen Trees” is a metaphor for “honour the dead”, referring to van der Velde’s grandparents, 3 of whom passed away recently in the past year. The album deals with such topics as ‘remembrance’ , ‘grief’, ‘family’, ‘love’, ‘disenchantment’ and ‘overcoming’, eloquently worded and brought to life in natural methaphors and direct references to this period in his family history. Musically the new songs showcase a much wider variety of instrumentation and willingness to experiment with sounds and soundscapes, and the use of multi-layered vocal harmonies; inspired by such acts as Bon Iver, Fleet Foxes and the Beach Boys. Rhytmically the group has chosen for a much more minimal, percussive approach touring with only a snare drum, floor tom and cymbal. History & Touring: The Black Atlantic started as a project of van der Velde in his off time from his philosophy studies. Gradually the project turned more serious after van der Velde recorded his first song – a Valentine’s gift to his then girlfriend, now wife (and bandmember) – in February of 2006. After posting the song online (Myspace) and getting 2 immediate indie label deal offers, van der Velde wrote and recorded ‘Send This Home’ in the early Fall of 2006 with the help of various contributing friends and eventually abandoned his studies to focus full-time on the band. The EP documents van der Velde’s very first attempts at writing pop music, and showcases his penchant for melancholy and introspection, as well as his then obsession with Elbow. The EP was released on July 10th in the US by Five Point Records from New York (one of the two indie labels who had initially offered a deal). And, in January 2008, ‘Send This Home’ EP was re-released in Europe through Midsummer Records (DE). Live The Black Atlantic made it’s first live appearance, in one of many incarnations, at Eurosonic 2007. Since then the band has maintained a steady diet of touring, playing shows ,in a revolving line-up up, until April 2009, opening for Nada Surf (usa), Patrick Watson (ca) and touring the US East Coast and Midwest multiple times, once with Tim Williams (usa) and later with friends The Antlers (usa). In Europe the band has toured with Saturday Looks Good to Me (usa) and most recently with Windmill (uk).

After relocating to Cincinnati, OH at the age of 10, DJ Funeral Fresh became consumed by late 90’s era rap. Inspired by East Coast veterans and Southern rap legends, Fresh’s love of hip-hop culture inspired him to spend his adolescents writing rhymes in an attempt to become a MC, but as fate would have it, he found his niche behind a pair of turntables and a mixer. After years of practicing in the privacy of his bedroom DJ Funeral Fresh made his debut as DJ Skinny Fresh and quickly became one of southern Ohio’s most sought after DJs. The time he spent mastering the art of spinning proved valuable, allowing him to rock shows alongside artists across the Hip-Hop spectrum – from Rick Ross, DJ Drama, Young Jeezy and Gucci Mane, to Nicki Minaj, Method Man and Redman, Jadakiss, Bow Wow, and Soulja Boy. Over the last 6 years, DJ Funeral Fresh has made an indelible mark in his pursuit of DJ greatness by being an Atlantic Records College DJ, Ohio Hip Hop Awards “Best Club DJ” nominee for four years consecutively and working with premium brands like Nike, Ciroc Vodka and McDonald’s. DJ Funeral Fresh’s strong fan base and connection to street culture represent his eclectic music taste and have generated local and national press, most-notably Ozone Magazine, MTV and Complex. DJ Funeral Fresh has traveled nationally for an array of club appearances and industry events. He has been the choice for various celebrity engagements and he has performed in Cincinnati, OH, Columbus, OH, Atlanta, and New York City, just to name a few spots.

The band’s latest offering of bleeding heart defiance and optimism, The Better Angels of Our Nature, represents those attributes in both exhibition and execution. Rather than suffer the trappings of the record industry’s broken business model, the latest chapter in Glossary’s long legacy is available directly from the band completely free of charge. No strings attached, no cut corners, no hassle – just a band enthusiastic about what they’re doing. From the opening lilt of “Only Tell Will Tell” to the matter-of-fact declaration of “I’m still holding on to rock ‘n roll” on album closer “Blood On the Knobs,” there’s plenty on Better Angels about which to be excited. Having crashed the Glossary website the day of release due to the sheer volume of downloads, the band’s fifth full-length finds the septet ascending even higher above their simple Southern roots — exploring the beauty, nuance, conflict and contradictions of life in Dixie. The vitality found in these songs transcends whatever medium through which they might be presented, putting Glossary in a position of utmost importance during a cross-section in music’s history. The Better Angels of Our Nature will also be made available on CD on Oct 23, pressed in a series of short runs featuring artwork courtesy of local Middle Tennessee artists and designers, with a vinyl release to follow in early 2008. http://www.glossary.us/ Listen at Last.fmSome local bands build a buzz and a following until they get a crack at going national. Other local bands, like Murfreesboro, TN's Glossary, keep at it year after year because something needs to be expressed, even if no more than a few thousand people ever hear it. Those bands are the rock equivalent of regional filmmakers, turning out low-budget, heartfelt stories that zero in on lifestyles and locations that the mainstream media overlooks. Three years after knocking out the restless Southern-rock epic How We Handle Our Midnights, Glossary has scraped together enough money to make For What I Don't Become, with the help of Centro-Matic studio whiz Matt Pence. Like the previous album, the new one is full of loud, anthemic songs sparked with plenty of twang and chug. It's also another album about people who work hard and don't seem to get anywhere. For What I Don't Become's centerpiece song is ""Days Go By,"" a sprawling, scorching twang-rocker that makes the title phrase more haunting by adding the words ""even when we don't want 'em to."" For What I Don't Become weighs its rootsy kick against a strong note of loneliness on songs like ""Headstones And Dead Leaves"" and the molten ballad ""The Reckless,"" but the dominant tone of the album is set by the opening song ""Shaking Like A Flame,"" which rumbles like a locomotive even as Kneiser sings about how it feels to rust.

The debut album will still be entitled “Phantom Limb.” WATER LIARS — “PHANTOM LIMB” — Misra Records Bio: Perhaps one of the greatest albums in Misra’s canon, Water Liars’ debut was entirely unplanned. Recorded on a whim, with one microphone, the then unnamed rock band – consisting of St. Louis, MO songwriter, vocalist, guitarist Justin Kinkel-Schuster and Oxford, MS drummer, producer, multi-instrumentalist Andrew Bryant – casually convened to play and record. Over the course of three days, in the small milltown of Pittsboro, MS, a series of ineffable and magical recordings came together. It was one of those seemingly providential experiences – far too remarkable to be denied. Water Liars was born. Paste, Pop Matters, Daytrotter, KEXP, and more have all hailed Justin Kinkel-Schuster during his tenure fronting independent rock act Theodore. Some time back, Misra planned to work with Theodore and, assuming the songs were mere outtakes under a different moniker, the Water Liars demos initially got pushed to the back burner. Kinkel-Schuster pleasantly persisted, however, insisting the project was vastly different and must be heard. Upon first listen, it was very clear that something truly remarkable really had occurred in the Phantom Limb sessions. Misra signed the band on the spot. Home to groundbreaking debuts by Shearwater, Great Lake Swimmers, and more, the label is excited to extend this tradition with Water Liars. After its sludgy intro, album opener “$100” blossoms into a weary, folk-pop gem. “Dog Eaten,” a gorgeous acoustic number highlighting Kinkel-Schuster’s inimitable voice – a trademark that earned him “Best Vocalist” via St. Louis main rag The Riverfront Times — immediately follows. Through its ten-song set, Phantom Limb continues on this unpredictable path – wavering from fast to slow, loud to quiet, but never once losing its magnetism. Songs like “Whoa Back,” “Rest,” and “Fresh Hell” captivate the listener until “On the Day” – a celestial, melancholic track about one’s deathday – closes the album and an inadvertent field recording is heard in the background. It’s a beautiful, fortuitous ending to Water Liars’ beautiful, fortuitous debut. Enjoy! Track list: 1. $100 2. Dog Eaten 3. Whoa Back 4. Rest 5. C.H.W 6. Short Hair 7. It Is Well With My Soul 8.

The song-writing is focused, their technical prowess is flawless, and the sound is timeless yet distinct.” - Ohmpark “The group, under the direction of mastermind Brock Scott, has become one of Atlanta’s favorite sons by creating pure, orchestral pop with sparkling string arrangements and artful sensibility.” - Creative Loafing Bio “Little Tybee is something of a mini orchestra with its ever-evolving five to ten members all engaged in intricate musicianship. Their name comes from a tiny island off the coast of their native Georgia, where legend has it, an undetonated atomic bomb from the 1950s lies missing. They jokingly attribute the quirkiness of their debut album Building a Bomb to the long-term effects of eating radiation-drenched seafood, but it’s more likely they were just born that way” -Lavinia Jones Wright, ASCAP One might think from their humble beginnings in the backwaters and basements of coastal Georgia to their headlining shows at some of Atlanta’s most well known independent venues that the members of Little Tybee were the harbingers of some secret formula for artistic success. In reality, they are simply a group of friends who couldn’t stop making music together if they tried. The core of each of their songs begins in the relentless and creative mind of vocalist/guitarist/pianist Brock Scott. The songs mature through the dedicated musicianship of 8-string guitarist Josh Martin, violinist Nirvana Kelly, bassist Ryan Donald, and percussionist Pat Brooks. Since the release of their first LP last year, they have discovered that change is not only inevitable, but indeed good. Though Little Tybee has had its fair share of challenges along the way, the group has discovered that the path to musical success lies in patience and perseverance. Little Tybee isn’t afraid to experiment freely, even dangerously at times, to follow a musical idea to its ultimate end. This mentality has led the group to explore music that transcends genre and packs a much bigger punch than their modest title implies. While DIY in nature, Little Tybee collaborated with over 14 Atlanta instrumentalists to produce their latest album, Humorous to Bees. With this release, Little Tybee has proven that they are just as adept at writing lilting pop ballads and sprawling orchestral melodies as they are with Motown and Tropicalia. At last, Little Tybee has found their unique voice, and they are blasting their sound with little care for the neighbors.","<h2>The Buzz</h2> <p><em>“Little Tybee is a group that is really hard to put your finger on stylistically, and that’s the way we like it.”</em> <strong>- <span class=""caps"">FILTER</span></strong></p> <p><strong><br /> </strong></p> <p><em>“I can already go ahead and tell you that it will be one of the best records to come out of Atlanta this year.

My passions in life are music, graphic design, laughing and making people laugh, having awesome conversations, the internet, the concept of love, and attempting to solve problems and/or win the hearts of boys through catchy songs of hope. I like thunderstorms. I like staying in the movie theater till the film runs off the roll. I like you. I like me. I like “us”. I’ve loved music for as long as I can remember, and I played piano off and on as a kid. In 9th grade I needed to impress a boy in my creative writing class, so I decided to become a punk rock star. I asked my dad to teach me the guitar, and a few power chords later, my plan worked! The boy asked me out. I had my first boyfriend! A month later our relationship ended, but my love for the guitar lived on. Throughout high school I played in multiple terrible metal and punk bands before being introduced to “emo” music and picking up the acoustic guitar. I formed a duo with a close friend and spent a summer honing my songwriting and performing skills. As soon as I got to college in 2005, I became a solo artist. I spent the first two years paying my dues in this beautiful town I now call my home, and I plan to keep on doing what it takes to play my music for anyone who wants to listen. Heavily influenced by artists like Rilo Kiley, Tegan & Sara, Kevin Devine, and countless others from various genres, I developed a unique style of indiepopfolkrock. Clever lyrics, catchy hooks, tons of self-deprecation. Last year I released my first record, got to open for The Early November, played in the 500 Songs For Kids benefit concert, and rocked the outdoor stage at AthFest. I was nominated Best Solo Performer in the Flagpole Athens Music Awards. I also traveled over 4,000 miles on self-booked tours through the midwest and the east coast. I played the coolest venues in the coolest cities. I made a ton of friends and earned a comfy spot in the DIY indie scene. Two Thousand Eight looks promising so far! I have the most awesome band in the world, made up of my brother AJ on backup guitar/keys, Alec Wooden on the bass, and Donovan Babb on drums. We’re recording an EP that’s going to get so stuck in your head you won’t even be able to handle it.","<p>My name is Allison Weiss. I play guitar and tell my secrets to audiences.

As the role model for television’s Partridge Family, and a fine act in their own right, they had three top-ten singles with “Hair,” “The Rain, the Park and Other Things (Flower Girl),” and “We Can Fly.” Soon after those successes, Susan went into her first retirement at the tender age of 12. The ‘80s found Susan working with cult figure Dwight Twilley, her harmonies adding sparkle to many of Twilley’s greatest tracks, including his hit single “Girls.” Pop lovers could also spot her guesting with Redd Kross and the Smithereens. In the early ’90sThe Cowsills launched a fullfledged reunion, with new songs in a solid powerpop vein, and released the Global album, becoming cult heroes all over again. More guest appearances by Susan during this time were on two Hootie and the Blowfish records, Jules Shear, Kate Jacobs, and Giant Sand. Susan’s life and music took a fateful turn when she joined the popular roots-pop combo, the Continental Drifters. Susan’s exuberant stage presence and beautiful vocals proved an asset to the band. The Drifters made three critically-acclaimed albums, all of which recorded Susan blossoming as a songwriter. The 1999 disc Vermilion led off with Susan’s country-pop gem, “The Rain Song.” One publication gloated, “…vocal on the chorus…is the most heartbreaking musical moment of 1999.” (Gambit Weekly, Dec. 28, 1999) The song has since been covered by both The Bangles and Hootie and the Blowfish. And 2001’s Better Day album found her contributing four songs (one co-written with drummer, Russ Broussard). No Depression magazine noted on these songs, “…are the stuff big-time solo careers are made of.” Susan’s Cowsill’s solo album Just Believe It is the next logical step after the Drifters. Susan continues to write beautifully melodic songs, taking sympathetic looks at the imperfictions of life and love. Susan Cowsill’s gumbo sound springs from ‘60s pop roots with seasonings of Louisiana groove, country, and rock. Whether she’s doing her own material or covering the likes of Sandy Denny or Lucinda Williams, she can always connect with a haunting tune and emotive lyrics. As Bilboard Magazine expresses,“Cowsill…mines a child-like vulnerability, as she employs her achingly tarnished voice to a simple and moving effect.” Susan’s songs and voice have all the ingredients and delivery for her to easily be a hugely successful ‘crossover’ artist.","<p><span style=""font-family: arial, arial, sans-serif, helvetica; font-size: 11px; color: #ddddff; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 3px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 3px;""><br /> <p style=""font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif, helvetica; font: normal normal normal 11px/normal arial; text-transform: none; padding-left: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 0px;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Not many people were singing on hit singles and touring the world when their friends were still in kindergarten, but </span><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-size: 11px;""><span style=""text-decoration: none;"">The Cowsills</span></span></span></span></span><span style=""color: #000000;""> became a cherished part of ‘60s pop culture.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/paula-held","Paula Held","Peace Dale, RI","","BIO: Paula started writing songs at age 15 when she learned to play the guitar. She remembers taking two or three lessons and learning the 21 major, minor and 7th chords. At an early age, Paula studied violin, piano and concert harp. Her father, Arthur Custer, a Nadia Boulanger-trained musician and composer, encouraged her classical training, but by the time she turned 15, Paula had discovered Folk Music and a passion for songwriting. Like most kids of the 60s, she emulated her musical heroes of the day: Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, the Beatles and James Taylor. She spent the next decade woodshedding and singing with various bands at coffeehouses in her adopted town of Tallahassee, Florida. At age 26, with the birth of her son John, she put away her guitar and turned her attention to motherhood. In the midst of that provocative life experience, Paula rediscovered the Swing Era and fell in love with Jazz. A defining moment occurred in early April, 1990, as she was listening to public radio and Ella Fitzgerald singing Cole Porters tune, Easy to Love. The music spoke to her so strongly that she organized a quartet of local jazz musicians from the university, and by the end of the summer was performing regularly a repertoire of songs that ran the gamut from Duke Ellington and Jimmy Van Heusen to Antonio Carlos Jobim. She took courses in theory and voice, embracing the music that once poured through her Rhode Island home as a girl. By the late 90s, with her son in college, Paula began writing again in earnest, intent on developing her own sound and voice. In 2002, she left her day job and moved to a remote river town in Floridas Panhandle to work on her music. She began gigging regularly to pay the bills, and landed a job as the house musician on Friday nights at the Gibson Inn in Apalachicola. There she developed a following around her eclectic cover and original material. Friends gathered together funds to help her record several of her songs, and she released her 5 Songs CD in the Spring of 2003. Paulas sound has been described as breathy and intimate, jazzy and folky, Judy Collins meets Nancy Wilson, meets Bucky Pizzarelli, referring to her original music from her CD. She's received regular air play from WVFS-FM in Tallahassee, FL, WUFT-FM in Gainesville, FL, and KEOS-FM in College Station, TX. She's performed in concert at the Theatre of Memory in High Springs, Florida and various venues in Tallahassee, Florida. She was runner up at Eddie's Attic's famed Songwriter's Shootout in Atlanta, Georgia. In the Fall of 2003 and 2004, she appeared as a guest artist at the Annual Apalachicola Jazz, Blues and Folk Festival, head-lined by Miami Jazzman Joe Donato. In 2005 she performed at the Frank Brown International Songwriter's Festival in Florabama. Paula now lives and performs in Austin, TX.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/eric-hisaw","Eric Hisaw","Las Cruces New Mexico/ Austin Texas","","This August roots rocking Americana songwriter Eric Hisaw releases his fifth full length album Ghost Stories. A mix of Rolling Stones inspired rock’n’roll and the storytelling lyricism of Texas outlaw country, Lonestar Music’s Richard Skanse says “with the 10 just-about-perfect tales of hard-traveled and weary-hearted workingman blues… the journeyman songwriter, guitarist and singer delivers his first stone-cold masterpiece”. While Ghost Stories contains many of the same themes Hisaw’s previous work has covered, family, small town adolescence, wanderlust and dysfunction, this time out the songs are more personal. “Most every song is based on something that actually happened to me, even when I changed names and places, I still left a big piece of myself in there.” Adding to the lyrical grittiness is a tougher rocking sound. Longtime musical accoplices drummer Vicente Rodriguez and bassist/keyboardist Ron Flynt return. “We’ve played a lot of gigs and made several records together now and have developed a real natural way of playing off one another. The record has a real ‘live in the studio’ feeling. I mean there’s a ton of overdubs on there, I play three guitars on almost every song, but most of the hooks and the real essence of the songs were caught in the basic tracks on day one.” The addition of legendary steel guitar master Lloyd Maines on four tracks is an added bonus. Maines blends tasteful pedal steel with Hisaw’s telecaster fills on a pair of tunes and contributes dobro and lapsteel on two others. Two artists with albums recently produced by Hisaw add background vocals. Chrissy Flatt ( New Mystery Girl) handles the lion’s share of the harmonies, while country singer-songwriter Bracken Hale chips in on one cut. The opening track sets the tone, tracing the adolescent memories of friends and relatives gone missing over stinging guitar lines and driving drums. “Johnston County” is a Chuck Berry styled rocker about an eye opening road trip with an elder. “Payphone” captures a moment in time with a Johnny Cash meets JJ Cale train beat and atmospheric pedal steel guitar. “California”, “Lonely Road” and “Don’t Live Here” are rocking takes on friends and lovers from the past, while “The Love She Wants” is a shuffling country weeper. “Talk To Me” is roots-rock meets 70’s glam. The album finishes up with “Albuquerque” an uptempo Bakersfield influenced tale about a lost hitchiker at a New Mexico truckstop, and “Sleep” a waltz time lullaby to the child of hard partying parents. Born and raised in Las Cruces, NM and based in Austin, Tx for the better part of the last two decades, Hisaw has released five albums of original hard driving country rock. His previous two efforts 2006’s The Crosses and 2008’s Nature of the Blues made positive headway in the grassroots press and radio, reaching #2 and #3 respectively on the Freeform American Roots chart, living up to the promise made by his youthful 2000 debut Thing About Trains. Now in 2011 Ghost Stories finds the artist hitting his stride, the evocative imagery and lyrical density countered by the spririt in the grooves and bound together by the dedication and experience of a hard traveled seeker committed to reporting his findings from the lost highway. A great listen for fans of Joe Ely, Dave Alvin, Steve Earle and Alejandro Escovedo. “Eric Hisaw’s songwriting is uncorrupted and bulletproof. He’s a check you can cash at the bank of cool.” – Ray Wylie Hubbard “Many people including millionaire rockstars, write and sing about working class life, but Hisaw has and edge on all of them, authenticity…this is powerful stuff.” – John Conquest, 3rd Coast Music","<p>This August roots rocking Americana songwriter Eric Hisaw releases his fifth full length album Ghost Stories.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/pete-tong","Pete Tong","London,","dj, electronica, electronic, house, progressive house","PETE TONG is Britain’s best-loved dance DJ. He doesn’t need an award to prove his popularity and he won’t act cool to keep his credibility. The host of Radio 1’s ground-breaking Essential Selection show for a staggering eight years, he works within the mainstream, but is respected by the underground. Born in Dartford, educated in Rochester and inspired in his teens by the underground soul scene of the late seventies (and the music of the time…by the likes of Funkadelic, James Brown & Evelyn ""Champagne"" King) Pete’s first DJ job was at a wedding. He was 15 years old. A natural born entrepreneur, he began promoting local bands, booking gigs in a nearby town hall and – as part of the Kent ‘Soul Mafia’ – playing black soul & dance music in every club that would give him a gig. After leaving school, he bought a Transit van and set up his own sound system. In 1979, Pete became a journalist for monthly magazine Blues & Soul. By the following year, he was features editor, a position he would hold until ‘83. At the same time, he was appearing on local radio stations such as BBC Radio Medway and London. Then he got his first break with Radio 1, presenting a regular 15 minute ’magazine’ feature on dance music on Peter Powell’s show. ""That was a strange experience, but also very exciting,"" says Pete. ""Radio 1 was at the peak of its popularity. I had to say what was happening on the streets. I was the first person to play Malcolm McLaren’s Buffalo Gals on the radio."" Pete’s knowledge of the dance underground, coupled with his ear for a crossover hit, saw him appointed A&R manager at newly-founded independent label London Records in ‘83. While looking after the careers of pop acts like ’80s girl group Bananarama, he continued to pursue his budding radio career. Put off daytime shows by the discovery that the DJs didn’t pick their own playlists, Pete accepted his own programme on Kent’s newly-launched Invicta station in ‘84. Influenced by radio DJ heroes such as Robbie Vincent, Greg Edwards and Emperor Rosko, he hosted a soul show there for three years, before briefly returning to Radio London. Almost immediately, however, he was poached by Capital Radio, where his weekly dance programme became cult listening with London clubbers. In ’88, in the wake of Acid House, Pete launched his own record label, FFRR, through London Records. His aim was to both embrace the new wave of electronic music flooding into the country from cities such as Detroit and Chicago, and continue to promote his first love, black dance artists. ""The first record I put out was a very cool, quite sexually-explicit single from Chicago called Baby Wants To Ride,"" he recalls. ""I had a rule which was to sign one relatively-indulgent record to every potential big hit. I was aware from the start that you can be hip, but you also have to balance the books."" Inevitably, Pete managed to do both, simultaneously. FFRR’s next releases were cut’n’paste production ‘Bass (How Low Can You Go?)’ by Simon Harris and Salt’n’Pepa’s ‘Push It’, both cool club tracks which went on to storm the charts. They were followed by a stream of influential hits from signings such as Steve ‘Silk’ Hurley, D Mob, Smith & Mighty, Cookie Crew, L’il Louis The Brand New Heavies, Orbital and, of course, Goldie. In ‘91, with an indigenous club culture now thriving in cities across the UK, Pete quit Capital Radio to go national. His Essential Selection show every Friday evening instantly established itself as a welcome to the weekend for a new generation of young clubbers. Heavy on house, but with room for the best breaking techno, jungle, hip hop, funk and soul sounds from both Britain and around the world, it appealed to all tastes in contemporary dance music. Moreover, it merged the cutting-edge with the mainstream. Pete became the country’s best-known dance DJ, while keeping his credibility intact. ""I’m not too concerned with credibility,"" he claims. ""When I started out, I was obsessed by jazz-funk and soul. I couldn’t see life beyond the end of a Donald Byrd album. I was prepared to punch anyone who tried to talk to me about other types of music. But I grew up and discovered that I love hearing new sounds and having my perceptions changed. I didn’t want to be pigeon-holed. I also realised that I could achieve much more by staying on the edge of several scenes, rather than being immersed in just the one."" Perhaps Pete’s biggest contribution to British pop to date was his involvement in the reshaping of BBC Radio 1. When the nation’s biggest radio station decided to re-invent itself in the mid-‘90s, controller Matthew Bannister knew precisely who to ask for help. After Pete’s ideas were taken on board, the likes of Tim Westwood, Danny Rampling, Judge Jules, Carl Cox and, more recently, Fabio and Grooverider, started to appear on Radio 1’s DJ roster. In addition, the station’s daytime playlist began to reflect the extent of the impact of modern electronic music on British kids. In January ‘99, Pete enters his eighth year as the presenter of Essential Selection. With over a million and a half listeners each week, it remains the UK’s most popular dance music radio show, thanks to its host’s consistent ability to change with the times. Its success has also spawned a series of compilation albums, released by FFRR, which to date have sold over 750,000 copies. The latest – which boasts a tangerine-themed cover and the mixing talents of Tong, Paul Oakenfold and, if you’re lucky enough to bag a limited edition copy with a bonus CD, Carl Cox – comes complete with Madonna’s seal of approval. It is the first time ever that the singer has sanctioned the appearance of one of her songs (Drowned World) on a dance mix compilation. During ‘98, Pete made his first forays into television, an area he is keen to explore. In November, he donned different guises to present Clublife, a 90-minute, BBC-broadcast documentary based on Mixmag magazine’s annual dance awards. However, when he does appear with his own TV programme, it won’t be for want of publicity. In the past, he has turned down offers to present Radio 1’s high-profile breakfast and Top 40 shows, not to mention Top Of The Pops. In the meantime, Pete has plenty on his plate. He is a director of Wise Buddah, the production company which makes radio programmes presented by Danny Rampling, Seb Fontiane and Judge Jules and continues to work in A&R for London Records. His pop star credentials include A&R-ing Shakespeare Sister’s hit Stay, which topped the charts for six weeks in ‘92, and played a big role in signing All Saints, whose career he continues to oversee. He was recently musical director on films, Human Traffic and The Beach. The year 2000 proved to be a milestone for Pete – he toured the US for the first time which saw queues around the block, he played on the terrace at Space in Ibiza for the first time, he played in Cape Town and Johannesburg and hosted his own float at Radio 1’s ‘Love Parade’ – ""standing on my float with Jon Carter and Darren Emerson in front of 250,000 Radio 1 listeners was just the best feeling ever – a real moment in history"". 2001 is proving to be an equally exciting year for Pete with another tour of the States starting in March and his first tour of South America scheduled for later in the year. Keeping his feet on the ground in the UK, Pete continues to be a valuable part of the British club scene with regular gigs scheduled at Tribal Sessions at Sankey Soap in Manchester, Code in Birmingham and many other credible commitments. He still remains a key figure at the UK summer festivals including for the first time a performance at T-In The Park as well as his yearly appointment at Creamfields and Homelands (Foot and mouth permitting). Pete’s Radio 1 show ""The Essential Selection"" is now the most listened to radio show on the internet attracting a global audience of over 12 million.

They may love the Beatles and Cheap Trick as much as T-Rex and the Rolling Stones, but TAB the Band aren’t classic rockers; they’re a vibrant, contemporary band that blends the vigor of punk, the might of arena rock and the melodicism of power-pop. TAB the Band heads to Lollapalooza after spending 2010 on tour in the US and UK with Stone Temple Pilots, Cage the Elephant, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, and Slash. TAB the Band has also opened for the likes of Modest Mouse and Dinosaur Jr. The band has been featured by Little Steven’s Underground Garage, The Howard Stern Show, MTV’s Jersey Shore, HBO’s Entourage, the MLB2K11 video game, and at major festivals such as the Hyde Park Calling Festival, Download Festival, and SXSW. TAB the Band’s full range can be heard on 2010’s ‘Zoo Noises,’ a free-wheeling, all-encompassing carnival ride, fueled by such intoxicating singles as the percussive “She Said No (I Love You)” and the breakneck hooks of “Bought and Sold.” “[Zoo Noises is]…brilliantly eclectic: a Stones drawl here, a Beatles harmony there, pop, rock, funk, punk.” – Classic Rock Magazine (UK) TAB the Band is currently working on its newest album with producer Mark Neill (The Black Keys, Dan Auerbach, Old 97s).","<p>A rock & roll band with an enduring fondness for pure pop and a wicked, sly sense of humor, <span class=""caps"">TAB</span> the Band defy easy categorization.

It’s a pretty standard, unremarkable story — except it took place in Iran, where, as Koory puts it, “you can find instruments, but the problem is that you’re probably going to get the shittiest ones, at triple the price,” and where the legality of pop music is, he says, similar to that of marijuana: You can buy the supplies, but don’t get caught fooling with the substance. In Brooklyn, where Yellow Dogs currently reside, forming a post-punk band with your friends is about as remarkable an activity as ordering Thai food. In Tehran, it was like more like a covert operation. And, lo and behold, the music they produced, the four-song EP Upper Class Complexity, crackles with more life, wit, tension and imagination than most of their peers. Maybe there’s something to be said for having to work for it.The sound of Upper Class Complexityfeels a little out-of-step with the current Brooklyn-scene moment, but in the best possible way: While more bands are chasing hazy good vibes and New Zealand-inspired indie jangle (Real Estate‘s self-titled appears to be slowly morphing into some kids’ Is This It?), Yellow Dogs’ music harks back to a moment when every band had a busily riding hi-hat, rhythmic stabs of guitar, and a head full of frayed nerves: the brittle post-punk moment of circa-2003. Yellow Dogs songs are fiendish, caffeinated little puzzles of warily circling guitar and keyboards, each element feeling close and cramped, like riders stuck in a stalled elevator.With their just-so vintage keyboard sounds, the echo-laden recording atmosphere, and the herky-jerk mid-song breakdowns, these songs seem to spring from years’ worth of close study of post-punk deep catalog. Imagine our surprise, then, when the members confessed to not hearing most of these touchstones until after they had found their sound: apart from Joy Division and the Clash, they learned at the feet of those who worshiped the sound with the same reverence they did: Rancid, in other words, was a big influence. But we can’t detect a single hint of attenuation in the resulting music. “The City,” which closes the EP, is a sneering, evil two-chord vamp that just keeps breaking down into smaller and smaller parts, until finally it’s nothing more than a spidery guitar line crawling up your backbone. The song could easily go on for nine minutes and never peter out — live, we hear, it sometimes does — but they cut it off, sharp and still sparking, before it hits five minutes: one last expertly deployed cold-water bucket to the face. It only proves that you don’t always need first-hand experience with the source to catch the spirit.","<p>Koory, Looloosh and Obaash met and formed the way of young rock bands since time immemorial: Hanging out at a local park as teenagers, among skaters and punk rockers, they bonded over their mutual tastes and began playing together.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/john-digweed","John Digweed","","","If you’re not an avid follower of dance music but are tuned into popular culture at all you’ve likely experienced music touched by the hands of John Digweed. Originally hailing from England but having clearly arrived on the global scene well over a decade ago John has long since cemented his name in the pages of dance music history. His list of achievements is groundbreaking to say the least. Highlights of which would be the first proper dj mix compilation (“The Mix Collection”, done with Sasha), being the first British dj to hold a residency at what was then the world’s most well known club in NYC (Twilo, also with Sasha) as well as having remixed music by William Orbit, Underworld, Quincy Jones, Mr Fogg and New Order. John Digweed is a DJ’s DJ. The beauty of what he does lies in just how different he really is from his contemporaries. From his early beginnings in Hastings, England at the age of 15 in the blossoming scene of acid house to the apex of the international dj’ing world he has created and maintained a level of integrity that is the benchmark for both dj’s and producers globally. In fact, he has reached the very top of his profession, being voted #1 in a voter’s poll. John Digweed has become the people’s choice while maintaining his longstanding presence in underground dance culture. His popularity as both a dj and a person seems to have no limits, but his efforts transcend dj’ing alone, he is as much a producer and promoter. His moniker “Bedrock” is actually three things: a record label, a promotions company and a studio production partnership with Nick Muir. His management and creative direction for the Bedrock record label spans over 12 years with the vision and creative insight to seek out mixes and remixes from the worlds best producers . To have a record released on Bedrock serves as the global stamp of production quality, ingenuity and integrity for underground producers worldwide. In fact, the name John Digweed is synonymous with those very qualities. From the nights he has either created or been a part of (Bedrock, Northern Exposure) to his world renowned mix cd’s (Renaissance, GU, Northern Exposure, Transitions and Bedrock compilation album`s 10 ,11 12 and Structures) he has consistently produced characteristic products that stay in demand, himself included. As one half of Bedrock the production duo he has landed two tracks in the top 40 (“Heaven Scent” and “For What You Dream Of”) the latter of which made it into the hit movie “Trainspotting”. He has even tried a bit of acting himself (“Groove”). He and Nick Muir as Bedrock the production team also scored a Hollywood film (“Stark Raving Mad”) as well as the animated release of “Spider-Man” for Sony / MTV. He’s toured every corner of the planet including bus tours in the USA (Delta Heavy and Area 2 (with David Bowie and Moby) , The legendary Big Beach Boutique in Brighton with Fatboy slim had him gladly performing to 250,000 and most recently selling out the O2 Brixton Academy for Bedrock`s 12th Anniversary. His Transitions Radio show is now it`s 10th year and is still one of the most successful dance music shows, being broadcast to over 30 countries across the world to a weekly audience of over 12 million. As a person John’s lack of pretense is enveloped in imagination and invention. Good reason for John being one of the most respected, analyzed and imitated dj’s in the world. Digweed is both solid and durable with unyielding precision. His sinuous dj’ing and production sound has become its own convincing dance ethic. He is centered to the principles of life, living and friends in such a way that he generates an aura of self-explanatory excitement and enthusiasm. Without heroic pretensions his sets are filled with moodiness and musical mystery but held down with a punchy distinctiveness and earthly rhythm. Always emanating a sense of boundlessness he overlaps dream events that spill into reality with an enormous certainty.","<p>If you’re not an avid follower of dance music but are tuned into popular culture at all you’ve likely experienced music touched by the hands of John Digweed.

Since the release of her 2007 debut album, Hanging Spoons, Gina has toured with The Kills and Grace Potter & the Nocturnals, shared the stage with Ozomatli, Grupo Fantasma, and Del Castillo, and represented the City of Austin on tour in Japan and on the 2011 Austin Music Vol. 10 compilation. National Public Radio touted her one of eight “New Latin Artists at SXSW” and her music as a “perfect mix of Latin, folk and bluegrass.” The Austin Chronicle claimed her “the breakout artist” of the 2011 Pachanga Music Festival.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/ane-trolle","Ane Trolle","Copenhagen","trip-hop, danish, aurgasm","The Past Gifted with a natural musical talent, her rough and vivid voice has taken Ane Trolle far within the Danish music scene, and with a rare ability to engage in an array of creative ventures, Trolle has managed to become one the most recognized female artists in Denmark. 2006 found her bursting out of our radios with sweet treats of honey-drippin’ reggae-pop in the company of Danish rapper/producer, Pato, as the duo Trolle // Siebenhaar. The same year she could be heard putting down the melancholic and yearning vocals for the highly acclaimed producer and DJ Trentemøller. Together with her good friend and colleague, Josephine Philip, Trolle created a unique and playful universe under the name of JaConfetti. Her latest musical output includes her role in the trio, Balstyrko, alongside Blæs Bukki, and Ormen, creating some of the most interesting Danish music to hit the national charts. Not only has Ane been able to cross over to a larger and more mainstream Danish audience – despite her often quite uncompromising take on musical subgenres – she’s also experienced some significant success abroad. In particular, collaborations with both Siebenhaar and Trentemøller have generated international recognition – notably hitting the charts in Germany and France with the Trolle//Siebenhaar-single Sweet Dogs. Not to forget her crucial vocal feature on Trentemøller’s massive electronica hit, Moan. Prior to her involvement in the these collaborations, Ane Trolle was a frequent act in the Danish underground, best known for her ability to jump onstage at any request and blow the audience away with an immediate outburst of improvised lyricism and melody. Present Working closely with producer and musician, Peter Leth (The Crooked Spoke, Junior Senior (live)), Trolle has gathered all her experiences from previous collaborations under one roof. Now we find her ready to release her debut album as a solo artist. The material for the album, Honest Wall, has come about after several years of travelling to remote and exotic destinations, such as Rwanda, USA and Haiti, hooking up with a vast variety of authentic and enthusiastic people, all sharing their own inspiring stories. Subsequently, she would spend endless nights in the studio and in her home – a cosy wooden cottage not far from the centre of Copenhagen – processing the ideas and impressions from these adventures. Honest Wall is a compressed distillate of Trolle’s eclectic experiences and wide-ranging universe, personally as well as musically. It bears witness to her constant curiosity and reluctance towards monotony. In Ane’s own words “it would feel wrong to make a streamlined album. It has to be a wide variety of moods, colours and sounds to righteously portray my inner self.” The lyrical spectrum found on Honest Wall reflects the diverse nature of the music. The songs are rooted in Ane’s desire to portray close relationships, and the feelings that accompany them. The song Remedy deals with ambivalence; the often difficult and yet warm family relations. Lost and unresolved love is a central theme in both Ribbon Arms and Algae & Bottles, whereas the title track is a sincere celebration of art, creativity and playfulness. According to Ane Trolle Honest Wall is about “Passion, curiosity and the importance of letting this passion be the key factor in life”.","<p>The Past<br /> Gifted with a natural musical talent, her rough and vivid voice has taken Ane Trolle far within the Danish music scene, and with a rare ability to engage in an array of creative ventures, Trolle has managed to become one the most recognized female artists in Denmark.</p> <p>2006 found her bursting out of our radios with sweet treats of honey-drippin’ reggae-pop in the company of Danish rapper/producer, Pato, as the duo Trolle // Siebenhaar.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/rod-melancon","Rod Melancon","Louisiana","","Roots country singer/songwriter Rod Melancon was born August 16, 1988 in South Louisiana. At the age of 18 he packed and headed out west to California. In December 2007, he received his first guitar as a Christmas Present. That same year he bought his grandfather a cd with a collection of Hank Williams Sr. songs. His grandfather went into a corner of the house, put on the album, and listened for what seemed to be hours. Amazed at the impact the collection of songs had on his grandfather, Rod soon started teaching himself to play by listening to that same collection of songs. Before too long, he started writing his own songs. His first song, “My Brother” which he wrote in late 2008 received a lot of great feedback which motivated him to put more and more effort into it. Around the same time he met Brad Nickel, a fellow musician and kindred spirit from New York who supported and encouraged Rod’s musical explorations. After a series of late night jam sessions, Brad offered to produce Rod’s first album gratis. In early, 2009 over two whirlwind weeks, Rod recorded what would become his self titled debut album of 11 songs at Brad’s parents home in Idaho. Nine of the songs were written by Rod, while “On The Road” and “Sweet Simplicity” were written in collaboration with Brad. Rod’s debut album was released on CD Baby, www.cdbaby.com, in July 2009 and soon after was picked up by iTunes, Rhapsody, and Amazon. He charted almost immediately on the alternative country charts and has been reviewed positively in a number of international markets, Belgium, UK, and the Netherlands just to name few. He’s been likened to a young Johnny Cash and Steve Earle.","<p>Roots country singer/songwriter Rod Melancon was born August 16, 1988 in South Louisiana.

It all began when Puff was young dude raised by his mother, a college graduate, and his father, a part time super dad and street hustler. Puff has seen everything growing up, but at this part of Puff’s life the only things that were important were video games, football and rap. One day Puff’s house was kicked in by the ATF. Everything in Puff’s life changed for the worst after that. His family was homeless and had to stay with grandparents. Puff had to take care of his family. Puff took up the family trade and started hustling. A year later Puff’s best friend was killed. That woke Puff up to put more energy into something positive. In 2006 West Coast legend, Mack 10, signed Ruka to his label, Hoo- Bangin, after seeing him perform at a club in St. Louis. The rapper bought two of Ruka’s songs even one for using for his first single, “Like This” with Nate Dogg. The song was a product placement phenomenon! It was used for NFL games, movies ( Waist Deep starring Tyrese), The Soprano’s, and tons of other TV and radio commercials. Rukapuff’s music has also been featured in other areas of the entertainment field as well. Puff had the official World Series championship song and video for the St. Louis Cardinals. “Brimmy” debuted on Fox Sports Midwest during the Cardinals pennant run. The staff at Fox were so pleased with the first project they asked Ruka to do another song and video for the Indiana Pacers home games. Currently Rukapuff is a household name in the Midwest just awaiting his turn to breakthrough worldwide. Ruka is definitely one of the most diverse and complete artist in the game today. This promoter, entertainer, songwriter, humanitarian, and parent is a mogul in the making and is the definition of grind. Some critics say he has one the best stage shows ever seen… you be the judge!","<p>The 27 year old MC from Saint Louis, Missouri understands the <br /> definition of Grind, and emotional roller coaster performances to bring <br /> to the world Bi-polar swing!</p> <p>It all began when Puff was young dude raised by his mother, a college<br /> graduate, and his father, a part time super dad and street hustler. <br /> Puff has seen everything growing up, but at this part of Puff’s life the<br /> only things that were important were video games, football and rap.

She recently released her first EP called Rocketship Girl (http://gracelondon.bandcamp.com/). Grace started loving music when she was about one and a half after watching the Wizard of Oz for the first time. She fell in love with it and watched it obsessively until she had memorized all of the songs.When Grace was seven, she started taking classical guitar lessons, but she really started having fun when she would sing and play songs she liked listening to at the time. Grace started playing shows around Austin at coffee shops and fundraisers and parties at nine, and hasn’t stopped since! Behind all this passion for music, Grace is also driven to use her music to do good! Already throughout her young career, Grace’s performances have been dominated by the theme of using her music to help others, support numerous charities, and raised over $35,000 to help fight extreme poverty in Africa. Last year, Grace supported the GLSEN – National Safe Schools Program with her former band Residual Kid when they chose to donate all proceeds of the song “Can’t Take Me Away” to the organization. The song, which Grace penned, was featured on the ABC show “20/20” in October of 2011. In 2010, she used her music to help others when she “donated” her birthday as a chance to hold a charity concert to raise money for a water well in Ethiopia. In 2011, she again took the stage to help those in Ethiopia. This time she was lending her support to A Glimmer of Hope as they raised money for famine relief efforts and to build a new health clinic. Grace’s musical campaigns for Glimmer raised more than $25,000. When I write songs, words spill out that really don’t make sense at all,"" she says, “but when I look at it afterwards, it means something to me and I understand what I was saying when I wrote it!” Grace knows exactly who she is and her music and the way she uses it to help others is a strong reflection of what she values. Now, with her first EP release under her belt, she continues to write more songs and to grow as an artist while making sure that she helps make the world a better place for others in need.","<p><span><span class=""wysiwyg-color-red""><b><span class=""caps"">SXSW</span> 2013 <span class=""caps"">OFFICIAL</span> <span class=""caps"">SHOWCASE</span> <span class=""caps"">SELECTION</span></b></span><br><br>Grace London is a 13-year-old singer/songwriter, currently living in Los Angeles, CA.

"http://do512.com/c/sx2013/bands/the-bare-feat","The Bare Feat","Austin,Tx","","Prepare yourself….. there’s a LOT of history in this thing… The Bare Feat has actually taken many years to develop into what it is today. The band’s founding members are Jacob Ruegg and Nick Hamner. They started playing music together in the seventh grade, although have known each other since the first grade. After a few months Lang Anderson (also a friend of both nick and Jacob since the first grade) began to play keys with them at that time in the band with Nick on drums, Jacob on guitar, and Lang on keys. They began their dream of making it big some day! The next year a friend that Nick met in orchestra by the name of Charlie Deschodt joined the band as the bass player. Getting started was hard because we never learned any covers due to the fact that we were determined to write original music. The summer before the guys would hit high school, Lang and Nick decided to attend the Natural Ear Music Camp and were put in a band with Mikah Pace, who after their session at the camp would become their back up guitarist. Nick and Jacob began to be unhappy with the band’s progress over the next two years so they began to have more practices a week. These practices would take place at Taylor Anderson’s house. The band had met Taylor in the eighth grade and he had become a good friend of all the members and soon joined them to play baritone. As the summer came too an end, High School began and the band didn’t meet very often if at all. Though Nick and Jacob still wrote music together, during that year Mikah quit the band because he just didn’t have enough time anymore. Though as Mikah left the band two new members were added: Ryder Turner and Mazen Khawaja. Ryder was added to the horn section to join Taylor and Mazen would replace Nick as the drummer and Nick moved to bass (which he had been learning on the side). Sadly at the end of the year Mazen moved, leaving the band without a drummer. It wasn’t until the band’s second year in High School that they began to pick up again. Though their good friend Taylor had to quit the band because of a lack of time to commit (Taylor still works with the band as a finance advisor), Myles Miller (Nick met him in orchestra) began to play with the band and moved Jacob to sax (which Jacob had played since the 5th grade and in the eighth grade got best solo in his jazz band). The same week that Myles joined the band, they recruited bass player Jacob Hope, moving Nick back to his original role as drummer. Things were going well once again. The band had practices as often as they could, though there still remained a problem. There was no vocalist. This is were Mason Ables came in. Mason was a good friend of Jacob Hope and shortly after Mason joined, another singer was added, Luz Zamora. Then we decided to beef up the horn section with Logan Bartlett on trumpet (whom nick and lang had played basketball with in earlier years) and baritone player Ore Afolayan…..add that all up and you’ll get the nine piece, funky rock band, The Bare Feat.","<p>Prepare yourself….. there’s a <span class=""caps"">LOT</span> of history in this thing…</p> <p>The Bare Feat has actually taken many years to develop into what it is today.

During the summer of 2011 the duo finally settled on what they wanted to present themselves as and what the soul purpose of the band was: “To create something new without any boundaries or limitations, and to do everything ourselves.”, states Matthew Breaux. They spent countless time slowly learning how to promote and spread their music.They decided they had enough material to skip over making an EP, and in August 2011, they began recording for their first album. In December 2011, Naybor’s Basement released their debut studio album entitled “FIrst Steps.” It has sold particularly well considering the short amount of time it has been out and for the size of their group. “People love hearing us live, but haven’t had the time to get to know the songs, so we didn’t want to put off recording this album. Now everyone can hear the music in good quality and know the music for the shows.”, said the band.
