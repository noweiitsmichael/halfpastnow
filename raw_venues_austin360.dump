A popular dish, the salt and pepper shrimp featured unpeeled shellfish that were coated with a salt-and-pepper batter and deep-fried. Even with the cartilage, they were delectable. The chicken with black mushrooms, a clay pot item, and the shrimp roll appetizer were tasty. Forks up. -- Dale Rice, AA-S

Try this one: Kayo and Také Asazu have two young children, they run a catering business called Deli Bento, he's a chef at Yu Sushi Izagaya downtown ... and they have this trailer on Manor Road called Sushi A-Go-Go where they sell sushi rolls six days a week. But the first question always seems to be, 'How good can sushi from a trailer be?' The answer is: just fine. When Kayo Asazu opens the service window, the frosty rush of the air conditioning flows out, and she keeps the fish and vegetables fresh in the commercial-grade refrigerator inside the new Magnum trailer.\\n \\n \\nJapanese natives who've been in Austin about eight years, the Asazus offer sushi rolls primarily in the $4 to $6 range, with familiar choices such as crab salad, spicy shrimp, barbecued eel, tempura and smoked salmon, plus a range of veggie rolls starting at $3.50. For $12, the Fat Samurai roll is packed with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, crab salad, shrimp and avocado. The Longhorn Roll ($5.50) has rib-eye steak, cream cheese and avocado.\\n \\n \\nKayo Asazu says she wants to help people experience sushi for the first time, but for the adventurous, there's a Swamp Roll with Tabasco, crawfish and okra that honors the couple's time in New Orleans. Another specialty is 'Box Sushi,' with the rice pressed in a wooden mold rather than rolled, filled with crab salad and a choice of fish, starting at $10.\\n \\n \\nCustomer Carmen Knight said, 'It's fun to get something fast that's not fast food.' And speaking of fast, you'd be advised to hit the Manor Road location soon. The couple plans to move the trailer north to 4001 Medical Parkway in the next month or so. The Asazus promise to keep customers up to date on Twitter (@sushi_a_go_go).\\n \\n \\n— Mike Sutter

We serve a full menu of dinner and drinks to your seat while you watch the movie. The theater is laid out like a traditional movie theater, except every other row of seats has been replaced with a long narrow table for your food and drinks. Those who have never been to the Alamo may worry about disruptions during the movie, but we have devised an ordering system that minimizes interaction during the film, allowing you to order, eat and enjoy the movie with minimal distraction. We recommend arriving early; seating begins 45 minutes before the show and there is always pre-movie entertainment on the screen while you wait for the movie. We have waiters that serve you at your seat; orders before the movie begins are taken in the traditional way. Once the movie starts if you need anything at all, there is paper and pencils at the table, write down what you need on the paper, stand the paper up on the card holder attached to the table. This acts as a flag, your waiter will only come by if he sees the card, otherwise he will stay out of your way so you can enjoy the film.

He managed Austin's premiere Starbucks shop at Sixth Street and Congress Avenue, managed the opening of Babbo's (later Teo) in the 26 Doors shopping center and whipped out the java drinks as a barrista at Jo's. But it's Black's Beverly Hills connection that led him to open the Second Street branch of Teuscher (TOY-sher) Chocolates of Switzerland & Coffee . Black recently managed the Beverly Hills location of the global chain before moving back to Austin, drawn by better air, a shorter commute and the chance to bring Oprah Winfrey's favorite champagne truffles to the city he missed. At Teuscher (409 W. Second St. 236-1657, www.teuscheraustin.com), Black carries an extensive line of chocolates, truffles and dipped delights from the Swiss company, sold by the pound ($75), in boxes plain and fancy and animal-shaped and by the piece ($1.50-$2.25). They're good, no doubt about it, but Austinites might be more intrigued by the $10,000 Clover brewing system that lets the barrista custom-grind beans from a menu of estate coffees — Brazilian Ipanema, Matalapa from El Salvador, Ethiopian Mora Mora — and brew them one cup at a time (starting at $3.25). The shop also pours a full line of coffee drinks, propelled by Black's penchant for the artistic latte, topped by lacy foamed leaves and available from a walk-up window or inside the store, where the chocolates call like sirens from a glass case.\\n-- Mike Sutter, AMERICAN-STATESMAN RESTAURANT CRITIC

Billboard magazine listed the Cactus as one of fifteen "solidly respected, savvy clubs" nationwide "from which careers can be cut, that work with proven names and new faces." Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen, Lucinda Williams, Shawn Colvin, Nanci Griffith and Ani DiFranco are among the singer-songwriters who frequently graced the Cactus stage early in their careers. Over the last twenty-five years many well-known artists performed at the Cactus Cafe, many to return time and time again. Cactus stage. Among them: Alison Krauss, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Butch Hancock, Townes Van Zandt, Loudon Wainwright III, Bill Monroe, Richard Thompson, Guy Clark, the Dixie Chicks, John Hiatt, Iris Dement, Ralph Stanley, Suzanne Vega, Gillian Welch, Patty Griffin and the list goes on... When artists outgrow the comfy confines of the Cactus, we'll often move these artists to larger venues in the building such as the Texas Union Theatre (375 seats) or the Texas Union Ballroom (1200 seats). So watch for those shows too! The Cactus is a non-smoking venue and has a full bar.

Many of these American artisans fled to Europe where their recipes would make places like London’s Savoy Hotel famous. For decades, Mixology was largely lost in the states. Bars served unimaginative mixtures to patrons who never knew the classic concoctions enjoyed only a generation before. To experience the real thing, I, like many others, traveled abroad. While in my travels a curious spirit caught my interest; long prohibited in the states, Absinthe had now become available, and Peche’ is Austin’s only place to experience it in its true form. Together, with the brilliant culinary mind of Chef Jason Dodge, I offer my friends the most unique cocktail experience in Austin, alongside a stunning menu of European comfort dishes. A revolution has begun in the Sprits community and Peche’ brings together both food and drink for a truly unique evening. Genuine appreciation for skillfully crafted libations and cuisine has been reborn in Austin. It is my sincere wish not only to provide our patrons with quality fare, but to educate them as well; to bring this knowledge to the people. My staff and I not only welcome questions, we encourage them. Quality is, after all, for everyone. Peche’ brings the enjoyment ethic of the old world back to life, right here today, in Austin’s historic Warehouse district.

The theater was built by Richard Garriot as a scaled replica of an Elizabethan outdoor theater. It was named The Curtain, after the original Curtain Theatre. The original Curtain Theatre was an Elizabethan playhouse located in Curtain Close, Shoreditch (part of the modern London Borough of Hackney), just outside the City of London. It opened in 1577, and continued staging plays until 1622. Capable of seating well over a hundred, Garriott's Curtain theater is modeled after the style that is also replicated in full-scale by Sam Wanamaker's Globe Theatre replica in Southwark, on the south bank of the Thames, in an area known as Bankside, a part of London. As in the original and reconstruction Globes, the Curtain theater has a thrust stage that projects into a large circular yard surrounded by tiers of steeply raked seating. The only covered parts of the amphitheater are the stage and the tiered seating areas. In The Curtain 'groundlings” are permitted to sit on the provided benches in the pit, where those in Shakespeare's time were only permitted standing room. The Curtain has modern amenities artfully hidden and disguised. The dressing rooms are fully modern with lighting, plumbing and air conditioned dressing rooms. The theater has stage lighting permitting plays to be performed year round and at anytime of the day rather only during daylight hours.

Our services may not be like any you have experienced before. Yet we probably share many of the same beliefs. At First UU, we are primarily concerned with how we should live, individually and collectively, so that we might become better people, partners, parents and citizens. Our services might present readings from theism, religious humanism or a variety of ancient or modern myths. At first, it may sound strange to hear language that expresses spirituality in such diverse ways. Beneath the different styles of expression, there is a much deeper and more relevant list of beliefs we all share. A Place to Explore Life’s Questions With historical roots in the Judeo-Christian tradition, our liberal religion keeps an open mind to the spiritual questions people have asked for centuries. We are a “non-creedal” congregation, which means that we seek religious truth through personal experience, conscience and reason- not from any book or religious authority. This doesn’t mean that whatever anyone believes is fine, since some beliefs are good for us and others are not as healthy. We regard the highest values to be integrity, caring, compassion, social justice, truth, personal peace and harmony. Advancing these values is a major purpose of our congregation. A Religion for Both Head and Heart Whether it’s an issue of vital community interest at our Sunday forums or a seminar that explores your particular spiritual quest, you can find your place here. While each member would probably express his or her beliefs a bit differently, the following are just some of the things many of our members believe: # We believe that we’re a part of Life, and owe something back to the world for the gift of life. # We believe that almost all religions are saying that we are precious people who need to treat everybody else as though they are precious, too. # We believe that we are supposed to live in such a way that, when we look back on our lives, we can be proud, and can make those we care about proud. # We believe that truth, justice and compassion are requirements for living. # We believe that love is better than hatred, understanding is better than prejudice, and that if there is ever to be a better world, people of widely differing beliefs will have to help each other build it. # We believe that, down deep, all people of goodwill hold these same beliefs and that every individual should feel encouraged to develop a fulfilling philosophy of life. One Church. Many Beliefs.

Take the Beijing Wok, for example. I had driven by the small Chinese restaurant many times without noticing it in a strip mall in far Southwest Austin. Then a friend told me about it one day, describing several dishes she loved. It wasn't long before I was driving back down Brodie Lane -- this time to eat. For starters, we ordered the Steamed Dumplings ($3.95) and the Special Wonton Soup for Two ($3.95). The half-dozen dumplings, made with a thick dough surrounding a small core of pork filling, were served with a sweet-spicy dipping sauce made with chicken stock, soy and red chili sauce. The large bowl of flavorful soup (enough for 1 1/2 servings each) was awash in broccoli, carrots, zucchini, snow peas, mushrooms, sliced chicken breast and several wontons filled with the same pork stuffing as the dumplings. For entrées, we had the Beijing Wok Beef ($6.95) and the Sesame Chicken ($7.50). The beef was sliced and stir-fried with julienne bamboo shoots in the chef's special brown sauce that contained a healthy dose of garlic. The tender meat was garnished with sliced red bell peppers and thin strips of green onions. Small nuggets of chicken were deep-fried and then sauteed in a spicy brown sauce with sesame seeds, resulting in crunchy little sweet bites that finished with a nice heat. A dozen broccoli florets formed an arc on one side of the plate. Although completely different in approach and technique, the two entrees had one significant factor in common: the sauce treatment. Neither was swimming in thick, gloppy sauces that many Americans seem to love. When the beef was spooned onto another plate, there was virtually no trace of sauce on the serving plate. While there was more evidence on the chicken plate, all that remained was enough of the light sauce to mop up with a broccoli floret.

Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium	1701 Red River St.	\N	Austin	78768	TX		30.2763899999999992	-97.7324200000000047	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	185265	austin360	23507		As Texas football moves into the 21st century, Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium continues to evolve as a state-of-the-art facility at the forefront of college football. Expansion plans are already in place for the north end zone, which will feature and upper deck, club seating, an academic center and a war memorial plaza for the 2008 season. The expansion is expected to increase the stadium’s capacity to over 90,000, and add approximately 2,000 club seats and 44 suites. More immediately, two major upgrades have been made for the 2006 season, including a new video board and temporary bleacher seating in the south end zone, which has expanded the stadium's capacity by over 4,000 seats to a total of 85,123. The scoreboard is the nation’s largest high-definition video display board thanks to DAKtronics. The $8-million Prostar Video Board is 55 feet high by 134 feet wide and will offer complete flexibility, with the capability to show one large single video image, multiple video images, and a combination of live or recorded video with real time scores and stats, out of town game information, sponsors’ messages, graphics and animation. In the past year, the stadium has also had renovations to the press box, the Carpenter-Winkel Centennial Room and the interior of the Moncrief-Neuhaus Athletic Center, most notably to the players' lounge. It is all part of an ongoing $150-million renovation project at the Longhorns’ stadium. The stadium's last renovations came in August 1999 with the removal of the track and the lowering of the field by six feet to allow the addition of several rows of seats. It was part of a $90 million-plus project that included removal of the artificial turf from the stadium, the construction of Frank Denius Fields practice facility, the Red and Charlene McCombs Softball Field, the Mike A. Myers Track and Soccer Stadium and extensive remodeling of Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium/Jamail Field and the Moncrief-Neuhaus Athletic Center. The first stages of the ambitious project were completed in 1996. They included the installation of a sophisticated grass playing field in the stadium and the completion of the Frank Denius Practice Fields. Progress continued in 1997 with the addition of 14 stadium suites on the west side. The first major construction to the facility since the upper deck was added in 1972 also included a total remodeling of the underside of the stands, including a new concession plaza and a visitors' locker room in the northwest corner of the stadium. The changes that took place at Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium for the 1998 football season included the addition of a 5,000-seat upper deck on the east side. The massive construction included 52 new stadium suites and a 13,000 square-foot private club room. In the Moncrief-Neuhaus Athletic Center, significant expansion and upgrades included a new locker room, training room, trophy room, players’ lounge, football academic center and an addition almost doubling the space in the strength and conditioning area. The football coaching and academic staffs were moved to the facility, housing the key elements of the entire football program in a single complex for the first time. The 1999 Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays saw the dedication of the 20,000-seat Myers Track and Soccer Stadium, which includes a parking garage that serves students as well as game attendees. The facility is directly across the street from the east side of the football stadium. The final phase of the construction began shortly after the 1998 season ended, when the 75-year-old stadium floor was excavated to a depth of six feet to allow a reconfiguration and addition of seats and the removal of the track to provide a more intimate football setting.

At that time we were in other careers (real estate and art), so the farming was a week-end adventure. We were also raising our three children and none of them wanted to be seen with a hoe in their hands! By 1991, towards the end of the Texas "depression," we decided we might as well follow our dream full-time. The children were just about grown, and besides, what did we have to lose? Art prices had bottomed out and the real estate bust had turned Larry into a house remodeler. Thus we began farming the Milam county farm, growing cool weather crops (carrots, lettuce, broccoli, etc.) and hot weather crops (tomatoes -- lots of tomatoes! -- squash, cucumbers, etc) which we sold at a small farm stand on a street corner near our home. The reception from passersby was exciting. Although we had to explain the word "organic," all the customers understood "fresh"! In 1992 we were able to buy, after much creative financing, the five acres and historic old house in East Austin, which, with the Gause farm, became Boggy Creek Farm, named after the creek/ditch across the street. (Many farms are named after creeks, it seems.) Surrounded by housing subdivisions, schools, and commercial enterprises, which had been built on land once part of the farm, our Austin farm became one of the few truly urban farms in the nation. Today we intensively cultivate the urban farm and also our country farm. At the Gause farm, we grow our main tomato crop, potatoes, onions, hard squash, summer squash, and other items we need in abundance. Specialty and salad crops, plus flowers, are grown in Austin. While the majority of our produce is sold from our farm stand at the Austin farm, a good amount of summer produce is available at our neighborhood Whole Foods Market, which is located about three miles from the farm. We are both native Texans: I was born in Goose Creek, now Baytown, near the Gulf of Mexico, grew up in San Antonio, came to UT Austin, and stayed. My early career was as an artist, painting and producing prints of still lifes, wildlife, and Texas landscapes. Larry was born in Galveston and lived the first part of his life in Gause, farming and running cows with his parents. He's the real farmer of the two of us; I clean up the details. After Vietnam, Larry came to Austin and had careers in television/electronics and real estate/remodeling. We both speak Spanish. It's curious how all the things we've been come together in this passion for farming! For farming in Texas requires a bit of mechanics as well as art, and it's certainly helpful to be bilingual.

Although Pacha's raison d'&#234;tre is much more than just coffee, it could easily become a regular stop-over on any coffee-lover's list. Pacha means earth in Quechua, the language spoken among the indigenous populations of Bolivia and Peru. These two South American countries are the origin of the arts, crafts, and textiles hanging for sale on the walls and behind the glass in the display cases. You can get a closer look at these goods while simultaneously enjoying the specialty coffee drink of the house, cold Pacha latte. It contains ingredients from a secret house recipe and although it is slightly more expensive than regular iced latte, I thought it worth the extra coins (double iced latte $2.50, double Pacha latte $3.10). Don't start your diet the same day you visit Pacha though, because you'll want to try a slice of the decadent-looking apple-blueberry crumb pie ($2.50) or buttermilk chess pie ($2.25). If you're in at lunchtime, you can order a lunch special such as pasta salad or quiche with soup or an empanada, all for $4.50, or order individual items like Bolivian cornbread with spinach/hazelnut/curry soup. The menu also has items like teas, chais, smoothies and juices. In addition to satisfying your thirst, hunger, and cravings for sweets, Pacha also plans to include events on the weekends, such as story-telling for children and live music performances. Call them or drop by for more information about weekend activities. Pacha's hours of operations are 7 a.m. - 7 p.m. weekdays, 8 a.m. - 7 p.m. Saturday, and 8 a.m. - 6 p.m. Sunday. They accept Mastercard and Visa, but not checks. -- Shannan Yarbrough, Austin 360 Staff

Gilmore said a fix was already in the works and that they'd underestimated the space's cooling needs, which makes his A.C. guy the only person in town who misjudged just how hot Barley Swine would become. It's hot enough that Food & Wine magazine named Gilmore one of its Best New Chefs, not just for Barley Swine but for his Odd Duck Farm to Trailer, where I first had a taste of what he could do with Central Texas' best artisan produce. He made the transition from wheels to brick walls with ease in December, trading paper boats for white china and a screened-in grill box for an open kitchen tiled in smooth subway black. Weathered accents of chalky-red wood echo the farmhouse connections. Odd Duck is still in business under the care of Gilmore's brother, Dylan. (See review. ) Their father is Jack Gilmore, who owns Jack Allen's Kitchen in Oak Hill and who played a formative role at Z'Tejas, where Bryce Gilmore got some early experience before culinary school in San Francisco and subsequent jobs at Wink and Cafe 909 in Marble Falls. Barley Swine is a tribute to Gilmore's twin passions for beer and pork. Any place that treats beer with the same respect as wine gets my instant gratitude. Through 16 dishes across my visits to Barley Swine, I started with glasses of chewy Kraken barleywine and malty Real Heavy ale from Real Ale, soft Le Merle saison from North Coast and a mouthy, wheaty IPA from Lagunitas. Was the Kraken worth $10 for a nine-ounce glass, or the saison $8 for 12 ounces? All day long, because you're getting top-of-the-list beers for what you'd pay for low- and mid-list wines by the glass. Our waitress doubled as a beer steward one night to find a wine-sized bottle of Ommegang Rare Vos ale ($19) whose copper-colored depth and dry-fruit finish worked with our pork belly, lamb and pig trotter dishes, with just enough body left for dessert. That dessert was a $7 plate of boutique candy textures, with the subtle crunch of hazelnut and layered chocolate, chewy white blooms of nougat and an avenue of fluffed caramel pudding. Rolled up as a candy bar, it would convert every Snickers lover on the planet. Before you eat, there are things you should know. The menu changes often enough that some of the food in this review is by now just a fond memory. When they recommend three dishes per person, that's about right. And so the two of you will spend about $70 for six dishes and a dessert to share. They don't take reservations, and you will most likely sit with people you don't know. The other four seats at your six-top table might fill up with strangers three times during dinner. It's uncomfortably communal and loud if you're not in the mood for a blind-date dinner party with a bill at the end. Or it's refreshingly social, as it was one night when we shared a big bottle of Black Metal Imperial Stout ($23) with our neighbors. It's a surprisingly dull-witted beer from Austin's Jester King, so out of balance you'd think it got drunk on its way out of the bottle. But it stirred up the kind of beer-geek crosstalk that resonates with the homebrewer in me. And if you try to gather all the flavors from any one dish onto your fork at the same time, you're going to need a bigger fork. We all need editors, and a few dishes would benefit from less sensory input. Did pieces of pork belly ($13) with fat heirloom beans and their refried cousins really need octopus? No, just as a dish of grilled squash with goat cheese ($9) could have won a farmers market ribbon with or without chewy pieces of pancetta. But a place with "swine" in the name has a job to do. Even so, did toned nuggets of luscious sweetbread with Brussels sprouts ($13) and a nice schmear of garlic really need bacon? It's more a question of desire rather than need, but yes they did. And that's the genius of Barley Swine. Take all that farm-fresh feel-good and dangle it from the balcony of its comfort zone. Who knew that the twang of pine nuts could push lamb with artichokes and olives ($14) into a new spectrum of Mediterranean sunlight? Or that the only thing spaghetti carbonara had been missing all these years was the sweet crunch of apple? That's what a dish of pasta stuffed with smoked fish and potato ($10) made us think of, with bouncy pockets of macaroni releasing their cure-house vapors against a backdrop of soft-scrambled egg. The Swine works magic with eggs, even when they're just part of a golden dressing under grilled asparagus and pickled Gulf shrimp ($9). A soft-boiled egg rescues a disc of fried pig trotter ($11) from losing its soul under a crunchy fried shell. Some of the best dishes were also the simplest: feather-crisp leaves of Brussels sprouts with lemon ($5), a salad of grilled sweet carrot slices with goat feta ($7), the slow heat of pink peppercorn ice cream in a dessert like exploded strawberry shortcake ($7), sweet seared scallops with tart shellfish butter and white asparagus ($14). Conversely, some of the sexier-sounding plates made plainer impressions. A starchy piece of Spanish tortilla was a heavy-thumbed hitchhiker on a rarefied dish of foie gras ($16). And a dish of braised short rib with celery and beets ($14) made another argument for giving the short rib a rest until we can convene a flavor-standards council, although it made me rethink my ongoing staring contest with cooked celery. Across nights of plates eaten down to the shine, only a bacon-wrapped rabbit dish ($14) moved us to push it away. It was the salt, and when our waitress took notice, the manager made another stop at our table, like he'd done for the happier plates. The dish came off the bill, and we gave the rabbit another shot on another night, this time expressed as a lean grilled terrine ($11) with rings of sweet onion, baby radishes and luxurious bacon-liver mousse. The smooth recovery was another of the tricks up Barley Swine's tattooed sleeve. For a place with the atmosphere of a well-mannered bar, the service experience is deceptively complete: good dishes and flatware cleared at each course, easy familiarity with a complex menu and a waitstaff comfortable with chatter about farm sourcing and pro wrestling alike. One is real, bruises and all; the other comes with colorful costumes. You decide which is which. msutter@statesman.com; 912-5902

Zilker deeded the 35 acres surrounding Barton Springs to the City of Austin. In 1932, Zilker agreed to give the military school established during the First World War an additional 330 acres, joining the 35 acres on the north side of the original tract if the city would buy the acreage from the school for $200,000. This action was approved in a bond election and despite the ecomomic depression of the 1930's. the land was developed into Zilker Park. The National Park Service assisted with the planning of Zilker Park and construction was performed by many groups, including workers from Reconstruction Finance Corporation's relief program, the Citizens Works Administration, and the Civilian Conservation Corps.

It is sweet, fruity and nutty with a caramel butter finish. Preparation is of utmost importance to us. Our espresso machine is a La Marzocco FB 80 (3 group). We pull 1.5-2 oz of espresso at 24 to 26 seconds in 18 gram baskets. Espresso machine maintenance is a high priority, which is why we back flush at noon, evening, and a deep clean at night. This ensures that espresso residue does not build up and taint the product. All our coffee is French pressed and served at optimal temperature. Our daily house coffee is the Spicewood 71 Classic blend. It is a well-balanced and classic coffee. We will also press any of the single-origin whole-bean coffees we have for retail. Our selection of single-origins usually includes 5 to 7 sustainable, direct trade coffees. Coffee education is very important to us. We invite all coffee lovers to share our pursuit of excellent coffee by participating in cuppings at the store and by attending various coffee events in this region. In this way we hope to promote interest in the specialty coffee industry and heighten appreciation for all the hard work that goes into creating a truly remarkable coffee. We strive for the highest quality in every cup.

The two men, very different yet surprisingly compatible, have established themselves as entrepreneurs with one collective vision, to run the nation's premier family of seafood restaurants. The history of McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurants began when Bill McCormick purchased Jake's Famous Crawfish Restaurant located in Portland, OR., and brought the more than 100-year-old landmark back to life. When asked the secret of how he revitalized a restaurant on the brink of closing, McCormick says, "I like nothing better than being a good host." In addition to his spirited personality, McCormick has an ability to bring out the best in other's managerial skills and strengths, a combination essential in a successful business. Part of the managerial talent McCormick tapped was Doug Schmick, a management trainee. The two formed a partnership in 1974, creating Traditional Concepts, a precursor to today's McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurants. In 1979, they opened the original McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurant in Portland, Ore. Since that time, the company has expanded to more than 50 restaurants across the country.

Open daily for blue collar happy hour. The Grizzly Bar will be a daily platform for pouring great music in your ear and cold beers in your cakehole. For a buck. Here are some tips when you encounter your first Grizzly Bar in Austin: Grizzly Bars are normally shy of humans and you should quickly get out of its way when it sees you. There are a number of things you can do if you spot a grizzly bar on a trail or one enters your campsite or downtown area. 1. Cautiously approach the Grizzly Bar to get a better look. Grab a stool and quietly drink your whiskey. After settling up, slowly back away while watching the Grizzly Bar and wait for it to focus its attention elsewhere. 2. Bring pepper spray and tip money as a precaution. If the Grizzly Bar bartender is attracted to your food or garbage, you will be hurtin for certain. 3. It is important to keep stiffs away from the Grizzly Bar. The Grizzly can smell a stiff or a square a mile away.

31738	Mizu Prime Steak & Sushi	3001 Farm to Market 620	\N	Austin	78738	TX	(512) 263-2801	30.3915900000000008	-97.9373599999999982	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	1172872	austin360	23669	http://www.mizuaustin.com	Having just opened Sept. 1, Mizu Prime Steak and Sushi moved up the road on RM 620 to a vaulted stone-and-beam cathedral of a building with spectacular views of the hills around Lake Travis. Mizu Prime Steak and Sushi is a world class restaurant over looking the hills of West Austin in Lakeway. Mizu features prime steaks with a full sushi bar and innovative new American cuisine. With both an award winning chef and sommelier, the food and wine shine and are the focus in a beautiful space with miles of breath-taking views of the Hill Country. Mizu Prime Steak and Sushi is open for both lunch and dinner seven days a week. Mizu also offers ala carte brunch on both Saturdays and Sundays from 11:00 AM until 3:00 PM. The mixing of steak and sushi might seem an unlikely pairing of two very different disciplines, but Mizu clearly takes both styles seriously. On the grill side, Mizu brought in Christopher Bauer, the chef who helped launch Finn & Porter at the downtown Hilton Austin. The sushi side is overseen by Tatsuki, whose career includes time alongside Tyson Cole at Uchi. The general manager is Brian Phillips, who worked with Bauer at Finn & Porter and most recently was a wine sommelier at the Driskill Grill. Phillips said Mizu's owners are going for a neighborhood restaurant and bar that offers 'a little bit of everything for everybody.' The menu promises something like that, with nigiri from $2 to $5 per piece, edamame sautéed with garlic and wine for $3, well-portioned sushi rolls such as the classic California and spicy tuna ($8 each) and specialty rolls like the Mclovin' ($12 with crab, peppered tuna, avocado and serrano peppers) and the Mizu ($20, with lobster, Kobe beef and grilled asparagus). From the bistro side, Bauer offers crispy duck confit ($23), Niman Ranch tandoori chicken ($21) and hard-core Kobe rib-eye with a side for $39. At lunch, there's a Kobe burger with fries for $9 and a fried halibut po' boy with a salad for $11, along with pizza, pastas, entree salads and sushi combos. The bar, called Branch, pours a full line of mixed drinks and high-end cocktails, and the wine list reflects Phillips' goal of encouraging experimentation with 'esoteric and value-driven wines, something that's a little bit more fun.'

A short greenbelt topped with a tucked-away park with basketball courts and room to throw a Frisbee. North University Neighborhood Association (NUNA) has adopted the park. In 2007, they were awarded an Austin Parks Foundation grant to purchase and install new trash cans. The group held a large volunteer workday in November, 2007. Mark Feist, project organizer, reports, "It looks like a new park! We took out many dump truck loads of debris and trash from the creek." Before holding the event, Mark worked with the City Parks Department and Watershed Protection to have the area mowed and brush removed. Volunteers were then able to remove rocks and other obstructions to make future mowing easier. This is a great example of how adopting a neighborhood park creates a partnership between the city and the neighborhood. The group held an It's My Park! Day event on April 12, 2008, with 60 neighbors attending.

Yes, they offer a limited selection of coffee drinks, including cappucino, but they also offer cold, organic juices and smoothies, sodas, hot dogs (to go with your organic juice), convenience-store type snacks, and frozen yogurt from the tiny TCBY hiding inside. While you're munching that dog or sipping that spirulina drink, wander around the "market" and discover why it's named so. To your right, a bin full of odd items at discount prices, items such as screwdrivers, sets of colored markers, children's sunglasses, and the like. Over on your left, there's a rack of Austin post-cards geared towards the tourist, or towards the back of the store you can browse through the latest editions of The National Enquirer, People, and The Globe. While there's really nothing extra-special about this establishment, its location, hours, and products within beckon to the 6th St. hordes, whether it be during Monday's lunch hour or Friday night's quest for midnight snacks. It's convenient, it's open, and it's right there. -- Shannan Yarbrough, Austin 360 Staff

Why We Are Different Than Other Companies Specialists. Gurus. Artists. Magicians. Mad scientists. Innovators. We’ve heard them all, but when it comes to describing who we are and what we do, our favorite has got to be “Go-To Guys.” When it comes to our businesses or our clients, we take immense pride in being idea makers, implementers and support team for their needs online. Launching a successful online business or strategy (and making sure it stays successful) isn’t as much an art as it is a science, and the dedicated team at Space Chimp Media has got the solutions you need to grow. With the right mix of advertising expertise, web development, advanced marketing practices and up-to-date social media strategies, Space Chimp Media’s custom approach to internet marketing and 20 years collective experience is your ticket to increased traffic, improved conversion rates and higher ROI for you and your business. Space Chimp Media takes pride in being a one-stop shop for online success. We’re not just a “design firm,” or “search marketing company.” We’re an interactive agency whose most valuable asset is our people. Our online business efforts are driven by four core principles: * Conversions and click-throughs don’t buy your products or services … people do! * ROI is the most important metric to measure when determining success. * If you can’t figure it out, they won’t either. * Common sense ideas are often the most innovative and creative. Who We Are Led by serial entrepreneur, Charles Haggas, the Space Chimp Media team is an uber creative, close-knit group of experts in eCommerce, mobile applications, web design, usability, pay per click, search marketing, online behavior, social media and much more. We are all driven by the same passion that drives the company: meet the needs of people, and ultimately you will meet the needs of your business. We ventured into eCommerce and consulting the way many people do – by starting our own online stores. But for us, simply having an online store wasn’t enough. We wanted more traffic. We wanted more conversions. We wanted increased sales. So we studied and tested and built and designed and tested some more. Today, we share everything we’ve learned over the years with our valued clients. You benefit from our knowledge. You learn from our trials and errors. You can count on us to keep up with the ever-changing landscape of Internet retailing through education, innovation, and perseverance. It’s why we can say with confidence that our expertise delivers the results you’re looking for—every time.

For more information and to RSVP, call: 972.380.3228 Show Presented By: Thompson Fine Art, Inc. 10% of Profits Will Benefit the Memnosyne Foundation; Preserving Mexico’s cultural diversity and history for the future through philanthropic endeavors. “Romancing Mexico” is an exciting Fine Art Photography Exhibit that will feature breathtaking images of the diverse cultures within Mexico, including dances and ceremonies traditional to the Tolteca & Mayan cultures. Artist, Gray Hawn, says: “Anything my lens can capture, my soul can embrace. I needed to feel the spirit, hopes and passions of an entire people. I endeavored to lose myself in their oldest beliefs, their sacred dances, and the wisdom of their Elders.” Thanks to the relationship of the Memnosyne Foundation with those communities, Gray, was given permission to photograph el Dia de Los Muertos (Day of the Dead) in Teotihuacan. Several of these images will be on display, along with many more. Hawn’s work is displayed in the National Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Shakespearean Theatre in London and Epcot Center in Florida. Her fine art is now being highly and internationally recognized and awarded top honors. She has been involved in the creation of 80 magazine covers including Brilliant Magazine, Ultra and Austin Woman. Her work is also included in the Loan Collection of the Professional Photographers of America and in the Smithsonian. Gray’s search for sacred light on six continents has earned her the title of Master Photographer by the Professional Photographers of America. Her art tells stories of Presidents, royalty, diplomats and the Mayan people. Collector’s of Hawn’s work include: President George W. Bush, President Jimmy Carter, Farrah Fawcett, Lady Bird Johnson, Luci Baines Johnson, Tommy Lee Jones, Sophia Loren, Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo, Baroness de Nadine Rothschild, and countless collectors from Texas and around the world.

It also means great quality. The word “irie” is a commonly used word in the Rastafari dialect. For Rastafarians, “I” is the most powerful and significant letter. An “I” makes any word more spiritual and sacred – and “irie” is a perfect example as the ultimate positive. So what does all that mean for the Irie Bean Coffee Bar? It means we want our customers to find their own state of “irie” when they’re in our shop. We want everyone to be at their happiest and we'll offer everything we can to make it so – from great food and drinks to free wireless internet access. Most of all, we offer a friendly and helpful staff who are happy to serve you. So bring your friends to hang out on our charming back patio or curl up on our cozy leather couches with the daily crossword and see what irie is all about. Please join our email list to hear about all our fun events – there’s something for everyone.

Mr. Scheiffer, a relative of the newsman, Bob Scheiffer, was the first manager at Pike’s Place, which was situated at the same location as the current bar, and Pike's sold Falstaff and Schlitz beers by the bottle. In 1950, the bar changed owners and was re-named James Tavern. Then, in 1965, the Longbranch was born during the zenith of the TV series, Gunsmoke. Ben’s BBQ down the street was named the same in 1971. Congress passed a bill urging the TV show to continue and Gunsmoke ran another 10 years until 1975. Our landlords, Howard and Harold, still watch the show daily and have been next door at J and J Drug since 1969. We took over in the summer of 2003, and the bar continues stronger than ever. The old quarter sawn oak bar dates to the 1890’s, and is a big draw at the Longbranch. We are the first to serve cocktails, and we believe we pour some of the best in town.

The outside is a dark gray coffin-shaped cinderblock and the inside is similarly corpse-like - save for the lively and diverse crowd of hipsters, jocks, older bleached-blond women, younger bleached-blond boys and waitresses who look like they sauntered in from Hazzard County. Though Gibson has a full bar (including, presumably, the ingredients required for its namesake drink, even though it's actually named for its cross-street), most people I saw were enjoying cheap cans of Pearl ($1!) and bottles of vinho verde or prosecco (at a decent price for a bar - $15 a bottle). Seated in a cold black booth (or at one of their mausoleum-marble-topped wrought-iron tables), beneath powerful AC ducts, exposed beams and a spidery chandelier composed of black desk lamps, you can order food from the outside trailer. The food has baby names - sammies, tater sticks, trailer sauce - but such cuteness belies its substance. Serious hot dogs, the Trailer Burger (on a doughnut, $7.50), and buttermilk-coated fries ($5) are available, along with a cheese plate ($10) and edamame ($5). Lest you get suckered in by the summery fare and forget that you're in a haunted old revamped automotive repair building, you can top your dog with some `ghost chili' or `ghost mayo' and give yourself the chills.

Seating along the bar is fairly limited, but vacancies rotate enough so that you can probably find a spot sooner or later. Food: Pretty good, as sports bars go. The Safari Salad with grilled chicken was quite tasty. Highs and Lows: High energy, can get pretty noisy. Though people were smoking, it was well-ventilated enough that it probably won't bother all but the most sensitive non-smokers. Drinks and Beverages: Reasonably priced beers. Screens: On a recent Sunday, they had 13 regular-sized TVs going as well as three big screens. Clientele: Not TOO awful rowdy. A few jerseyed fanatics, but probably a slightly larger amount of casual fans. ("That Trent Warner sure can throw, can't he?") On a recent Sunday visit, there was even a child or two hanging around. Fan Bases: Rumored to be a University of Arkansas base. The Dolphins, Vikings and Raiders seemed to be particularly well-represented.

The fried onion strings were oily enough to be noticeable but not enough to dissuade a diner from devouring them. For the main course, my companion ordered the cowgirl's ribeye and I selected the silver spur filet. Both steaks, grilled over mesquite, were tender, moist and cooked to order. ** Moderate. -- Dale Rice, AA-S

Seriously, Austin's appeal is well-known and widespread. In fact, we can confirm its reputation as a casual, friendly town based on our experience since moving here in 2003. But Austin possesses many subtle charms that reveal themselves over time. Creative pursuits are encouraged, local arts are supported, good food and drink are celebrated, and nature is enjoyed — righteous attributes all. After setting up house here in south central Austin, we started exploring both mutual and personal interests — education and fine art (Sarah); music and retail (Joshua). We actually know a little about the entrepreneurial itch — after relocating to San Francisco from Oklahoma in 2001, we helped open the Subterranean Shoe Room. Both a bricks-and-mortar and online store, the Shoe Room quickly blew up, thanks to its reputation for cutting-edge kicks. But it was the store's success with the locals that was particularly sweet. Amazingly, it became a hangout for a large, loyal group of friends and customers — a real blast for us. After moving to Texas, we knew we wanted to start ... something. So we began to plan. Step one, list all the non-negotiable elements for the business we hoped to create: spontaneity, surprise, social intercourse, much art (to meet and support artists, writers and musicians) and daily dealings with the denizens of Austin. Step two, close our eyes, hold our breath and take a giant leap! Ergo, Progress Coffee — a place for food, beverage, art, music and magazines where you can eat, drink, look, listen, read — and hang out for as long as you want. We settled on the central east side for several reasons: proximity to downtown, predictions of growth, support from an enthusiastic landlord, and even a nostalgia factor — the area reminds us of our old Mission neighborhood in San Francisco. Then, with donations of time and sweat-equity from selfless friends, we converted part of a 1942 warehouse into a paragon of Progress. Conceptually, we wanted the café to have a sophisticated, contemporary look and a comfortable, inviting feel. How's the fare? Our coffee is fair trade, organic, shade-grown and custom roasted by hand in small batches. Our food is local and organic, prepared fresh daily (Weekly lunch menus are posted at Progress and in the LUNCH section on this site.) We use only fresh, seasonal ingredients, meaning you'll always find something new to dine on at Progress. So if you're looking for something other than typical fare, make Progress a daily destination — relax, be creative and above all, enjoy.

Norwood Estate, part of the Town Lake Trail, is known for its off-leash dog area. The park includes a double gate, a smaller puppy area and a large, shaded main area. The park has largely been kept clean and green through the hard work of volunteers. Help Keep Norwood Estate Clean - Scoop the Poop. More info on the City's Scoop the Poop web site. Remember, if in doubt, pick it up! We all thank you. Some of the improvements to the park made by volunteers with Friends of Norwood Estate are outlined below. If you are a regular user of this off-leash park, please consider helping out! Sod planted in spring 2006 turned into a solid, luxurious carpet of bermuda grass by summer, withstanding both drought and heavy paw traffic. As the bermuda grass went dormant, the group sectioned off areas and overseeded with winter rye grass. Although not very tough, this provides additional protection for the grounds to survive the winter. A combination of mulch and grass reduces run-off and retains soil moisture. Volunteers built tree boxes, which allowed the park's pecan trees to recover and provide welcome summer shade with healthy leaves. It was only a couple of summers ago that few would venture out in the heat of day, and now the park is enjoyed by many, even when temps topped 100F. Continued mulch spreading has virtually eliminated choking dust and soil compaction. FNEDP is a 2005-06 Neighborhood Park Grant recipient. Funds were used to protect trees and improve sod. The park features a grove of Pecan trees which appeared nearly dead three years ago. Volunteers experimented and found that low wooden walls around the tree deter dogs without detracting from the beauty of the trees. Within a few months of the first "tree box" being built, the tree was fully leafed out and healthy again. FNEDP was also a 2004-05 Neighborhood Park Grant recipient. The grant funds were used to install a double-gated entryway to the park, protecting dogs from escaping onto busy Riverside Drive.

He ordered the beans to burned ( and this is where some historians embellish a bit) and was immediately attracted to their aroma. He ordered to try the beans, liked it, and thought he could out-wit " the devil" by baptizing it as a Christian beverage. And that's how Muslims, Italian merchants and a Pope, helped spread coffee's popularity to the Western World, in a nutshell.

Technology offers a convenient way to connect, which is why I chose to convert this location and engage audience participation with the use of QR codes to create a multidimensional form of social interaction.” The installation is housed in a converted convenience store displaying sketch-art portrait pieces embedded with QR codes. Viewers are encouraged to use their smart phones to scan the QR codes which are linked to the portrait’s Facebook page that has been embellished with a unique persona and identity, often being befriended by other portrait personas, forming a ready-made community. Included with the purchase of each portrait the buyer will receive the administrative rights to a Facebook profile creating an opportunity to collaborate with the artist through cyber medium.

Before and since then he has worked within pop culture, owning skateboard/clothing companies and stores, while also performing music and exhibiting art internationally.

Perry Park was once a limestone quarry so there are many geological aspects to explore. A running track circles the various playing fields and runs along a natural wooded area. This wooded area has its own set of trails. HPWBANA and the Highland Park PTA have done numerous beautification and park improvements, and they always seem to have energy for more! With the help of an APF 2005-2006 Neighborhood Grant the park now has benches. The benches allow parents to take a seat while kids play on the sports fields, and give people running the park?s loop a place to catch their breath. Meanwhile, volunteers continue efforts at thinning underbrush, removing non-native plants and grooming the nature trail through the woods. Recent accomplishments include: Building a nature trail with wide trails, a surface of crushed granite and native plant markers A major repair running track is almost complete thanks to PARD and the HP PTA. Volunteers are working on the fifth major pass at ligustrum removal. HPWBANA held their first ever Movies in Perry Park in the fall of 2006. A large scale tree planting is planned for February. A focus of the tree planting project is the park entrance. Trees and native plants are planned to create a beautiful welcome for park visitors.

His barbecue was world famous feeding governors, senators, presidents and even royalty for over 50 years. My mother, Mopsie Mikeska Cavo worked with him for 35 years. She owned and operated his restaurant and catering business until she sold it in 1997 to open her own catering business, called Catering By Mopsie. With over 45 years of barbecue and catering to the Austin area, Catering By Mopsie is one of the top catering business in the country. Working with my grandfather and mother for 21 years has not only given me tremendous experience and knowledge but also a passion and love for the business. Now, as a third generation of a barbecue dynasty, Blue Ribbon Barbecue is born.

The festive new center suggests a “pavilion in the park” with its asymmetrical shade roof extending far beyond the exterior walls, creating a generous wrap-around terrace. Second story balconies offer some of the best views of the Austin skyline and Town Lake.

Don't dismiss this as food for the sobriety-impaired. If you're going to remember one part of your Sixth Street bender, let it be the smoked bone-in pork chop. Let the running of the osteo-obstacle course to get every scrap of meat be the lone, blinking beacon of what went right that night. Simms and his brother, Darrell, also smoke brisket, ribs and even turkey legs at the trailer. Fried catfish is a big seller at $6 with fries, and sandwiches start at $3. But even at 3 in the morning, a handshake and a few words of blessing are free. -Mike Sutter

The park has extensive playground equipment and a wading pool. It is also a popular site for various Austin festivals; both the Jazz Festival and Eeyore's Birthday Party are held at Pease Park. You can reserve the volleyball courts or the picnic area. Use the link below to find out more about reservations. Austin Parks Foundation Pease Park/Shoal Creek Greenbelt Initiative ? Update: 4/25/2008 50 new Trees and Irrigation Along Parkway Thanks to mitigation funds from Austin Energy for tree removal elsewhere on Shoal Creek Greenbelt, over 50 native trees and irrigation have been installed along Parkway south of 24th St. A few non-native ligustrum and chinaberries have been removed. A new water connection and meters, thanks to the City Parks dept and City Watershed Protection has been installed as well. Beginning Later in 2008: More Invasive Species Removal The Austin Parks Foundation will be hiring Carl Brockman of Natural Texas to come out with his forestry mower and remove and mulch in place another area of invasive species, primarily Ligustrum and Chinaberry on the Greenbelt running from Gaston Avenue up to 29th St. The work will be staged so as not to interfere with more clean water project work about to begin in the same area. More details as to when will be posted here. Demonstration Restoration Plots Monitoring. The Foundation is continuing to monitor the nine demonstration plots in Pease Park, each 82 feet long by 54 feet wide. The plots are allowing us to test different techniques to restore soil health, repair erosion, and enhance germination of native wildflowers and grasses. We?ll continue to monitor these plots for at least a year to determine recommendations for future phases of restoration at Pease and other city parks. While we had a dry fall and winter, as of 4/24/08, recent rains have helped perk up 5 of the nine plots installed and we're beginning to see some good wildflowers and grasses sprout and grow, in addition to the usual ragweed and other common grasses like bermuda. To see the evaluation and recommendations for Pease Park from the LBJ Wildflower Center, click here . Back in October 2007, the parks department began tilling half of the plots. Over 90 volunteers from Dell, Starbucks, College Forward, Central Texas Trail Tamers and the community at large worked on Oct 5, 6, and 9 to pull out rocks, rake the beds smooth, and shovel, haul and rake in Dillo Dirt on 1/3 of each plot. On Friday, October 12, the first of two applications of liquid compost was applied by Sustainable Growth Texas on another 1/3 of each plot. More about liquid compost here . We'll be continuing the work over the next few weeks with additional volunteer groups, with seeding slated for Fri, October 26. Invasive Plant and Tree Removal. Removing invasive, exotic plants is an important step in the restoration of a natural landscape. During the summer, we hired certified arborist Carl Brockman of Natural Texas to remove non-native and dead trees in Pease Park using a forestry mower. He worked for over a week cutting down and grinding up invasive trees and dead cedars. Despite the heavy rain this summer, most of the invasives have not re-sprouted?but hardy, native understory plants have, as shown in this photo. The mulch from the cut and mulched trees has formed a great thick blanket that is protecting the soil but is also allowing for new growth to sprout. The understory at Pease Park, after non-native trees were removed to allow light and nutrients to reach existing native plants. Note the growth of Turk's Cap, a hummingbird food source.

It's a good Texas-style spot, which the checked tablecloths and memorabilia-filled walls accentuate. While the original Springhill is in Pflugerville, this East Austin-area spot has been producing those good O-rings for several years. Linda believes the longevity of the restaurant is due to the consistency of the menu and their treatment of customers as if they are family. As their ad says, if you love seafood, you'll be in heaven here. The choices include fried or grilled catfish fillets, shrimp, oysters or the seafood feast which includes gumbo, shrimp, oysters and catfish. Other favourites are the Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken. Both are served with creamy country gravy, French fries and Texas toast. The Hamburger Baskets are huge, juicy burgers served with hand cut fries.

The restaurant first took shape in 1975 when Jeffrey Weinberger and Ron and Peggy Weiss, friends from student days at the University of Texas, pooled their interests, talents, and enthusiasm with three other pals to open an intimate neighborhood bistro in Austin, such as they had encountered in their travels. They were part of the first wave of new American cuisine, and over the years they made their mark with an original flair that is unmistakably Jeffrey's alone.

Starving Art Studios and EAT Park and Eatery is here. This is a place where people can see, take part of, purchase and even eat, some of the unique creative aspects of Austin, Texas. We have brought together various aspects of our creative community into one place so that people can come and enjoy. We are open to people of all ages and persuasions. Bring your families, bring your friends, bring your lovers, bring whomever you want, during the day and occasionally into the night. Starving Art's galleries will provide opportunities for local artists that are living and working in Austin and the area at large. The trailers will work together with the galleries and the arts market to provide a bigger draw for people to come to this area, therefore giving artists more exposure. Likewise the art openings will create a draw that will also give the trailers exposure. Most galleries are only able to produce one event a month, therefore only able to offer 12 shows a year for artists. With only a handful of DIY galleries, and a plethora of artists, it is very limited for the local artist to find opportunities to show outside of bars, cafés, or boutiques. We want to provide a community of artists with a place to have other artists to talk to and work with. It is our goal to give them chances to show in our galleries, and sell in our market. We have come together to make a big scene. We want the people to find us to fill their need and desire for art in their lives. Please come and visit. Galleries and Market Hours: Saturday and Sunday 11am-3pm Coming Soon! Event Programming Designed To Amaze! From movie viewings, to musical acts, the East Austin Trailer Park and Starving Art Studios will give you the entertainment and thought provoking arts you are looking for. Come and eat, see, and basically hang out. More Details Coming Soon. We are looking for artists and patrons, art lovers and supporters; this thing is big and we know you want to be a part.

How many nightclubs open with that tagline? More importantly, how many nightclubs actually live up to the word 'premier'? Sure, you can string up a few lights and hire a trained gorilla in a cheap suit to guard the door, but that won't make you 'premier' by any stretch of the imagination. Step into a unique world of culture and sophistication at Merkaba. This avant-garde themed nightspot is the talk of North Austin; its got the convenience of nearby IH-35 combined with the elegant panache of a Warehouse District club...without the traffic and parking (!) headaches. How many other nightspots (quickly) can you name have an actual Baby Grand Piano, not some electronic contraption that makes piano sounds. How many other nightspots offer revolutionary fusion cuisine at an unbeatable price? What does that phony British tavern/meat-market in the strip mall offer the purveyor, a happy hour seven days a week or a cluster of uniformed clones whose goal is to terrify patrons into behaving? We are the new nightspot (hint, hint!) and should be included prominently into your next 'pub crawl'! Every club offers the customer 'ambience' and 'atmosphere' and 100 other worn-out 85 cent words. We at Merkaba have thought long and hard about what's missing in Austin's nightly secene and have devised a welcome for you that we're sure you won't find anywhere else. Merkaba is a place you can dress 'to the Nines' or come as you are. Our diverse audience mirrors that of the rich Austin scene itself. We at Merkaba are aware that you, the discriminating nightclub patron seek only the finest musical talent. Our managers have sought out the best and brightest musical talent that our vibrant community has to offer. Our care and thorough selection brings out the best in our bands, guaranteeing you an experience you won't soon forget. Other nightspots offer a menu. So do we. Our board of fare will stand toe-to-toe with any local establishment in our price range. Our staff is engaged in an ongoing and tireless pursuit of the most innovative fusion dishes available. Why 'eat' what a 'cook' just thawed out when you can dine on a sumptous feast that a highly-trained chef created? It doesn't matter where you start out, we are quite sure you will end up here. At Merkaba. Where it's Really Happening.

Quietly opening in early March, the new kitchen and lounge concept is brought forth by Michael Girard of Girard Diversified Investments, whose other Austin contributions include Imperia, Speakeasy and Terrace59. A distinct, sophisticated space, TenOak is bringing Southern hospitality to the Warehouse District. Girard, who designed the space himself, shows his Austin roots as the entire space is inspired by a Texas oak tree. TenOak is a tribute to the interior of an oak barrel with special details like the growth ring laden tabletops and dim lighting, to the bottom of the bar lined with copper baseboards, an homage to the copper still. Boasting the largest covered patio on Colorado Street, the neighborhood standout impresses at every level. The largest small batch bourbon collection in Austin calls TenOak home, so it should be no surprise that the bar hangs its hat on its spirits selection. From its diverse bourbon and whiskey offerings, which include Black Maple Hill, Four Rose and Garrison Brothers, to its cocktails, the flavor and quality is unmatched. The cocktails, aptly titled elixirs, provide the heat while house-carved ice cubes keep drinks cool, majestic indeed. Sure to be standouts include the Pop-Rock-Tini; Bacardi Razzamatazz, Bols Peach Scnapps, cranberry, pineapple and topped with Prosecco in a Pop Rock candy rimmed glass($TK), TenOak Mule; Jamison Irish Whiskey, ginger beer, and housemade basil simple-syrup with candied ginger, served on the rocks ($TK) and the Manly Cocktail; bourbon infused with maple syrup and bacon ($8). Not to be upstaged by the spirits collection, Beer Monger, Luke Morrison, has put together an impressive list of craft brews on tap, which includes Jester King Black Metal Imperial Stout, Wytchmaker Rye IPA and Commercial Suicide Oaked Dark Mild; Live Oak Primus Seasonal and Thirsty Planet Thirsty Goat Amber Ale. The concept of TenOak’s menu, under the direction of Executive Chef James Roller, is small plates designed to be shared among friends. The charmingly Texas-inspired menu is comprised of bold, thoughtful flavor combinations. The $10 or less price point encourages guests to sample a variety of the craveable creations. Signature dishes include the Fig in a Pig; lightly grilled figs stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped in bacon ($9.95), Tempura Battered Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich; fried, crispy and served with bourbon maple butter ($6.95) and Braised Pulled Pork Sliders; Jester King braised and served on a wheat bun with housemade creamy coleslaw ($8.95). Diners will also enjoy Texas State Fair worthy dessert options like the Drunkie Twinkie; a battered Twinkie, fried and served with Live Oak “big bark” ice cream ($4.95) and Chocolate Chip Cookie Sandwich; Amy’s Mexican Vanilla ice cream, served with a bourbon caramel sauce ($5.95). The masculine space is lined with rich, brown leather furniture; set against the unique finish of burn treated, wood paneled walls, creating a backdrop for the expansive couches and booths. Designed for living room style gatherings over cocktails or the big game, oversized couches and reclining bar seats with wheel bases make group congregations ideal.

It is the newest addition to the El Chile Restaurant Group, which also includes the Manor Road location of El Chile Café y Cantina, El Chilito Tacos y Café and the Red House Pizzeria. After a brief stint in catering and 16 years at fine dining restaurant Jeffrey's, Chef Alma Alcocer joins the El Chile team to make the restaurant her own. "I'm most excited to have Alma working with me," said Carlos Rivero, who owns all four of El Chile's restaurants and worked with Alcocer at Jeffrey's. "I decided to dedicate one of our spaces to her and her menu because I love her food." Alcocer is originally from Mexico City and studied at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris before coming to Austin in 1989. "The concept is for (Alcocer) to provide her interpretation of Mexican food as she either grew up eating it or as entrées that she would make in her own household," said Maribel Rivero, the restaurant group's marketing director. El Alma serves both lunch and dinner, and its menu showcases a variety of spices and flavors, including jicama, pineapple and mango. It also serves a weekend brunch from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. Owner Rivero recommends the chile relleno with shrimp and chipotle tomato sauce. -- Michelle Cerulli

While you can't pick and choose from the antiques, you can pick from an abundant selection of coffee and an extensive beer and wine list. Step inside the poster-covered door and you'll find an antique cigarette and Coke machine, clocks, radios, and statues. The outdoor seating is perhaps the most interesting part, with mismatched garage sale chairs and tables and hanging holiday lights swooping down from the tree branches. There's an old motorcycle parked close to the outdoor stage, where a variety of local musicians play. The customers seem to be just as eclectic, with artists, musicians, students and many others whose appearance screams individuality. This coffee shop is all about change. The newest addition is the outdoor bar. Happy Hour is between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. each day, with $.50 off all beer. The prices are very reasonable. House coffees are only $.92 and include House, Kenya and Decaf. The Spider Bite is a jumbo cup of coffee with a shot of espresso. I would recommend the Mocha Latte, topped with whipped cream, and the Mocha Blanca, a white Ghiradelli chocolate latte. Other than the wide selection of java, Spider House has smoothies, shakes, Italian sodas, Jolt and Orangina. The cool thing about Spider House is that you don't have to take off when you get the late night munchies. There are always about four or five entree choices, from Tamales by Golly and the Pasta Plate to the Mayberry Bagel, named after a Spider House employee. The prices of the entrees range from $2.95 to $4.95. The parking lot behind the shop is small, but you can park next door at the old plasma center, or parallel park along Fruth or West, but the laid-back atmosphere and night breeze of Spider House will make looking for a space well worth it. And who knows, maybe the employees will let you buy that antique table after all. By Kat Lyon, Austin 360 Staff

We'll call that place Frank, which opened quietly this month at 407 Colorado St.\\n\\nDaniel Northcutt, who was director of operations for Starlite among other things, has joined with restaurateur and Starlite principal Michael Terrazas to form what Northcutt says is the ideal place for a cheap hot dog and a can of Schlitz beer or an artisanal sausage and a glass of wine. 'High-end lowbrow' is the phrase he used, and he swears he was drinking a Schlitz as we talked. On purpose. They're joined in the venture by Northcutt's wife, Jenn, and Geoff and Yancy Peveto. In the kitchen, Matt Helms (who was in charge of feeding the Carolina Panthers football team) is executive chef, and Austin nightclub veteran Tania Roberts is the bar manager.\\n\\n\\nThat management roster will oversee a menu that includes a loaded Chicago dog for $3.75 (complete with bright green relish and sport peppers), a Jackalope dog for $7 (antelope and rabbit sausage on a Phoenicia baguette with huckleberry compote) and waffle fries starting at $2.50. Daily specials will feature gourmet sausages made in-house or on special order by Hudson's Meat Market.\\n\\nAt the bar, an inventive roster of 16 cocktails incorporates curiosities such as bacon-infused Maker's Mark, Boylan's cream soda and prosciutto, and the beer list runs from Pearl to Live Oak.\\n\\nFor now, Frank is serving breakfast (beignets, chicory coffee, German pocket pastry), lunch and dinner six days a week, with a late-night menu until 2 a.m. Thursdays through Saturdays. On the horizon is a Sunday brunch and a tightly stocked grocery store, what Northcutt calls a 'super-focused, tiny Whole Foods,' with cookbooks, gifts and staples from toothpaste to toilet paper.\\n\\n— Mike Sutter

Canoers and kayakers often take advantage of the shores and nearby parking. A short loop trail is great for walking with your dog and the point is a great place to watch your dog swim. Bern Abplanalp, Friends of Red Bud organizer, gave the following report of their recent weekend volunteer day: The benches have been installed at Red Bud. They look great! Before we had the last one bolted down, people were already using the them. Lots of compliments and ?thanks? from park users today. The kiosk is also complete and we?ve posted our first set of information, which people seem to be reading. In fact, the notes about picking up at least 1 dog poop if you bring a dog to the park may be having an impact already. It seemed to me that an inordinate number of people were actually using poop mitts today and one of the trash cans (the one nearest the parking lot) was literally filled to the brim with used poop bags. I?ve never seen this before, so it?s something to watch in the coming weeks. We've posted some pictures on our blog, austinparksfoundation.blogspot.com Goals of Friends of Red Bud Isle (formed in 2007) include: Spreading mulch in areas worn by dog traffic. Poison ivy control (keeping it clipped down) Dead brush clean up throughout the park Removal of invasive plants throughout the park, particularly at the park entrance. Water access steps for dogs, similar to what has been done at Auditorium Shores. These should match the natural look and feel of the point. Erosion control on the point. Repair of the kayak ramp. Installation of 2 more poop bag stations. Installation of a kiosk. Various dog-related upgrades (drinking water, small dog play area, behavior signs, etc.) Installation of a few more benches. Installation of a drinking fountain. others... Help Keep Red Bud Isle Clean - Scoop the Poop. More info on the City's Scoop the Poop web site. Remember, if in doubt, pick it up! We all thank you.

West Austin Park is home to one of Austin's few fenced off-leash dog areas, now newly revamped (August 07). There's plenty for non-dog owners to enjoy, too, including pool, playscape and more. The volunteer "Canine Social Club" has raised funds to improve and maintain the off-leash area. As of August, 2007, the off-leash area renovations are substantially complete. Beautiful native rock work, terracing, and lots of seating have been added, creating a wonderful place for neighbors and their canine companions to socialize. Thanks to all who have contributed money or volunteered time to help this effort. This group has raised over $13,000. through neighborhood fund raisers, donations and City grants. The renovations will likely use all of this money and possibly more. The Canine Social Club seeks volunteers to spread mulch and do some planting, etc. If you would like to participate please contact Sandra Grimes (with Mozart) in the park or call 472-3774.

The organization prepares children for success in kindergarten through specialty programs designed with age appropriate activities, focused on the developmental learning and social skill growth of each child. Family owned and operated in Central Texas since 1970, The Children’s Center of Austin is a family-focused operation with an open door policy and a commitment to work closely with parents for the welfare of the whole family. With the lowest child to teacher ratio in Austin, The Children’s Center of Austin’s in-house developed curriculum is tailored to meet each child’s individual development needs. Class size is the most important factor in education quality; therefore The Children’s Center of Austin keeps pre-kindergarten class sizes four to six students smaller than most preschools. The Children’s Center of Austin offers learning activities with separate classrooms and areas for art, gym, library and reading, computers, Spanish and a highly monitored and secure swimming pool. With curriculum designed to stimulate learning and promote social skills, children rotate through rooms and activities so are not confined to one room all day. Additionally, The Children’s Center of Austin is the only preschool offering twice monthly field trips or in-house activities throughout the school year and daily field trips during its summer camp session. The Children’s Center of Austin places strong emphasis on teacher training, providing its staff with opportunities for professional growth and development, including in-house training and participation in curriculum planning. The Children’s Center of Austin currently serves the Austin, Texas area with locations in Bee Caves, Jester and Steiner Ranch.

As now. During the days of the British Raj, it was the first port of call for steamships touching India. It reigned over the Bombay Province with the same verve and vigor which endures today.The Bombay Province included Sind (now in Pakistan), Gujarat, Hyderabad-Deccan, the district of Karnataka and the towns bordering Goa. It was an age of elegance, of sunlit days and starry nights, imbued with the ceremony of empire and a graciousness characteristic of the time. It was an age of grand dinners known as Burra Khanas, of Shikars and cold weather tours and Khansamas, or expert cooks, who produced an astonishing variety of English food and traditional Indian dishes in Dak bungalows. Above all, it was an age which witnessed a spectacular intermingling of peoples, cuisines, customs and traditions.Indian cuisine can be enjoyed as much during the cooking process as during meal time. The aroma from cooking spices, herbs, onions and garlic creates the best kind of potpourri. Indian cooking is basically stove top cooking with the knowledge of how and when to use these spices to bring out their charismatic aromas. In addition, history trails the exotic style of grill cooking over charcoal in the clay ovens, traditionally known as the Tandoors. Major culinary influences result from significant historical invasions throughout India's history.These resulting fusion of customs, lifestyles, cuisines and traditions give Bombay it's distinctive and unparallel style. Bombay Bistro has captured a flavor of Bombay that reflects its draw from the very finest of India's exciting and varied cuisines. Here you will find the sumptuous cuisine of Moghul Emperors, wholesome Punjabi fare, commonly known as the robust cuisine of the North – West frontier…The earthly delights of the Thundra, the clay ovens and the seafood treasures of Goa's golden coast. Vegetarian cuisine is widespread, resulting fro

Volunteers pour heart, soul, and a lot of sweat into making this park a great place for pooches and people. It is the southern terminus of the 3.5 mile Bull Creek Greenbelt trail. Bull Creek Foundation has 32 square miles of ecologically unique terrain to tend and protect. Bull Creek watershed includes limestone seeps, springs, and waterways; scenic cliffs and waterfalls; interesting archaeological and cultural features and more. The park is one of Austin's dedicated off-leash dog parks. It is also the southern end of the Bull Creek Greenbelt Trail, which runs north along both sides of the creek for 3.5 miles to the northern terminus just off of Old Spicewood Springs Road. The Bull Creek Foundation, an all-volunteer affiliate of the Austin Parks Foundation (www.bullcreek.net) has adopted, built and maintained the trail and district park since 1996. In 2005-06, Bull Creek volunteers installed berms and planting areas, planted native plants and watered them, and spread many truckloads of mulch to rebuild the soil and restore the grass that had all but disappeared due to heavy use and drought. On the western (parking lot) side of the creek where the trail begins, there is a memorial stone, bench and kiosk. There, a small native garden area commemorates Inga VanNynatten, who helped greatly with the startup of Bull Creek Foundation and its trail building efforts through her work in graduate school at the University of Texas and later as a employee of the National Park Service's Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance program.

And so, the Y was born. Years passed as people drove to and from work and all the way into Austin to eat. It seemed the highway had done very little for Oak Hill's culinary establishment. Now a second Y is dedicated to making dining in and around the first Y a thing to behold: Nunzia's @ the Y. Overlooking the trees of Williamson Creek, and using Earth friendly materials for construction, Nunzia's @ the Y is proud to be a part of the Oak Hill area, offering a casually upscale experience away from the hubbub of downtown. Our executive Chef has dedicated himself to creating a delicious dining experience for you, our guest, since we first opened our doors. Here at Nunzia's, we cook your food one plate at a time, using the best ingredients around. Fresh fish is flown in daily; we only buy the top eight percent of Certified Angus beef, and we utilize organic produce and the finest products from local growers when available. We are privately owned, and we strive to give you the best dining experience in Oak Hill or anywhere else, for that matter. Welcome to Nunzia's @ the Y.

The potatoes were thick with remnants of the skin, my favorite style, and the green beans were well-cooked with chopped onion that added a nice touch without the heavy salting that plagues so much Southern cooking. On another day, the hand-breaded, fried catfish ($7.50), which was nicely seasoned, was served with plump hushpuppies as well as two vegetables, grilled zucchini and broccoli. The chicken quesadilla appetizer ($4.25), a nod to the predominant cuisine of the neighborhood, was made with large tortillas filled with chicken, melted cheese, green onion and tomatoes. It could easily serve as an entree for a diner with a moderate appetite.The pork chops ($7.50), fried rather than grilled at the suggestion of our server, were flavorful, but only moderately tender.The desserts, a sweet potato pie ($1.29) that was not overly sweet and a red velvet cake ($2) that harked to the 1950s, were delightful.With food that good, it's time that the building stopped morphing. Since the longtime Hernandez Cafe closed two years ago, the space has housed an Italian restaurant and a Mexican seafood spot.Let's hope the third time is a charm.

Taste matters. At Zoot, the belief is that when the best ingredients are chosen with care, respectfully prepared and plated with restraint, the design of the dish becomes at once appropriate and secondary. Great food must engage the senses in such a way as to connect the acts of cooking and serving to the joy of eating as an exercise of the soul. At Zoot, their standard is to make this connection with every plate and to have fun doing it.

However, Turkey Creek trail is an off-leash area, and dogs love splashing in the creek. The trail is about 2.5 miles long and crosses the creek repeatedly. On hot days you are likely to meet more than one wet dog on the trail. Stream bank erosion is a concern in this area, so stay on the marked trails. You'll see exceptionally pretty limestone cliffs, beautifully festooned with moss and ferns in the spring. From Kristy Rollins - report on the 1/12/08 volunteer workday A HUGE thanks to everyone who made it out to our January Turkey Creek workday. What a GREAT turnout with 35 volunteers I think we set a record! A special thanks to Charlie McCabe from Austin Parks Foundation who came once again to help us out. His support of Friends of Turkey Creek (both in the park and with the Foundation) has been phenomenal! There is also a really nice write up about the day on their blog along with more pictures... We cannot forget to thank Albert, Armando and Irving from [Austin Parks and Recreation] Emma Long whose help we would be lost without.... not to mention the tools, materials and serious manpower he provides. Thanks to Kris Troxell who brought so many extra sets of gloves (I still have them if you need them before the next work day) and everyone who brought extra tools. With so many sets of hands, we were able to complete the erosion wall and level the entrance to the first crossing! It looks spectacular (see the pics) !!!!! We were able level and stabilize the opposite side of this crossing for a smoother climb up. We cleared the downed tree at the second or third crossing thanks to Glenn Hall's fancy chain saw! BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE...... The crossing at the "Y" has stepping stones! Poured with love by at least half the team who hauled bags of concrete and tools all that way! BUT WAIT....THERE'S MORE!!!! Remember the area on the alternate side of the "Y" that get impassibly "gooshy" when it rains? Well, it has been "paved" with native stone to prevent the mud pit effect! Yes, what a difference a day (and 35 volunteers) makes! Many of you asked when we could schedule another day. We cannot schedule work days during Warbler nesting season... between March and June so this next one will probably be the last one for awhile. With still so much to do and so little time before the Warbler comes home to Turkey Creek, we are trying to schedule a day in early February. Details coming soon. Thanks so much and see you next month! Till then, Happy Trails, Wagg'n Tails!

Those were the words of 34th Street Café and Catering's owner Eddie Bernal in an American Statesman article. But to many Austin residents, it's more than just a café. It's a place where people come to feel comfortable and have delicious food, to meet old friends or maybe make new ones, or just to relax and get away from a world that invents a new kind of stress every day. Since it's founding in April, 1995, this unpretentious restaurant in central Austin has earned a reputation for moderately-priced food that's carefully prepared with fresh ingredients, a wait staff that's attentive and eager to please, and a warm, homegrown Austin feel. At lunch, customers walk up to the counter to place their orders while in the evenings full table service is offered. Owner Eddie Bernal remarks, "We're not trying to compete with anyone else or to fit into a preconceived format." As he said in an Austin Business Journal interview, "I think that we are losing the flavor of Austin's homegrown restaurants with all the chains that are moving in. I'm just trying to provide my customers with good, fresh food that I hope they'll like." You're invited to come sample the results of Eddie's efforts. Or to order ahead for take-out, call 371-3400.

In 1866 the church was renamed Saint Mary's, and the parish decided they needed a new church and could afford masonry construction. In 1872, after Austin was made the permanent capital of the state, the parish laid the cornerstone for a new church, choosing a location one block north of the original building.

She set out to serve classic Italian cuisine with an occasional subtle twist and she succeeded admirably. In fact, the fundamentals don't get much better than this. The crisp polenta was served with a Gorgonzola cream sauce. The spaghetti Bolognese was a veal-beef-pork ragu cooked in chicken stock with vegetables and a touch of cream at the end. And the flavorful duck confit was served over a potato-fennel gratin with a Madeira-fig sauce. Moderate. -- Dale Rice, AA-S

Javier was a retired diplomat and an accomplished artist-- his art can be seen hanging on the walls of Las Palomas. Amelia traveled Mexico and the world with Javier, gathering recipes and sharpening her skills as a superb chef and hostess. With Javier?s taste and style and Amelia's ability to implement and refine their creations in the kitchen, they produced the unique dining experience of Las Palomas. Las Palomas relishes the essence of this unique dining experience. Mealtime is very important in Mexican culture; it is a time dedicated to the enjoyment of food and family. This unhurried experience cultivates the enjoyment of building family bonds. The recipes are from the interior of Mexico, from Veracruz to Yucatan to Oaxaca. These "heirloom" recipes are several generations old. They are complemented with new offerings that continue the restaurant's commitment to quality and freshness.

"The huge snake logo on the outside of an otherwise nondescript building -- created by Bob "Daddy-O" Wade, best known for the oversize boots that front San Antonio's North Star Mall -- is your first hint that this place might be a bit, well, different. Inside, cowboy kitsch, 1950s diner decor, and Mexican folk art mingle, as do workers from the nearby county offices, local movers and shakers, and anyone else looking for terrific food that, like the decor, defies easy categorization. Call it South Texas gourmet. You can really taste the chipotle chilies in the tartar sauce that comes with some of the best crispy oysters this side of the Mason-Dixon Line, and the Gulf fish tacos are gussied up with chili lime aioli and Tabasco jalape¤o onions. You get the idea -- lots of spicy dishes." Executive chef: Kevin Williamson / Antonio Vidal Dining Style: Casual Elegant Cross Street: 7th Parking: Private Lot

The hot and sour soup and baked mussels were disappointing, while the teriyaki chicken and eggrolls were acceptable. The salmon and eel sushi, as well as the baked salmon and tempura vegetables, were worth a second trip. Forks up. Cheap. -- Dale Rice, AA-S

The misters work. The fans are plentiful. Screens drop to block the sun. Though the entire bar is essentially a covered patio, and though it was a jillion degrees outside, I was comfortable. The zen, vaguely Hotel San José-like rock garden is open — no rooftop. The main bar area has long tables, little tables, quick access to the main bar. The third and final section of the bar looks like the go-to section when it storms or you have a hankering for a more enclosed space: It has a proper roof, air conditioning, and big ol' garage doors that can be closed.- Moira Muldoon, American-Statesman

Great base summer flavors like Tiger's Blood, Strawberry, Banana, Pina Colada and Mango to specialties like Bird of Paradise, Bahama Mama and Pink Lemonade to name a few can be found in the cute little baby blue building with the Frog on the front and sides. Don't miss the shaded seating area and generous parking areas as well. The summer flavors with cream is NOT to be missed. There's even Sugar-Free available in many of the flavors made with Splenda

The platter, a Tex-Mex version of the traditional Asian appetizer, is almost meal unto itself. The two cheese-stuffed peppers were fried and topped with a sweet golden raisin-pecan sauce that was delightful on first bite and tiring by the fourth. The ranchero sauce would have been the better choice. The Sonoran-style stew -- amazingly tender chunks of pork with green chilis in a thick gravy -- was served in a fried tortilla bowl. It was delicious. Overall, it was a good experience. The advice paid off. Forks up. Cheap. -- Dale Rice, AA-S

The shop is not affiliated with the Counter Culture vegan trailer on North Loop Boulevard, but Rosenblath said the businesses have agreed this town's big enough - and different enough - for the both of them.

The primary Cuisine featured is Brazilian, although, some Tex-Mex items are also on hand for the enjoyment of less adventurous Foodies. During her stay in Brazil, Chef/Owner Melba Garcia experienced local home cooking and brought back a variety of delicious and savory dishes which now grace her menu. The Dinner menu has a few more exotic choices than their lunch selections. A must try is a dish that Melba named after the grandmother of one of the homes she visited....Camarao Vo Naica, which is shrimp stewed with a variety of spices and Catupiry cheese. Pair this delicious food with some of their unique wine while listening to amazing live music and you've got a pleasurable dining experience.

In 2005, neighbors planted 20 trees in the park as phase one of the park's master plan. Mike Boyle writes: The neighborhood has taken greater ownership of the park since the tree planting. One neighbor decided on his own to begin working with Parks and Rec to get a drinking fountain in the park. I also received calls from a couple of people in the fall expressing concern about the trees' health [since the leaves were turning brown]. I was happy to tell them that the trees are deciduous and are doing quite well. Some neighbors on the outskirts of the neighborhood said they had never visited the park before, but came by to help plant the trees or to check them out after the planting. They now come to the park on a regular basis.

Now it is a beautiful place to wander along woodland trails. Convict Hill Quarry Park has come a long way since the Austin Parks and Recreation Department first put up a sign identifying the old quarry as parkland in fall 2005. When the sign went up, neighbors took an immediate interest. By the end of the year, Friends of Quarry Park had more than 20 members. When the group began, the park was overgrown and littered with brush and wood cleared from neighboring lots. Now, a visitor to the park will see tranquil, winding trails, well mulched and leveled and lined with rock from the site. All this is the product of volunteer work by neighbors, with the support of the City of Austin Parks Department. In 2007, the group added unique limestone benches, a rock wall along the entry, and wildflower seeds. In 2008, work continues with additional terracing, rock work, and waterfall improvements. Friends of Convict Hill Quarry Park's dedication has won them numerous awards, including two Austin Parks Foundation grants, City of Austin Parks And Recreation Department's Adopt-A-Park Neighborhood Association of the Year, Keep Austin Beautiful's Community Involvement Award, and, for his leadership in developing the park, Jim Turney was named Citizen of the Year by the Oak Hill Association of Neighborhoods.

The CCC Trail has now been cleared from the Town Lake Trail to the end of Elmont Road east of Wickersham. The next section of the Trail runs on Wickersham between Elmont and Riverside Drive.

Over the course of two years, volunteers planted trees, built a path, added native plants, and had a custom sign designed. Austin Parks Foundation was able to assist with fundraising through a Neighborhood Park Grant, but it was the dedication of neighbors that made this park bloom! In 2008, neighbors raised funds to install sidewalk and curbing at Bruning Green. The results look fantastic and make the park accessible to all.

On the grill side, Mizu brought in Christopher Bauer, the chef who helped launch Finn & Porter at the downtown Hilton Austin. The sushi side is overseen by Tatsuki, whose career includes time alongside Tyson Cole at Uchi. The general manager is Brian Phillips, who worked with Bauer at Finn & Porter and most recently was a wine sommelier at the Driskill Grill. Phillips said Mizu's owners are going for a neighborhood restaurant and bar that offers 'a little bit of everything for everybody.'\\n \\n \\nThe menu promises something like that, with nigiri from $2 to $5 per piece, edamame saut&eacute;ed with garlic and wine for $3, well-portioned sushi rolls such as the classic California and spicy tuna ($8 each) and specialty rolls like the Mclovin' ($12 with crab, peppered tuna, avocado and serrano peppers) and the Mizu ($20, with lobster, Kobe beef and grilled asparagus). From the bistro side, Bauer offers crispy duck confit ($23), Niman Ranch tandoori chicken ($21) and hard-core Kobe rib-eye with a side for $39. At lunch, there's a Kobe burger with fries for $9 and a fried halibut po' boy with a salad for $11, along with pizza, pastas, entree salads and sushi combos.\\n \\n \\n\\nThe bar, called Branch, pours a full line of mixed drinks and high-end cocktails, and the wine list reflects Phillips' goal of encouraging experimentation with 'esoteric and value-driven wines, something that's a little bit more fun.'\\n \\n \\n-- Mike Sutter

Since the original store opened in Bastrop, Cartwright's has expanded closer to the Austin area. Beginning with the location off of 290 West and finishing with the newest location in the pristine Southpark Meadows Shopping Center. We have kept the tradition of quality barbecue at Cartwright's alive while adding to the menu more quality sides and our own secret barbecue sauce recipe. From scalloped potatoes to macaroni and cheese, the sides are delicious and compliment the meat well. Cartwright's uses a traditional wood fired pit to smoke the meat and we sell it by the pound or in combo plates. Everything is good, from the brisket to the ribs, sausage and chicken. You'll find the chicken has a great smoky flavor and comes in larger portions than typical barbecue joints. The flavorful brisket comes in both lean and moist cuts. Cartwright's hot sausage is also a favorite, famous from the original Bastrop location. It's tough to find a better value than at Cartwright's. During the week Cartwright's offers daily lunch specials and sandwich combo as low as $6.50. You'll find even more value with their family packs and catering services. Cartwright's specializes in catering and will set you up with a full barbecue spread sure to satisfy the hunger of any large group or social gathering you might have.

We serve a full menu of dinner and drinks to your seat while you watch the movie. The theater is laid out like a traditional movie theater, except every other row of seats has been replaced with a long narrow table for your food and drinks. Those who have never been to the Alamo may worry about disruptions during the movie, but we have devised an ordering system that minimizes interaction during the film, allowing you to order, eat and enjoy the movie with minimal distraction. We recommend arriving early; seating begins 45 minutes before the show and there is always pre-movie entertainment on the screen while you wait for the movie. We have waiters that serve you at your seat; orders before the movie begins are taken in the traditional way. Once the movie starts if you need anything at all, there is paper and pencils at the table, write down what you need on the paper, stand the paper up on the card holder attached to the table. This acts as a flag, your waiter will only come by if he sees the card, otherwise he will stay out of your way so you can enjoy the film.

A local video store owner allowed ColdTowne to launch a Chicago-style long-form improv training center (the first of its kind in Austin) next door to his establishment. Soon ColdTowne was given the opportunity to produce shows at the space. Thanks to the success of see.hear.speak. (a three-day film, art, and comedy event), ColdTowne was given an "audition" to produce shows at a venue for a week. Test Pattern was a success and the group immediately began plans for the grand opening of The ColdTowne Theater. The ColdTowne Theater opened on October 28th, 2006, to a packed audience. The theater is currently open Thursday through Saturday featuring all forms of comedy: improv, stand-up, sketch, film, music, and much more. Nationally recognized acts perform here as well as the best local performers.

A successful $4.8 million expansion campaign was launched in 1997 that led to the creation of the new downtown location at the Dell Discovery Center.

More than 800,000 visitors have enjoyed exhibits and programs since the Museum doors opened at its current home. The mission of the museum is to inspire young children and the adults in their lives to experience the joy of learning through the power of constructive play.

These 1.5 million bats are fun to watch, but they're also making our world a better place to live. When engineers reconstructed downtown Austin's Congress Avenue Bridge in 1980 they had no idea that new crevices beneath the bridge would make an ideal bat roost. Although bats had lived there for years, it was headline news when they suddenly began moving in by the thousands. Reacting in fear and ignorance, many people petitioned to have the bat colony eradicated. About that time, BCI stepped in and told Austinites the surprising truth: that bats are gentle and incredibly sophisticated animals; that bat-watchers have nothing to fear if they don't try to handle bats; and that on the nightly flights out from under the bridge, the Austin bats eat from 10,000 to 20,000 pounds of insects, including agricultural pests. As the city came to appreciate its bats, the population under the Congress Avenue Bridge grew to be the largest urban bat colony in North America. With up to 1.5 million bats spiraling into the summer skies, Austin now has one of the most unusual and fascinating tourist attractions anywhere. The Austin American-Statesman created the Statesman Bat Observation Center adjacent to the Congress Bridge, giving visitors a dedicated area to view the nightly emergence. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people visit the bridge to witness the bat flight, generating ten million dollars in tourism revenue annually.

Stubblefield in Navasota, Texas, as one of nine sons from parents he describes as “real good cooks.” In the 1930′s, Stubb’s family moved to Lubbock, Texas to pick cotton, and it was during this time Stubb learned to cook by working in local restaurants and hotels. Stubb left Lubbock to serve in the Korean War as a staff sergeant in the 96th Field Artillery, the last all-black army infantry, where he was a gunner and a respected leader. Stubb used this time to perfect his culinary skills by overseeing the preparation of daily meals for as many as 10,000 soldiers. After he returned, Stubb eventually opened his first restaurant in Lubbock in 1968, across from the county fairgrounds. He made his first barbecue in the hickory pit behind his place and filled the jukebox with vintage blues music. It was here that Stubb’s Legendary Bar-B-Q was born… In the 1970′s, Stubb’s restaurant became the heart of an explosive music scene. Stubbs was ground zero for musicians like Joe Ely and Stevie Ray Vaughn. Other famous musicians who would “play for their supper” included Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Robert Cray, George Thorogood, Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown, Linda Ronstadt and the Fabulous Thunderbirds. Although small in size, Stubb’s Restaurant was always filled with good friends, great music and plenty of Stubb’s Legendary Bar-B-Q. The Lubbock location is now closed but the legend continues here in Austin at 801 Red River. Come on down for some Live Music, Cold Beer and Great Food!

Our curatorial interests are eclectic, experimental, and wide-ranging. We care deeply about collectors, and are active in educating the public about the joys and rewards of collecting fine photography. We strive to make it accessible to all, working closely with both beginning collectors as well as seasoned ones. Burnes Saint Patrick Hollyman, gallery owner and creator, grew up in a family of photographers and filmmakers, and was exposed to many of his parents’ colleagues who were some of photography’s great masters. His mother, Jean Burnes Hollyman, led a distinguished photographic career from 1938 through the 1980s in fashion and editorial. His father, Thomas Benton Hollyman, was a successful photojournalist and led a storied career from 1936-1975. His sister, Stephenie Hollyman, is also well known and works today, having photographed all over the world for decades, and has published several fine photographic books. His stepmother, Audrey Bingham Hollyman, was a well-known “super agent” in New York City for Norman Parkinson, the photographer for the British Royal Family. Burnes decided early on that the world didn't need yet another photographer from his family and opened a photo gallery instead. Amanda Gorence, our Gallery’s Director, has years of experience helping curate and run L. Nowlin Gallery, which was located in our space prior to us. Amanda helps curate and develop new shows and projects at B. Hollyman Gallery. Amanda’s primary interest lies in championing and promoting new and established talent both in the Austin community and internationally.

The complex serves a growing audience 12 months of the year. The Symphony Square Project, begun in 1971, was conceived and directed by prominent citizens on a wave of civic awareness. It was sponsored jointly by the Austin Urban Renewal Agency, the City of Austin, and the Austin Symphony Orchestra. The Square is within easy walking distance of Capitol grounds, the LBJ Library and other downtown Austin tourist attractions. The Jeremiah Hamilton Building is an attractive, triangular building at the corner of 11th and Red River. It is thought to be one of only three stone triangular buildings still standing today in Texas. It houses the Box Office and Facilities Office of the Austin Symphony. Jeremiah Hamilton, one of nine black legislators serving in the 12th Texas Legislature from 1869-1871, built it in 1871. In addition to the Hamilton Building, Symphony Square contains the Michael Doyle House, considered on of the few remaining good examples of a simple, one-story vernacular stone cottage in Austin. It is serves as the home to the Women’s Symphony League of Austin. The third building is the Hardeman House, which was moved from its original location in East Austin and serves as home to Serranos, a popular restaurant serving Tex-Mex food. The fourth building is the New Orleans Club Mercantile, at one time a popular Austin nightclub and now a beautifully restored 19th century building serving as a space for private parties catered by Serranos. The property also includes a 350-seat stone amphitheater where the Austin Symphony hosts Children’s Day Art Park every Wednesday morning in June and July for youngsters from pre-school through age nine. Children’s Day Art Park features performances by local entertainers, an Instrument "Petting Zoo," storytelling and arts activities under a large tent next to the Doyle House.

Dancers are trained in the classical Russian method, or the Vaganova technique. The technique emphasizes correct body mechanics and positioning to create beautiful lines and fluid movement, as well as to protect the dancer from injury. As a student of Austin Classical Ballet, I have seen my technique improve rapidly in the two years that I have been with the school. I transferred from a multiform studio because I wanted to focus on ballet, and I have been continually impressed by the professionalism and talent of the director, Jennifer Felkner, and by the dedication of my classmates. I only regret that I did not find the studio sooner. Whether you are interested in a career as a dancer, simply love to dance, or want to try something new, I highly recommend Austin School of Classical Ballet.

Faithful clientele would often stand in long lines for breakfast and lunch. In his quest to find a place to live, Joe Draker found himself knocking on opportunity’s door, literally. Joe had just moved back to Austin and was looking for a house to rent. One “For Rent” sign led him to the home of Maudie Wilson Hamilton. Joe was inquiring about renting the house next door. As he turned to walk away, Maudie’s daughter, Bennie yelled out…”Hey, you wouldn’t wanna buy a café, would ya?” This piqued Joe’s interest, so he went back in to visit with Maudie – who was now in poor health. He thought it sounded like a pretty good idea. So, in just a matter of time, Joe Draker became the proud owner of Maudie’s Café on Lake Austin Blvd. When he bought the restaurant in 1992, Joe changed the menu to Tex-Mex. What didn’t change was the way people flocked to Maudie’s for the delicious food. Maudie’s has won numerous awards over the years for its Tex-Mex food and fresh-squeezed margaritas. With five successful city restaurants, Maudie’s has become a true tradition in Austin. If Maudie were here today, we think she’d be pretty proud to see what’s going on. Thanks for checking us out! Come visit us soon. We predict you’ll become one of the Maudie’s regulars!

Before it was Chuy’s, it was an old barbecue joint that had since shut its doors. And in 1982 when owners, Mike Young & John Zapp found it, there was seating for about sixty, a dirt parking lot, a women’s restroom the size of a broom closet & a men’s room that was, uh, outside. So they decided to turn it into a Mexican food restaurant. Problem was, they had zero budget to get started, including the restaurant décor. Fortunately, they didn’t let that stop them. The décor was simple. After all, there was only $20.00 to work with. Yes, the decimal point is in the right place. So Mike headed out the door with his $20 & guaranteed John he’d be back with something. As he puts it, “You can’t fake cheap.” It didn’t take long for him to spot a vendor selling velvet paintings on the side of the road. He bought two, Stevie Wonder & Elvis & brought back the change. Walls were done, the floor was next. “We could never decide on a floor tile color,” says Mike “So we chose a bunch of colors & laid them out to look like we planned it that way.” Soon after, the doors opened & their plan to serve fresh, tasty, affordably priced Tex-Mex became a reality. Average entree is $7.79.

It's a place where Shiner is considered a premium beer, where barbecue is served from a van in the parking lot and folks slip next door for shots at Stardust. If it gets too loud inside, there's an open-ended shed to one side and a picnic table in the field out back. The bartender can introduce you around." - Xlent Magazine / Austin American Statesman

The Scoot Inn, which began as a railroad saloon sometime around 1871, has been claimed to be one of the oldest running bars in Texas. East Austin was teeming with warehouses, railroad workers, and rich bankers living along East 1st, as well as a vibrant mix of Hispanics, African Americans and Anglos. In 1940, Scoot Ivy and his buddy Red, opened Red’s Scoot Inn after a long succession of owners who operated even through the Depression and Prohibition. They catered to railroadmen and workers who needed a beer after a long journey or after a day's work at a nearby factory or warehouse. Scoot and Red were reportededly big drinkers, throwing back as many as seven cases daily. “They started early,” according to our buddy, Don, from East End Lumber Company. They owned the business until 1980, when they died in their late 70’s. Not bad for two old salties. There were some dark years that we are trying to uncover after Scoot and Red's tenure, and the Scoot even caught fire during this period. It was rebuilt in the 90’s and in 1997, was run by our friend, Vera Sandaval. Vera and her mother, Red, kept a close eye on things and brought in a better crowd. The Longbranch acquired the Scoot Inn in December 2006; the 2 bars are now collectively known at the EAST INNS. We have major renovation plans in place to bring back the old Inn feel of the interior and expand the bier garden with many locally brewed draft beers and some old national favorites. The Scoot Inn will feature more live music than the Longbranch...

NYOS was founded in 1998 by a group of parents who wanted better for their children. A better academic program. A better learning environment. Better instructional tools. We strive toward these ideals every day. Because NYOS is a public charter school, all students are required to take the TAKS tests. But you won't find any "drill and kill" at NYOS. No "teaching for the test". We believe that students should learn first and the rest will take care of itself. Our academic program focuses on cognitive learning and problem solving. NYOS uses proven programs to go beyond teaching students "what". Students explore the "how" and "why" and learn the best ways to find the answers for themselves. And while teaching is the primary mission of a school, NYOS builds a culture of community responsibility. Every family is required to volunteer at least 20 hours for the school per year. Students are encouraged to be part of the larger community as well. From recycling programs to food drives and beyond, students learn that giving back to the community is just as important as learning about it.

And while you wouldn’t know it from looking at it, it’s quietly become one of the most important venues in the city, all thanks to one man: Jon Hoff, punk aficionado and adherent of the DIY approach to booking that fed the ’80s hardcore scene and helped nurture the careers of bands like Minor Threat and Black Flag. Hoff’s forte for putting together local and touring shows, combined with his personal political bent (the venue has played host to benefits dedicated to ending the death penalty, among other hot-button topics), has made The Broken Neck a destination for people who take their noise and aggression seriously, while providing a home for punk that’s blessedly far from the madding crowd of Sixth Street. Decider spoke with Hoff about all the work that goes into building a place for people to tear things down.

Gallery owner Joe Sigel opened the gallery almost 10 years ago, realizing the need for a contemporary gallery in Austin and he introduced a collection of works by Picasso, Miro, Andy Warhol and others. Since then the gallery has evolved along with Austin’s constantly changing tastes, and now carries one of the largest collections of the Secret Art of Dr. Seuss. The gallery also showcases original contemporary works that don’t fit any genre, from Daniella Foletto’s prehistoric cave horse paintings to Cynthia Chartier’s mixed media figures, to Paul Stankiewicz’s side-show hand-crank paintings. Along with its ongoing exhibits of framed artwork, ART on 5th welcomes touring exhibitions from Washington, Chicago and Montreal, to name a few. The gallery has also hosted the artwork of Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones, Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane and other notable musician/ artists. In addition to an amazing selection of fine art, ART on 5th is also the premier custom framer of choice in town. The gallery has carefully chosen a huge selection of frames from over ten different suppliers to ensure that they have the perfect design for your project. Stop by one of Austin’s best-known art experiences and see what’s new!

Our goal is to provide the means and knowledge of meditation to everyone, so they will come to the point of true and lasting happiness. Although Meditation is oftentimes thought to be nothing more than a method for stress relief and the improvement of physical health, the real value of meditation goes far beyond these benefits. The immediately noticeable effects of meditation are that we feel a little lighter, less burdened by artificial “needs” and desires. We become calmer and more relaxed. Gradually we will develop insight into our true needs and learn how to attain real satisfaction and happiness. Through meditation we can start to bring into our lives greater understanding of who we are, our purpose for being here and where real happiness lies. Meditation provides insights into the workings of the mind and emotions. It further helps you develop clarity and wisdom, gaining a greater understanding of life. The art of meditation has been practiced by saints and sages to bring about the joyful state of self-realization. In this consciousness a person is free from temporary worries, anxieties, and concerns and is immersed in a higher spiritual happiness and inner peacefulness. In accordance with the ancient teaching of Meditation, all our programs are free of charge.

Kuk Sool Won™ is not a sport, nor is it simply another self-defense method. Kuk Sool Won™ is a complete martial arts system that is dedicated to the cultivation of mental and physical strength and well-being and to the preservation of traditional Martial Arts. Kuk Sool Won™ has been actively promoted worldwide by the World Kuk Sool Association®, and it is also recognized in the martial arts community as one of the most effective and comprehensive systems of traditional Korean Martial Arts in existence today. Kuk Sool Won™ was formally systemized in 1958 by Grandmaster Suh, In Hyuk and the association was officially founded in 1961 in Korea. A quality unique to Kuk Sool Won™ is the Association (WKSA) and the fact that the Association has kept the traditional Korean Martial Art of Kuk Sool Won™ pure, and will continue to do so throughout the world. So, no matter where you may travel or live, once you have joined Kuk Sool Won™ and the Association, you can practice the same Kuk Sool Won™ curriculum whether you are in Texas, California, New York, Canada, Puerto Rico, Europe, or Korea! For self-defense, Kuk Sool Won™ is unsurpassed. It combines kicking, punching, throwing, choking, joint-locking, and a myriad of weapons techniques, into a beautiful and dynamic "hard-soft" style emphasizing speed and fluidity. Philosophically, Kuk Sool Won™ stresses humility, self-discipline, self-control, loyalty and respect for others. Together, these aspects of Kuk Sool Won™ provide the means for attaining a long and healthy life. Kuk Sool Won™ can benefit men, women, and children. Through diligent practice, Kuk Sool Won™ training will develop strength, quickness, balance, timing, flexibility and coordination. At the same time, powers of concentration, self-discipline and self-control significantly improve. In addition, faithful practice will enhance circulation and digestion, reduce problems of the back and joints, aid in weight loss and help to develop and maintain a youthful appearance. These benefits will positively affect all aspects of your life.

Although the actual buildings and locations have changed over the years, what hasn’t changed is FPC’s commitment to live--and to invite others to live--a thoughtful, heart-felt authentic faith. FPC has always sought to be a leader in social and personal transformation. During the American Civil War FPC aligned with the Northern Presbyterian Church while every other Texas Presbyterian Church aligned with the Southern Presbyterian Church. After the Civil War, Pastor E.B. Wright established FPC as a place of reconciliation and grace, as FPC encouraged former enemies to ask for God’s blessings, and for one another’s forgiveness. North/South, Former Slaves/Former Slaveholders, People of Faith/People of Doubt—all joined together to seek out a better way of life and service. The desire to be a place of reconciliation and grace, of acceptance and inclusion, continued throughout FPC’s history, and continues to this day. Men and Women, Gay and Straight members all serve equally in church leadership. (Even Youth share in important leadership roles.) In addition to radical grace, FPC has brought from its past literal pieces of its history, our beautiful stained glass windows. Set in a spacious contemporary sanctuary, each Sunday they preach powerful sermons—about bright light manifesting in many colors, about profound tradition prompting a progressive faith.

Successfully marrying technology to art, Austin artist Adreon Henry addresses individual persona and existence, its shifting role from physical to cyber, and the convenience, freedom and danger it offers in his upcoming site-specific installation, E-Z Egos and Effigies. Aside from its Street art aesthetic, the installation’s timely embrace of technology, multidimensional representation, and social relevance make for an engaging body of work. While offering new works in mediums and styles Henry is known for (vinyl screen- printing and sketch art), Henry focuses on social media and technology, investigating its affects on our social existence as individuals and communities. E-Z Egos and Effigies is an experience that invokes conversations about our cyber identities and communities. With the inclusion of QR codes Henry offers a transformation of his paintings from "physical" to "cyber" by creating a proof of existence with cyber and social media tools. The show is unique, offering viewers both a physical and digital experience. To see more: adreonhenry.com

The work of Elsi Lemus, who is originally from El Salvador and does much of the cooking, the menu offers many uncomplicated, but very distinctive dishes.A good example are enchiladas with poblano sauce, the Wednesday lunch special. The corn tortillas, wrapped around shredded chicken that had been cooked with diced tomatoes and peppers, are covered with a smooth poblano sauce that dominated the dish. A few shreds of melted cheese garnish the enchiladas but don't interfere with the taste of the poblano.The plate is served with moist rice and soupy charra beans - cooked with bacon, bell peppers and onions - that are very delicious.A Salvadoran chile relleno, the Thursday lunch special, features a pepper stuffed with tender chunks of pork, potatoes and rice, battered with egg, fried and topped with a tomato sauce. While appearing identical to a Mexican chile relleno, the spices of the sauce provided their own distinct flavor.This is what distinguishes the Salvadoran aspects of the food: spices outside the typical Tex-Mex arena.In a more Mexican venue, the chalupas compuestas covered with refried beans, ground beef, guacamole, shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes are offered. The banana-leaf tamales - pork, chicken or vegetarian poblano - are offered on Saturday and Sunday, and they are a real treat. Elsi's Restaurant has established itself as one of the area's favorite culinary destinations and is sure tooffer you a pleasant and unique dining experience every time you visit. So, stop in soon!

These original dishes formed the basis of an ever-evolving "Texas Cuisine."During the past few years innovative chefs have reached into the larder of all the ethnic groups forming Texas, drawing on the sum of all those flavorful parts and expanded on current day ingredients.The plethora of information and resources from cowboys and ranches, the Gulf coast and rivers, hunting, fishing, the cattle and citrus industry, border towns and Hispanic culture early German settlements and the hill Country, have all inspired the chefs at Banderas to create a menu that embodies the many flavors of Texas.To compliment the rich history of tastes in foods, we paired it with wines that have an equally rich history. The Franciscans, Mexican missions, and German immigrants generally acknowledged to be the most successful grape growers and wine makers, contributed to some of the interesting and complex local wines made by passionate Texas Vintners today. Join us in celebrating Texas food and wine.

In 1994 the Austin Parks Foundation and the Trust for Public Land helped the city acquire 228 of the parks 363 acres of land. In the years since, Austin Parks Foundation has continued to foster new partnerships and provided new resources for the park. In 1998, Austin Parks Foundation led a successful effort to pass $10 million in bonds to pay for development of the park. As a first step, Austin Parks Foundation funded and led the master planning process. The master plan, approved in 1999, incorporates the ideas and dreams of a broad spectrum of Austin's community members. The great urban park envisioned includes community gardens, multi-use recreation areas, nature trails, a performance pavilion, a children's adventure playscape, and benches along scenic river overlooks. In 2001, The City of Austin honored Mr. Roy G. Guerrero, fondly known as "Mr. Recreation", by adding his name to the park. During his many years of loving service to the Parks Department, Guerrero became an inspiration to thousands of young people and one of Austin's most loved and respected men. In the past few years, Austin Parks Foundation has held numerous volunteer events at the park involving hundreds of volunteers.

If you can't get it right in that many years, you might as well give up.Central Texans are glad they didn't. Morris Melchor's barbeque is the real deal, and anyone lucky enough to have discovered Smokey Mo's will agree.Morris, a native Texan, started his restaurant career in a relatively unspectacular way: washing dishes at the Longhorn Barbeque restaurant where his mother worked. He was all of twelve years old at the time. Morris later joined the Luther's Barbeque chain, working his way up from kitchen staff, to kitchen manager and eventually to general manager. It was during this time that Morris met his future wife, Lisa.Lisa moved from her home state of New York and started working at Luther's after high school graduation. Morris and Lisa were married in 1982, and have worked together since that first meeting. As the years passed the couple moved from Luther's to Rally's Hamburgers in Miami, eventually landing in Austin with a local barbeque chain. As general manager, Morris helped establish three Austin area restaurants. After years of lending their experience to the opening of restaurants for family and friends, the Melchors decided to take the plunge themselves, Opening Smokey Mo's in Cedar Park. Business is booming and they've never looked back."Everything just fell into place after Lisa and I decided to open this restaurant," says Morris. "God has played a major part in this - that's why it has gone so smoothly." One thing that all of Morris and Lisa's customers can agree on - Barbeque from Smokey Mo's is heaven on earth!

Exotic, eclectic, and emotional! South Slavic manuscripts from the Balkans inspired artist Tatiana Nikolova-Houston. She raised funds to preserve them as cultural artifacts, and she studied the messages they carried down through the ages. Hidden under centuries of foreign occupation, their voices speak of people marginalized by the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, Greek, and Soviet empires. Their scribes struggled to create without gold or pigments; with proscribed ink and paper. Yet, the scribes created, borrowing from Byzantine, Celtic, and Islamic traditions and from their native Balkan folk arts. Each pattern resembles a labyrinth--a labyrinth of intertwining pathways incorporate vines, flowers, unicorns, dragons, birds, and iconic faces--pathways that lead to a unifying center where God resides. Now, for the first time, these illuminations receive the treatment their scribes intended. Now, the ancient patterns appear with the gold, colors, and jewels that ILLUMINATE and INSPIRE our souls and allow us to TRANSCEND our earthly lives, to UNITE the Human and Divine, and to achieve union with God: THEOSIS.

In the posh district of Mexico City know as the Zona Rosa, elegant diners and chic eateries were the norm and Carlos Anderson's tried to refine the upscale dining experience, right down to his tuxedo and necktie requisite. The swank façade lasted almost a week. The impulsive Anderson decided that it was time to do away with the standards and the tradition was born. Carlos began to chat idly with patrons and drumming up business from the street, which at the time was unheard of for a restaurant manager to do. Although the other local businesses thought of this as an outrage, Mexico City patrons reacted instantly to this avant-garde way of customer service. After a year of working 24 hours a day, Carlos asked Barry Shaw to put on an apron and the rest is history. With the help of longtime friends Chuy Juearez, Charlie Skipsey, and Ronnie Hopps, the group has opened a total of more than 100 restaurants throughout Spain, Brazil, and the United States. Do not confuse Carlos'N Charlie's with big business, for this is a family business. "We're a family here" explains Barry Shaw, "we do not hire managers, we raise them." This was another groundbreaking concept incorporated by Carlos Anderson which is still being implemented today. We, at Lake Travis, Austin Texas, are proud to be the first Carlos'N Charlie's operating in the United States. We are committed to the standards of image and continuity, and with providing excellent service, excellent food and fun. Everyday we plan to live up to the legend that is…… Carlos'N Charlie's.

Part of our unique identity is that we come from all walks of life and yet are unified in the Spirit of Christ. Membership certainly has its benefits—people who care, a family to love and a vision to pursue. For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body— whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit. For in fact the body is not one member but many. (1 Cor. 12:12-14) At Texas Oaks Baptist Church, we reference the above passage to emphasize the responsibility of every member to fill the role God has for them in the body. We desire to lead people into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ, grow them into maturity, and equip them to serve others through the power of the Holy Spirit working within them.

The answer is Fabi and Rosi European Kitchen, owned by Austin native Cassie Williamson and her husband, German-born chef Wolfgang Murber, who opened the restaurant Friday . The couple met two years when Murber was a chef on a private yacht in Spain after studying in Germany and cooking in Italy, Williamson said. Murber moved to Williamson's home in the Clarksville neighborhood, and the couple began searching for a cozy old house where he could put his multinational experience to work. They saw Zoot's old home lying vacant and worked out an agreement with the landlord. The menu at Fabi and Rosi (pronounced "fab-ee and roe-zee," and named for Fabio and Rosalie, the couple's nephew and niece) is an ambitious one-stop tour of European cooking: escargot, charcuterie, short-rib Bolognese, paella, schnitzel and more, with main-course prices from $12 to $21. Until the liquor license comes through, the restaurant allows beer and wine to be carried in.\\n-- Mike Sutter, AMERICAN-STATESMAN RESTAURANT CRITIC
